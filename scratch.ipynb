The question is asking for the dimensions in centimeters, and the options are A, B, C, D.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall any information I have about this painting. Viktor Vasnetsov was a Russian artist known for his historical and mythological themes. \"Moving House\" might be one of his works, but I\\'m not immediately familiar with it. Maybe it\\'s also known by a different title? Sometimes translations can vary.\\n\\nAssuming the title is accurate, I\\'ll try to think of Vasnetsov\\'s other works. He has famous pieces like \"Bogatyrs\" or \"Alyonushka,\" but those are larger in scale. However, \"Moving House\" might be a smaller genre painting. If I can\\'t remember the exact dimensions, I might need to deduce based on typical sizes for such paintings.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of other paintings by Vasnetsov and their sizes. For example, \"Alyonushka\" is 173 cm × 121 cm, which is quite large. But genre scenes might be smaller. Wait, \"Moving House\" sounds like a domestic scene, perhaps a smaller canvas. The options given are all around 50-70 cm, which seems plausible for a genre painting.\\n\\nNow, looking at the options: A is 53.5 x 67.2, B is 48.3 x 61.7, C is 55.8 x 70.4, D is 51.2 x 64.9. These are all relatively close. Without specific knowledge, it\\'s tricky. Maybe I can check if any of these dimensions correspond to known works. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that Vasnetsov\\'s \"The Flying Carpet\" is 165 x 297 cm, which is much larger, so that\\'s not helpful here.\\n\\nWait, maybe \"Moving House\" is part of a series or a specific period. If I can\\'t remember, perhaps I should look for clues in the numbers. Let\\'s see: Option C is the largest in both dimensions. If the painting is a more detailed scene, maybe a slightly larger size. Alternatively, maybe the aspect ratio can help. Let\\'s calculate the ratios:\\n\\nA: 53.5/67.2 ≈ 0.796 (approx 4:5)\\nB: 48.3/61.7 ≈ 0.783 (similar)\\nC: 55.8/70.4 ≈ 0.792\\nD: 51.2/64.9 ≈ 0.789\\n\\nAll ratios are close to 0.79, which is roughly 4:5. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can think of common canvas sizes. Standard sizes might be in inches converted to cm. For example, a 20x24 inch canvas is about 50.8x61 cm, which is close to option B (48.3x61.7). But Vasnetsov was Russian, so maybe he used metric measurements or traditional Russian sizes. Not sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps looking for any online references. Wait, but since I can\\'t actually look it up, I have to rely on memory. If I remember that \"Moving House\" (Переезд) by Viktor Vasnetsov is indeed 48.3 x 61.7 cm, then B would be correct. But I\\'m not certain. Alternatively, maybe another option. \\n\\nWait, another approach: sometimes dimensions are listed in art catalogs. If I recall that Vasnetsov\\'s \"Moving House\" is in the Tretyakov Gallery, maybe their website lists the dimensions. But again, without access, I have to guess. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is B. Because 48.3 cm is approximately 19 inches (19*2.54=48.26), and 61.7 cm is approximately 24.3 inches (24.3*2.54≈61.7). So 19x24 inches converted to cm would be around 48.3x61.7, which matches option B. Since artists sometimes use standard inch sizes, especially in older times, this might be a possibility.

The question asks for its dimensions in centimeters, with four options provided. I need to figure out which one is correct.\\n\\nFirst, I should recall any information I know about Viktor Vasnetsov. He was a Russian artist known for his historical and mythological scenes. But \"Moving House\" doesn\\'t ring a bell immediately. Maybe it\\'s one of his lesser-known works? Alternatively, perhaps the title is translated differently. Sometimes artworks have varying English titles, so maybe I should check the original Russian title if possible.\\n\\nNext, I\\'ll consider the options. The sizes given are all in centimeters, and they\\'re relatively close to each other. The differences are a few centimeters each way. Without prior knowledge, this might be tricky. \\n\\nIf I can\\'t remember the exact dimensions, maybe there\\'s a way to deduce it based on common painting sizes or Vasnetsov\\'s typical formats. However, artists can vary their canvas sizes depending on the work. Another approach is to think if any of these options correspond to standard canvas sizes. For example, 53.5 x 67.2 cm might be close to a 20x26 inch conversion (since 1 inch is approx 2.54 cm). Let me check: 20 inches is about 50.8 cm, 26 inches is about 66.04 cm. Option A is 53.5x67.2, which is slightly larger. Option D is 51.2x64.9, which is closer to 20x25.5 inches. But I\\'m not sure if that helps.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of other paintings by Vasnetsov. For example, his famous works like \"Bogatyrs\" are much larger. But \"Moving House\" might be a smaller genre scene. If I recall, some of his genre works are medium-sized. But again, without specific knowledge, this is a stretch.\\n\\nAnother angle: perhaps the options are based on actual sources. If I could search online, I\\'d look up the painting\\'s dimensions. But since I can\\'t, maybe I can think if any of these numbers seem familiar. For instance, option C is 55.8x70.4 cm. Converting those to inches: 55.8/2.54 ≈ 22 inches, 70.4/2.54 ≈ 27.7 inches. That\\'s a bit large for a genre painting, perhaps. Option B is 48.3x61.7 cm, which is roughly 19x24.3 inches. That seems plausible for a smaller work.\\n\\nWait, maybe I remember that some sources list \"Moving House\" (Переезд) as 53.5 x 67.2 cm. If that\\'s the case, then option A would be correct. But how confident am I? Alternatively, maybe I\\'m mixing it up with another painting. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is D: 51.2 x64.9 cm. But I\\'m not sure. Without concrete knowledge, this is a bit of a guess. However, if I have to choose based on possible conversions or typical sizes, maybe option A is the most likely. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that sometimes dimensions are listed in different sources with slight variations due to measurement differences. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is C. Wait, I\\'m getting confused. Let me try to think again. If I remember correctly, Vasnetsov\\'s \"Moving House\" is a smaller painting, perhaps around 50-something cm in width. The options given are all in that range. \\n\\nWait, perhaps I can recall that Viktor Vasnetsov\\'s \"Moving House\" (Переезд с старого дома) was painted in 1876, and its dimensions are listed as 53.5 x 67.2 cm. If that\\'s accurate, then option A is correct. But I\\'m not entirely certain. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is D. Hmm. Since I can\\'t verify, I\\'ll have to go with the option that I think is most likely. If I remember seeing somewhere that option A is correct, then I\\'ll choose A. Otherwise, if I\\'m unsure, perhaps I should look for another clue. Wait, perhaps the aspect ratio can help. Let\\'s calculate the aspect ratios:\\n\\nA: 53.5/67.2 ≈ 0.796 (approx 4:5)\\nB: 48.3/61.7 ≈ 0.783 (approx 11:14)\\nC: 55.8/70.4 ≈ 0.792 (approx 4:5)\\nD:51.2/64.9 ≈ 0.789 (approx 11:14)\\n\\nNot sure if that helps. Maybe the original painting\\'s aspect ratio is a standard one. If the painting is more square, but I don\\'t know. \\n\\nGiven all this uncertainty, and if I have to make an educated guess, I might lean towards option A. But I\\'m not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D. \\n\\nWait, perhaps I should think of other Vasnetsov paintings. For example, \"Alyonushka\" is 173 × 121 cm, which is much larger. \"Ivan Tsarevich on the Grey Wolf\" is 249 × 187 cm. So his historical/mythological works are large. His genre scenes might be smaller. \"Moving House\" is a genre scene, so perhaps smaller. The options given are all around 50-70 cm, which fits. \\n\\nIf I recall correctly, \"Moving House\" is indeed around 53 x 67 cm, which would be option A. But I\\'m not 100% certain. However, given the options, I\\'ll go with A.\\n'), native_finish_reason='stop')], created=1759176638, model='deepseek/deepseek-r1', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=1206, prompt_tokens=159, total_tokens=1365, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), provider='DeepInfra')\n",

      "To take off, simply hold the toggle switch forward. The props turn slowly in unison—calibrating, calibrating—then spool furiously, a squadron of lawn mowers on deck.

By virtue of its human-factors engineering and flight-control automation, the BlackFly can be mastered by almost anyone with a few days’ training, roughly comparable to the requirements for a driver’s license. Nor is age any barrier. The craft’s joystick controller is practically instinctive to game-trained teenagers. The oldest BlackFly-certified pilot is 88.\n",

But because the BlackFly qualifies as an ultralight aircraft (254 pounds, or less), the FAA doesn’t require pilots to pass any kind of medical test. Hell, even the DMV requires an eye test now and then.\n",

      "I am not a pilot nor do I aspire to be one. My interest dates back to my time living in Los Angeles. We had a house at the top of Mount Washington where, on a clear day, I could see the downtown skyscrapers surrounding my office—five minutes, as the crow flies. In a car, the same trip represented an hour or more of hell.\n",

      "Around the same time, Marcus Leng was building the car of my dreams in his basement. In 2011, the Canadian entrepreneur and flying enthusiast tested his first boxy prototype, reaching an altitude of 10 feet. By 2014, Google emeritus Larry Page had added Leng’s startup to his growing portfolio of eVTOL investments. That same year, the company moved to Palo Alto, Calif., and by 2021, the series-production prototype was ready. At that year’s EAA AirAdventure, in Oshkosh, Wis., the BlackFly debuted to a gobsmacked planet.\n",

      "What sorcery is this? In the emerging taxonomy of eVTOLs, the BlackFly is known as a tilt-aircraft design. Unlike tilt-rotor designs, the rotors here are fixed; the BlackFly takes off and lands propulsively by rotation of the entire craft. These aerodynamics account for the BlackFly’s slightly mad landing dance: sweeping dramatically to a tailstand, turning slowly into the wind, then lowering itself onto its rocker-shaped bottom, amid a cloud of blown-away spectators.\n",
      "\n",
      "A branding reboot in 2023 changed the company name from Opener to Pivotal. Production of the BlackFly ended late last year; Pivotal is now taking orders for an upgraded version called the Helix, with a sticker price of $190,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most eVTOLs startups in the news—like Joby Aviation—are developing autonomously controlled air taxis, with or without backup pilots on board. Analysts studying advanced air mobility (AAM) see autonomous ride-sharing machines facing huge public resistance. The no-pilot idea really rattles people.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Casey Branham (left), an integration technician at Pivotal, checks the BlackFly aircraft during assembly (right) in preparation for the author’s test flight. Pontoons on the wings permit the craft to take off and land on water.\n",
      "Yet in some ways, Pivotal’s technology is even more audacious, in that it puts a human pilot—potentially a squirmy, Earth-hugging rookie like me—squarely into the control loop of a flying machine. With great respect and catered lunches provided, Pivotal requires buyers to complete a ground school at their offices in Palo Alto. Trainees wear VR headsets and sit in motor-driven rocking chairs that approximate the rearing-horse verticality of landing or taking off.\n",
      "\n",
      "In VR, as in real life, the BlackFly practically flies itself; the pilot only points it in the desired direction. The flight controller’s guidance/navigation/control (GNC) software maintains stability and attitude by manipulating differences in thrust among the eight rotors, much like a typical camera drone. These thrust differentials are coordinated with dual flaps on the trailing edges of the stubby wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hear those props? The way they speed and slow, roar and snore, constantly balancing thrust to counteract changing winds? Should the BlackFly turn into a strong tailwind, for example, the rpm of all eight props will slow rather dramatically in order to maintain constant air speed. For an instant it sounds like you are going to fall out of the sky. The BlackFly flies on, straight and level. In an airplane or helicopter, you’d be handling that workload for yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pivotal often trains pilots at a farm near Watsonville, Calif., adjacent to La Selva Beach. Here the author is descending from about 300 feet as he prepares to transition to Hover mode for landing.\n",
      "To ensure safe handling, the GNC bakes in a number of control laws that constrain responses to inputs—it’s impossible to stall the BlackFly, for instance, or put one into an unrecoverable spin. Such self-protective algorithms would be familiar to anyone who has piloted a camera drone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, owners must be prepared in case the automated systems fail. What if you lose GPS-assisted ground lock and/or the ground-sensing radar, requiring you to freehand the landing? What if you fly into a flock of ducks and lose a prop due to birdstrike—or a shot from an irate duck hunter? In dire emergencies, pilots may resort to the mortar-propelled parachute, designed to lower the craft safely to the ground, baby and all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pivotal’s peppermint-scented training room became my personal Vietnam. I am plagued by motion sickness, of which the most pernicious variety is “sim sickness.” My first attempt to master the simulator was in August. After three hellish days in a drooling, Dramamine-induced coma, I failed my check ride.\n",

      "Above, flight instructor Alex Miller observes as the author practices emergency procedures in Pivotal’s virtual-reality simulator. The training rig for the aircraft’s parachute (bottom) approximates the position and pull-weight of the ripcord.\n",
      "I returned to Palo Alto in early September, with new eyeglasses, a prescription for the anti-emetic Zofran and a surplus-store flight suit. Four days later, I was approved to fly the real thing. Call sign: Upchuck Yeager.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I promise you won’t feel any of that in the real thing,” said Sabrina Alesna, one of four of the licensed pilot instructors it took to get me in the air. She was right.\n",
      "\n",
      "I arrived the next morning at an agricultural estate near Watsonville, Calif., where Pivotal does many of its customer checkout flights. A two-story hangar and grassy runway are situated among 400 acres of cultivated fields and grow houses owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. As the morning marine layer burned off it revealed miles of dreamy California coastline, with sand cliffs tumbling to the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having spent hours flying over its virtual simulacrum, I knew the place well. I was especially wary of the big tree at the edge of the cliffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The support crew unloaded two machines from their Wells Cargo trailers. That way one could charge while the other flew. A BlackFly painted in EMS livery waited for me in the silvery grass. After the walk-around inspection, I fastened my chin strap and hoisted myself into the bare-carbon cockpit. As she had done many times in the simulator, Alesna walked me through the preflight checklist. “You’re cleared for takeoff,” I heard her say. And off I flew, tickety-boo.\n",

      "As cool as it would be to land on the roof of your office like George Jetson, federal regulations forbid ultralights and experimental aircraft from overflying populated areas—cities, suburbs, highway corridors, etc. Nor can they fly at night or in bad weather. These restrictions effectively rule out widespread adoption of eVTOLs for urban commuting. While Pivotal’s technology is bursting with practical possibilities, the BlackFly itself cannot be but a toy—a glorious, wonderful toy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, like any toy—at least any that fly—you could potentially hurt yourself, if you put your mind to it. What the FAA calls uncontrolled airspace is hardly free of conflict. In fact, I found my time in the air pretty freaking dynamic, what with the flocks of stupid birds and the trees and the Navy helicopter roaring down the beach at 200 knots. I had to keep my head on a swivel.\n",

      "Question: Is an eVTOL that just about any idiot can fly necessarily a good thing? What happens when bucks-up barnstormers start crashing into each other off Point Dume or over Burning Man?\n",

    "To ensure safe handling, the GNC bakes in a number of control laws that constrain responses to inputs—it’s impossible to stall the BlackFly, for instance, or put one into an unrecoverable spin. Such self-protective algorithms would be familiar to anyone who has piloted a camera drone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, owners must be prepared in case the automated systems fail. What if you lose GPS-assisted ground lock and/or the ground-sensing radar, requiring you to freehand the landing? What if you fly into a flock of ducks and lose a prop due to birdstrike—or a shot from an irate duck hunter? In dire emergencies, pilots may resort to the mortar-propelled parachute, designed to lower the craft safely to the ground, baby and all.\n",

    "Pivotal’s peppermint-scented training room became my personal Vietnam. I am plagued by motion sickness, of which the most pernicious variety is “sim sickness.” My first attempt to master the simulator was in August. After three hellish days in a drooling, Dramamine-induced coma, I failed my check ride.\n",

    "“I promise you won’t feel any of that in the real thing,” said Sabrina Alesna, one of four of the licensed pilot instructors it took to get me in the air. She was right.\n",

    "I arrived the next morning at an agricultural estate near Watsonville, Calif., where Pivotal does many of its customer checkout flights. A two-story hangar and grassy runway are situated among 400 acres of cultivated fields and grow houses owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. As the morning marine layer burned off it revealed miles of dreamy California coastline, with sand cliffs tumbling to the shore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having spent hours flying over its virtual simulacrum, I knew the place well. I was especially wary of the big tree at the edge of the cliffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The support crew unloaded two machines from their Wells Cargo trailers. That way one could charge while the other flew. A BlackFly painted in EMS livery waited for me in the silvery grass. After the walk-around inspection, I fastened my chin strap and hoisted myself into the bare-carbon cockpit. As she had done many times in the simulator, Alesna walked me through the preflight checklist. “You’re cleared for takeoff,” I heard her say. And off I flew, tickety-boo.\n",

    "As cool as it would be to land on the roof of your office like George Jetson, federal regulations forbid ultralights and experimental aircraft from overflying populated areas—cities, suburbs, highway corridors, etc. Nor can they fly at night or in bad weather. These restrictions effectively rule out widespread adoption of eVTOLs for urban commuting. While Pivotal’s technology is bursting with practical possibilities, the BlackFly itself cannot be but a toy—a glorious, wonderful toy.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, like any toy—at least any that fly—you could potentially hurt yourself, if you put your mind to it. What the FAA calls uncontrolled airspace is hardly free of conflict. In fact, I found my time in the air pretty freaking dynamic, what with the flocks of stupid birds and the trees and the Navy helicopter roaring down the beach at 200 knots. I had to keep my head on a swivel.\n",

    "Pivotal flight instructor Sabrina Alesna talks the author through the preflight checklist. To keep the weight of the radio from counting against the vehicle maximum of 254 pounds, pilots strap the radio to themselves.\n",
    "Question: Is an eVTOL that just about any idiot can fly necessarily a good thing? What happens when bucks-up barnstormers start crashing into each other off Point Dume or over Burning Man?\n",
    "\n",
    "To an amazing degree, the FAA relies on ultralight pilots’ judgment and sense of self preservation. However, the rule book warns that if ultralights start to become a problem for the public, the FAA is ready to bring down the flyswatter.\n",
