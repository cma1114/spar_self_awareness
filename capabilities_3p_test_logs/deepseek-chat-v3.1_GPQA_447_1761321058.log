Consider an isolated system of 13 identical particles each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are
constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. What is the minimum energy (in Joules) of this system
correct to three decimals?
  A: 2.822 x 10^-26
  B: 122.330
  C: 5.645 x 10^-26
  D: 7.056 x 10^-27
----------
  A: <5%
  B: 5-10%
  C: 10-20%
  D: 20-40%
  E: 40-60%
  F: 60-80%
  G: 80-90%
  H: >90%
