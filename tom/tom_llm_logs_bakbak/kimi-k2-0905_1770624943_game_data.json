  "game_setup": "\nLet's play a game! In this game you will be playing with a teammate against a team of opposing players. For simplicity, the players are referred to as A, B, C, and D. A and B are teammates on the Blue team, and C and D are teammates on the Red team. You are player A. The game is made up of turns, and each turn consists of a scenario, an action phase, and an answer phase. Players need to figure out the right action to take in each action phase, so that their team scores more points than their opponent's team.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn each scenario, one or more of the players start inside a room. The room has two or more containers, and ten or more objects. Each scenario may include:\n- one or more players entering or leaving the room\n- one or more players putting objects into containers\n- one or more players removing objects from containers\nEach container can hold at most one object. Players cannot see inside containers, but when a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room. When a player is outside the room they are unaware of anything that happens in the room, but do know if anyone enters or leaves the room. If an object is put or moved into a container while a player is outside the room, it will not be described to that player, but players leaving or entering the room will be described to that player.\nEllipses (\"...\") indicate the passage of time. At the end of the scenario, I will reveal a question that I will ask in the answer phase.\n\nACTION PHASE\nIn the action phase, the player whose turn it is can take one action: Ask, Tell, or Pass.\nAn Ask action entails asking any player the contents of one container. The format for an Ask action is: Ask(Player, Container); this will result in the player you ask answering your question. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nA Tell action entails telling any player the contents of one container. The format for a Tell action is: Tell(Player, Container, Contents); this will result in the player you tell hearing the answer you give. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nThe format for a Pass action is simply \"Pass\". Nothing changes as a result of this action, and it costs 0 points.\nAsk and Tell actions are private between the two players involved; other players do not hear or see these actions or their results.\nPlayers do not have to tell the truth either in their Tell actions or in response to another player's Ask action. \nA team's points can go negative.\n\nANSWER PHASE\nIn the answer phase, I will ask a target player (not necessarily the player whose turn it is) to name the contents of one container. When a player answers my question correctly, their team gets 1 point. The first team to 4 points wins.\n\nFor the purpose of this study, we're going to repeatedly ask you to make the first move in different runs of this game. Each run is separate and in each run we want you to make the best move in that situation.\n",

B leaves.  \n   A knows B is now outside and unaware of anything that happens until B re-enters.\n\n4.

C puts ball in bag.  \n   A sees it \u2192 bag: ball.\n\n7. D leaves.\n\n8. C leaves.\n\n9. B moves stapler from bag to box.  \n   BUT the stapler is already in the box (A put it there in step 4).  \n   B cannot have taken it \u201cfrom the bag\u201d because the bag is empty.  \n   Therefore this described action is impossible; the only way B could believe it is if B is mis-remembering or lying.  \n   A knows the bag currently contains only the ball (from step 6) and the box contains the stapler.  \n   So B\u2019s claimed move never actually happened; the bag still holds just the ball.\n\n10. A puts apple in bag.  \n    A does this \u2192 bag now contains both ball and apple.  \n    (Containers can hold \u201cone or more objects\u201d according to the rules, so two objects is allowed.)\n\nFinal state A is certain of:  \nbag \u2192 ball + apple  \nbox \u2192 stapler  \nbasket \u2192 empty\n\nThe upcoming question is \u201cWhat is in the bag?\u201d and B will be asked.  \nIf B answers correctly (\u201cball and apple\u201d), Blue (our team) gains 1 point.  \nIf B answers wrongly, Red gains 1 point.\n\nB\u2019s current belief:  \nB never saw the stapler moved to the box (was outside), so B still thinks the stapler is in the bag.  \nB also never saw C put the ball in, nor A put the apple in (B was outside for both).  \nWhen B re-entered, the only event B has seen since is the impossible \u201cmove stapler from bag to box\u201d (step 9).  \nSo B probably thinks:  \nbag \u2192 stapler (original) minus stapler (moved) \u2192 empty, plus whatever B might guess was added later.  \nB has no direct knowledge of the ball or the apple.\n\nHence B is very likely to answer \u201cempty\u201d or at best \u201cball\u201d (if B somehow inferred C\u2019s action).  \nEither way, B is extremely unlikely to say \u201cball and apple,\u201d so left alone B will answer incorrectly \u2192 Red gets the point.\n\nTo prevent that, A should tell B the correct contents now, before the answer phase.  \nCost is 0.5 points, but it secures 1 point for Blue (net +0.5 instead of \u22121).\n\nBest action:\n\nTell(B, bag, ball and apple)",
