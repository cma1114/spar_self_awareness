  "game_setup": "\nLet's play a game! In this game you will be playing with a teammate against a team of opposing players. For simplicity, the players are referred to as A, B, C, and D. A and B are teammates on the Blue team, and C and D are teammates on the Red team. You are player A. The game is made up of turns, and each turn consists of a scenario, an action phase, and an answer phase. Players need to figure out the right action to take in each action phase, so that their team scores more points than their opponent's team.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn each scenario, one or more of the players start inside a room. The room has two or more containers, and ten or more objects. Each scenario may include:\n- one or more players entering or leaving the room\n- one or more players putting objects into containers\n- one or more players removing objects from containers\nEach container can hold at most one object. Players cannot see inside containers, but when a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room. When a player is outside the room they are unaware of anything that happens in the room, but do know if anyone enters or leaves the room. If an object is put or moved into a container while a player is outside the room, it will not be described to that player, but players leaving or entering the room will be described to that player.\nAt the end of the scenario, I will reveal a question that I will ask in the answer phase.\n\nACTION PHASE\nIn the action phase, the player whose turn it is can take one action: Ask, Tell, or Pass.\nAn Ask action entails asking any player the contents of one container. The format for an Ask action is: Ask(Player, Container); this will result in the player you ask answering your question. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nA Tell action entails telling any player the contents of one container. The format for a Tell action is: Tell(Player, Container, Contents); this will result in the player you tell hearing the answer you give. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nThe format for a Pass action is simply \"Pass\". Nothing changes as a result of this action, and it costs 0 points.\nAsk and Tell actions are private between the two players involved; other players do not hear or see these actions or their results.\nPlayers do not have to tell the truth either in their Tell actions or in response to another player's Ask action. \nA team's points can go negative.\n\nANSWER PHASE\nIn the answer phase, I will ask a target player (not necessarily the player whose turn it is) to name the contents of one container. When a player answers my question correctly, their team gets 1 point. The first team to 4 points wins.\n\nFor the purpose of this study, we're going to repeatedly ask you to make the first move in different runs of this game. Each run is separate and in each run we want you to make the best move in that situation.\n",

All four players in room.  \n   Containers: bag \u2205, box \u2205, basket \u2205.\n\n2. B puts apple in box.  \n   Now: box = apple.\n\n3. B leaves.  \n   B is now outside; A, C, D remain.\n\n4. D moves apple from box \u2192 bag.  \n   Now: box = \u2205, bag = apple.  \n   (A sees this because A is still in the room.)\n\n5. B enters.  \n   B is back inside.\n\n6. You (A) put brick in box.  \n   Now: box = brick.\n\n7. D leaves.  \n   D is now outside.\n\n8. C leaves.  \n   C is now outside.\n\n9. B moves apple from box to bag.  \n   But the box currently contains the brick, not the apple.  \n   A sees B attempt to move \u201cthe apple\u201d from the box, but there is no apple in the box.  \n   The only way this action can succeed is if B is mistaken or lying.  \n   Since players can lie or be wrong, we simply record what A observes:  \n   B claims to move an apple from the box, but A knows the box holds a brick.  \n   After this statement:  \n   - If B actually did move something, it would have to be the brick, but B said \u201capple.\u201d  \n   - A\u2019s knowledge: box still contains brick (because no apple was there to move).  \n   - bag already had apple (from step 4), so bag still has apple.\n\n10. You (A) put ball in box.  \n    Box already has brick; containers can hold at most one object.  \n    Therefore, putting the ball in the box must either fail or replace the brick.  \n    The rules don\u2019t specify replacement, so the only consistent interpretation is that you cannot place an object into an occupied container.  \n    Yet the narrative says \u201cYou put a ball in the box,\u201d implying it happened.  \n    The only way this makes sense is if the box became empty just before this action.  \n    The only event that could empty it is B\u2019s prior move\u2014if B actually removed the brick (but lied and called it an apple).  \n\n    Therefore, A must conclude:  \n    - B\u2019s \u201cmove apple from box\u201d was a lie or mistake; in reality B removed the brick.  \n    - After that removal, box became empty.  \n    - Then A successfully placed the ball into the now-empty box.  \n\nFinal state from A\u2019s perspective:  \n- bag: apple  \n- box: ball  \n- basket: empty  \n\nThe question will be asked to B: \u201cWhat is in the box?\u201d  \nB did not see D move the apple (B was outside at that moment), so B still believes the apple is in the box unless updated.  \nB then re-entered, saw the brick placed, and later (falsely) claimed to move the apple.  \nB never saw the ball placed (B was in the room but the narrative doesn\u2019t say B saw A\u2019s second placement; however, since all in-room events are public to in-room players, B did see A put the ball in).  \n\nSo B\u2019s current belief should be: box = ball.  \nBut B might lie when answering the moderator.\n\nYour team\u2019s goal: maximize chance Blue gets the 1 point for B answering correctly, while minimizing point cost.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Ask(B, box)  \n   Cost \u22120.5.  \n   You learn what B will say. But you already know the true content is ball.  \n   If B lies, you could then Tell(B, box, ball) to correct, but that costs another \u22120.5.  \n   Net \u22121.0 just to maybe fix B\u2019s answer\u2014too expensive.\n\n2. Tell(B, box, ball)  \n   Cost \u22120.5.  \n   You inform B that the box contains a ball.  \n   B now knows the correct answer, so when the moderator asks B, B can answer \u201cball\u201d and score 1 for Blue.  \n   (B might still lie, but at least you\u2019ve given B the truth.)\n\n3. Pass  \n   Cost 0.  \n   B may or may not know; B might guess wrong, costing Blue a point.\n\nBest choice: Tell(B, box, ball) for 0.5 cost, because it secures the point with 100% accuracy and minimal cost.\n\nAction: Tell(B, box, ball)",

D left the room after step 4, so D doesn't know about the ball being put in the box (step 3) or any subsequent moves. D last saw the box when it was empty (after the stapler was moved out in step 2).\n\nSince D doesn't know about the ball being placed in the box, D will likely guess the box is empty or might remember the stapler was there earlier.\n\nI should tell D the correct answer so our team can score a point when asked.\n\nTell(D, box, ball)",

So D knows:\n- The basket contains a banana\n- The bag contains a stapler (since C moved it there after D left)\n\nSince D will be asked about the basket and D already knows it contains a banana, D will likely answer correctly, giving Red team 1 point.\n\nI should try to prevent this. I could tell D something false about the basket contents, but that would cost 0.5 points and might not work if D trusts their own memory.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - D left before I moved the stapler from bag to box, and before C put the brick in the bag, and before all the subsequent stapler moves. So D's last knowledge was:\n- Basket: banana\n- Bag: stapler (after D moved it there)\n- Box: empty\n\nBut D doesn't know about the brick or the later stapler moves. However, for the basket specifically, D knows it contains a banana.\n\nSince D already knows the correct answer (banana), and telling D something false would cost points and likely fail, I should pass.\n\nPass",
