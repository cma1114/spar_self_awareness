My action: Pass'. Recording as invalid and will be scored as incorrect.

Action: Since I already know what's in the bag (nothing, because I put a brick in it initially and then it was moved to the box and then to the basket, and D put a ball in the bag, but then the brick was moved back to the box and then to the basket again, and the ball is the only object left in the bag), I can answer the question correctly in the answer phase. 

However, I can also use this opportunity to gain more information or potentially mislead the opposing team. Since I'm already certain of the answer, I'll choose to Pass, which costs 0 points and doesn't reveal any information to the opposing team.

My action: Pass
A answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Action: Ask(B, box)

I'm asking B about the box because B was the last Blue team member to see the box before C moved the brick and added the orange. B's knowledge of the box's contents is outdated, but it's still valuable information for me to know what B knows. This will help me understand what B will answer in the answer phase and potentially allow me to make a more informed decision in future turns.

Action: Ask(B, basket)

I'm choosing this action because I want to know the contents of the basket, which I can then use to my advantage in the answer phase. Since B is the one who moved the apple to the basket, they should know its contents. This action costs 0.5 points, but it could potentially give me valuable information that could help my team win.
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: Ask(C, box)

This action is chosen because C has left the room and does not know what happened after they left. By asking C what is in the box, we can determine if C will answer truthfully (i.e., that they don't know what's in the box) or if they will try to bluff. This information can be useful for future actions. Additionally, since C is going to be asked the same question in the answer phase, this action can help us understand C's strategy and potentially gain an advantage.

I'm choosing this action because C left the room before any objects were moved into the basket, so C has no information about the basket's contents. By asking C about the basket, I can potentially gain information about C's knowledge (or lack thereof) without giving away any information about the actual contents of the basket. This could be useful in future turns, especially since C will be answering a question about the bag's contents in the answer phase.

Invalid action: 'Since I'm outside the room and D is inside, I don't know what D knows about the basket. However, I do know that D was outside the room when I put the brick in the basket, so D doesn't know about the brick. 

If I Pass, D will answer the question based on their current knowledge, which might not be accurate. 

If I Ask(D, basket), D will tell me what they think is in the basket, but they might not know about the brick.

If I Tell(D, basket, brick), I will inform D about the brick, and D will answer the question correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

Considering the options, I think the best action is to Pass. This way, D will answer the question based on their current knowledge, which might not be accurate, and the Red team might not get a point.

My action: Pass'. Recording as invalid and will be scored as incorrect.

Given that I'm about to be asked a question, but it's actually C who will be asked the question, I think it's a good idea to try to influence C's answer. Since C wasn't in the room when B put the apple in the bag, C doesn't actually know what's in the bag.

I'll try to mislead C by telling them that the bag is empty. This might cause C to answer incorrectly, which would give us an advantage.
