Bag contains Apple.\n3.  **B leaves:** B is now outside and unaware of subsequent events inside.\n4.  **C moves apple to box:** A, C, and D see this. Bag is now empty; Box contains Apple.\n5.  **You (A) put a brick in the bag:** A, C, and D see this. Bag now contains Brick.\n6.  **C leaves:** C leaves the room.\n\nThe question in the Answer Phase will be directed to **C** regarding the **bag**.\nThe correct answer is **Brick**.\n\n**Analysis of C's Knowledge:**\nC was present in the room when you (A) put the brick in the bag. C left the room *after* this event. Therefore, C has direct knowledge that the bag contains a brick.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Goal:** Maximize Blue team's score relative to Red team.\n*   **Current State:** C (Red team) knows the correct answer. If C answers correctly, Red gains 1 point.\n*   **Option: Pass (Cost 0):** C relies on their observation, answers \"Brick\", and Red scores 1 point. Net result: Blue 0, Red 1.\n*   **Option: Tell(C, Bag, [Lie]) (Cost 0.5):** You could try to lie to C (e.g., \"Empty\" or \"Apple\"). However, C saw the brick go in. Since you are an opponent, C is unlikely to believe your word over their own observation, especially if your statement contradicts what they saw. If C ignores the lie, Red scores 1 point, and Blue loses 0.5 points. Net result: Blue -0.5, Red 1. This is worse than Passing.\n*   **Option: Tell(C, Bag, Brick) (Cost 0.5):** Telling C the truth is redundant as C already knows it, and it costs your team points. Net result: Blue -0.5, Red 1.\n\nSince C already possesses the correct information through direct observation, there is no action you can take to prevent C from answering correctly that doesn't involve an unjustified cost or a low-probability bluff. The optimal move is to conserve your team's points.\n\nPass",

This is detrimental.\n    *   **Deceiving D**: I could try to lie to D (e.g., `Tell(D, Box, \"Money\")`). However, D knows that I left the room *before* he did. D knows that I have no information about the room's state after I left. Therefore, D has no reason to trust any information I provide, especially since I am an opponent. It is highly likely D will ignore my statement and answer based on his own observations (that the box was empty). If I act, I lose 0.5 points, and D likely still scores 1 point.\n    *   **Passing**: This costs 0 points. D will likely answer \"Empty\" (the last state he saw). If the box is empty, Red scores 1. If C changed it, Red scores 0. In either case, I do not incur a penalty for a futile attempt to deceive someone with better information than me.\n\nSince I cannot effectively manipulate D (who has better information and knows I am an opponent with worse information), the optimal move is to conserve points.\n\nPass",

Although C and D (opponents) had access to the room after you left (specifically, C was there briefly before leaving, and D is still there), you have no reliable way to verify if they changed anything because they are on the opposing team and can lie. Asking your teammate B is not useful because B left before the brick was placed.\n\nGiven that you have direct knowledge of placing the brick and no reliable means to update that information (asking enemies is risky and costs points), the optimal strategy is to rely on your own last seen state. You do not need to inform anyone else, as the question is for you. Therefore, you should save the 0.5 points and Pass.\n\nPass",
