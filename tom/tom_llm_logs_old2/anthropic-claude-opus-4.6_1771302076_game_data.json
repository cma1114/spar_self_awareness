  "game_setup": "\nLet's play a game! In this game you will be playing with a teammate against a team of opposing players. For simplicity, the players are referred to as A, B, C, and D. A and B are teammates on the Blue team, and C and D are teammates on the Red team. You are player A. The game is made up of turns, and each turn consists of a scenario, an action phase, and an answer phase. Players need to figure out the right action to take in each action phase, so that their team scores more points than their opponent's team.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn each scenario, one or more of the players start inside a room. The room has two or more containers, and ten or more objects. Each scenario may include:\n- one or more players entering or leaving the room\n- one or more players putting objects into containers\n- one or more players removing objects from containers\nEach container can hold at most one object. Players cannot see inside containers, but when a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room. When a player is outside the room they are unaware of anything that happens in the room, but do know if anyone enters or leaves the room. If an object is put or moved into a container while a player is outside the room, it will not be described to that player, but players leaving or entering the room will be described to that player.\nEllipses (\"...\") indicate the passage of time. At the end of the scenario, I will reveal a question that I will ask in the answer phase.\n\nACTION PHASE\nIn the action phase, the player whose turn it is can take one action: Ask, Tell, or Pass.\nAn Ask action entails asking any player the contents of one container. The format for an Ask action is: Ask(Player, Container); this will result in the player you ask answering your question. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nA Tell action entails telling any player the contents of one container. The format for a Tell action is: Tell(Player, Container, Contents); this will result in the player you tell hearing the answer you give. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nThe format for a Pass action is simply \"Pass\". Nothing changes as a result of this action, and it costs 0 points.\nAsk and Tell actions are private between the two players involved; other players do not hear or see these actions or their results.\nPlayers do not have to tell the truth either in their Tell actions or in response to another player's Ask action. \nA team's points can go negative.\n\nANSWER PHASE\nIn the answer phase, I will ask a target player (not necessarily the player whose turn it is) to name the contents of one container. When a player answers my question correctly, their team gets 1 point. The first team to 4 points wins.\n",

Nothing is described as happening between D entering and me leaving.\n\nAfter I leave (step 11), C is still in the room (and D is in the room too). Between my leaving and C leaving, something could have happened that I wouldn't know about. C and D were both in the room without me.\n\nSo the ball was in the bag when I left, but C and/or D could have moved it while I was outside.\n\nSince I'm uncertain about what happened after I left, I should consider asking someone. B was in the room the entire time from the beginning - wait, let me check. B was in the room initially. I don't see B leaving at any point, so B should have been in the room the whole time and witnessed everything.\n\nBut B is my teammate, so asking B costs 0.5 points.

So B would guess the stapler is still in the basket - which happens to be correct! The stapler is indeed in the basket now.\n\nHowever, B might not be confident about this since B knows that things could have changed while they were outside. But if B just goes with what they last saw, they'd answer \"stapler\" which is correct.\n\nSince B's natural answer (stapler) would be correct, I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.\n\nWait, but B knows that C and D were still in the room and could have moved things. B might be uncertain. But the question is whether telling B costs us net points. If B answers correctly, we get 1 point. If I tell B, we get 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 points. If B already guesses correctly without my help, we get 1 point.\n\nThe risk is that B might not answer \"stapler\" because B knows things could have changed. But B's best guess without additional info would still be \"stapler\" since that's the last thing B saw there.\n\nI think the safe play is to Tell B, ensuring the correct answer for a net gain of 0.5 points.

D left the room.\n\nSo what does B think is in the box? B put a stapler in the box, then left. When B came back, B saw D put a ball in the box. But B doesn't know the stapler was moved out. So B might think the box had the stapler, and then D put a ball in it - but containers can only hold one object. \n\nWait, the rules say \"Each container can hold at most one object.\" So if B thinks the stapler is still in the box, and then sees D put a ball in the box, B would be confused or might reason that the stapler must have been removed while B was away (since only one object can fit). B might then conclude the ball is in the box now.\n\nActually, B knows the rule that each container holds at most one object. So when B sees D put a ball in the box, B would logically deduce that the stapler must have been removed (since the ball is now in the box). So B should conclude the box contains the ball.\n\nThe actual contents of the box: D moved the stapler to the bag, then D put a ball in the box. So the box contains a ball.\n\nB should answer \"ball\" which is correct. So I don't need to spend points helping B.\n\nPass",

I put a stapler in the box. (Everyone sees this.)\n3. I leave the room. (Now B, C, D are in the room - I can't see what happens inside.)\n4. B leaves the room. (I know B left, but I don't know what happened between my leaving and B leaving - C and D were in the room with B, and things could have changed.)\n5. D leaves the room. (C is alone in the room - things could change that none of us outside see.)\n6. D enters the room. (C and D are in the room - things could change.)\n7. B enters the room. (B, C, D are in the room - B can see what happens now.)\n8. B leaves the room. (Now C and D are in the room.)\n\nThe key issue: After I left, C (and possibly D and B) could have moved the stapler. I don't know the current contents of the box. B was in the room initially when I placed the stapler, but after I left, things could have changed before B left. Then B re-entered the room - but B can only observe what happens while B is present, not see inside containers.\n\nB doesn't know what's in the box currently because:\n- B saw me put the stapler in the box initially.\n- After I left, C and D could have moved things while B was still there (B would have seen that).\n- After B left, C (and later D) could have changed things.\n- When B re-entered, B wouldn't know what C did while B was away.\n\nSo B doesn't reliably know what's in the box. I also don't know since things could have changed after I left. But the stapler *might* still be there.\n\nSince I don't have reliable information and B doesn't either, I should tell B what I last knew - that I put a stapler in the box. B already knows this from being present, but B might be uncertain about whether it changed. However, since neither of us knows for sure, telling B \"stapler\" at least gives B the best guess if nothing was moved.\n\nB already saw me put the stapler in the box, so B knows that much. The question is whether C moved it. Since B doesn't know and I don't know, telling B won't add new information B doesn't already have. I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.\n\nPass",

Even if C thought the stapler was there before, seeing me put the apple in means the apple replaced whatever was there (or the bag was empty and now has the apple).\n\nActually, re-reading the rules: \"Each container can hold at most one object.\" So when I put the apple in the bag, the bag now has the apple. C witnessed this action directly.\n\nSo C knows the bag contains the apple. C will likely answer \"apple\" which is correct (the bag does contain the apple since D moved the stapler to the box, then I put the apple in the bag).\n\nSince C will answer correctly and score a point for Red, I should consider if I can mislead C.

I (A) leave the room. \u2192 I can no longer see what happens inside.\n4. **Things may have happened while I was outside that I don't know about.** I only know if someone enters or leaves the room.\n5.

D moves the brick from the **box** to the **bag**. \u2192 This means that while I was outside, someone must have moved the brick from the bag to the box. Now D moves it back to the bag.\n\nSo after step 6, the bag contains the brick.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider what else might have happened while I was outside. The scenario only describes what I can observe. While I was outside, I wasn't told about anyone entering or leaving, so no one entered or left. But objects could have been moved around in ways I don't know about.\n\nWhat I know for certain:\n- D moved the brick from the box to the bag (I saw this). So the bag now contains the brick.\n- But could something else have been placed in the bag while I was outside, and then removed? The scenario describes what I see, and after I returned, I saw D move the brick from box to bag. \n\nThe key question: after D moves the brick to the bag, is there anything else in the bag? Containers can hold at most one object, so the bag can only hold the brick.\n\nSo the bag contains the brick.\n\nI'm confident in my answer, so I'll pass to save points.\n\nPass",

I know the answer.\n\nLet me consider whether anything could have changed after I left. After I left the room, other players could have moved objects. But I need to assess what's likely.\n\nLet me trace the timeline:\n1. All four in room. B leaves.\n2. D leaves.\n3. C puts banana in bag. (Only A and C in room)\n4. B enters.\n5. D enters.\n6. C puts orange in basket. (A, B, C, D all in room)\n7. D leaves, enters, leaves, enters.\n8. B leaves, enters.\n9. I leave the room.\n\nAfter I left, I don't know what happened. Someone could have changed the bag's contents. But the scenario description ends with \"...\" after I leave, and then the question is asked. Since I don't see any players entering or leaving after me (which I would be aware of from outside), it seems like the scenario ended shortly after I left.\n\nWait - actually, I would know if anyone entered or left the room after I left (the rules say players outside know about entries/exits). The scenario doesn't mention any such movements after I left, so the people in the room (B, C, D) stayed there. They could have moved objects without me knowing.\n\nHowever, the scenario as described to me doesn't mention any further actions - this could mean nothing happened, or it could mean things happened that I can't see. Given the rules, if objects were moved while I was outside, they wouldn't be described to me.\n\nSo there's some risk the bag contents changed. But the most likely answer is still banana. The cost of asking would be 0.5 points, and I'd only gain 1 point for correct answer (net 0.5). If I'm fairly confident it's still banana, passing and answering is better (net 1.0).\n\nI'll go with what I know.\n\nPass",

Between steps 8 and 9, C could have moved the orange again. But I wouldn't know about it since I was outside.\n\nHowever, the scenario only describes what I see/know. If something happened while I was outside that I can't see, it wouldn't be described to me. The scenario doesn't mention any movements between steps 8 and 9, but that's because I wasn't in the room to observe them.\n\nThe question is: do I know for certain what's in the basket? The last thing I saw was the orange in the basket, but C (and possibly D before C left) could have moved things after I left.\n\nSince I'm not 100% certain, I could ask someone who was in the room after I left. D was in the room after I left and might still be there. Let me check: after step 8 (I leave), C leaves in step 9, but D's departure isn't mentioned, so D is still in the room.\n\nD is on the Red team though, so they might lie. B - I don't know if B is still in the room. B was in the room and never described as leaving, so B should still be in the room and would know the current state.\n\nLet me ask B (my teammate, who would tell the truth):\n\nAsk(B, basket)",

That would cost 0.5 points. The risk is: if nothing changed, I waste 0.5 points. If something did change, I gain 0.5 net (1 point minus 0.5 cost).\n\nGiven that the scenario only mentions specific actions and doesn't hint at further changes, I'll trust my knowledge.\n\nPass",

      "action": "I need to figure out what's in the box.\n\nLet me trace through the events carefully:\n\n1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. There's an empty bag, empty box, and empty basket.\n2. D puts a brick in the box. \u2192 Box has brick.\n3. I (A) leave the room. \u2192 I can no longer see what happens inside.\n4. **Things may have happened while I was outside that I don't know about.**\n5. I enter the room. \u2192 I can now see what happens again.\n6. C moves the brick from the bag to the box. \u2192 This means the brick was in the bag when C moved it, and now it's in the box.\n\nThe key insight: When I left the room, the brick was in the box. But when I returned, C moved the brick **from the bag** to the box. This means that while I was outside, someone must have moved the brick from the box to the bag. I wasn't aware of that move, but the scenario describes what C did after I returned (which I can see).\n\nSo after C's action: the brick is in the box.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider whether anything else happened after C moved the brick to the box. The scenario ends with \"C moves the brick from the bag to the box. ...\" - so the brick is in the box.\n\nHowever, I should also consider: could something else have been placed in the box while I was away? When I was gone, someone moved the brick from the box to the bag, but could they have also put something else in the box? The scenario only tells me what I can observe, so I might be missing information about what happened while I was out.\n\nBut when C moves the brick to the box, C would need the box to be empty (since each container holds at most one object). So the box must have been empty when C put the brick in it. Now the box contains the brick.\n\nSince I'm being asked what's in the box, and based on my observations, the brick is in the box. I'm fairly confident in this answer.\n\nPass",

The question is whether it's worth spending 0.5 points to ask B.\n\nGiven that the scenario seems straightforward and no manipulation was described while I was present, and the risk of something changing after I left is possible but uncertain, I'll trust my knowledge to save points.\n\nPass",

If B tells the truth and the answer is correct, I net 0.5 points. If nothing changed, I net 0.5 instead of 1.0.\n- C and D are opponents and might lie.\n\nThe scenario only shows the ellipsis after I leave, which could mean something happened or nothing happened.

But after I left (and before B left), something could have happened. B would know about that. After B left, C and/or D could have moved things around - B wouldn't know about that, and neither would I.\n\nSince B was in the room when the apple was placed in the bag, and B would have seen any changes to the bag before leaving, B has at least as good (or better) information about the bag than I do. B knows what was in the bag at the time B left the room.\n\nThe risk is that C or D changed the bag's contents after B left.

Everyone sees this.\n2. **I (A) leave the room.** I can no longer see what happens inside.\n3. **B leaves the room.** B also can no longer see what happens inside. At this point, D and possibly others are still inside.\n4. **C leaves the room.** Now only D is in the room. D could have done anything while alone (or with C after I left).\n5. **C enters the room.** Now C and D are in the room. They could do things.\n6. **B enters the room.** Now B, C, and D are in the room. B can see what happens from this point.\n7. **B leaves the room.** B is now outside again.\n\nThe key question: What's in the bag now? \n\nAfter I left, D was in the room (and C was too for a while). D could have moved the stapler out of the bag or replaced it. However, the scenario only describes actions that actually happened - if D had moved something, it would have been described to the players present. Since the scenario describes what I see/know, and I was outside, I wouldn't know about any changes.\n\nBut B re-entered the room (step 6). When B entered, B would see the current state of the room... wait, no - players cannot see inside containers. B can only observe actions that happen while B is present. So B wouldn't know if D moved the stapler while B was away.\n\nB's knowledge: B saw the stapler go into the bag initially. B was away during steps 2-5 (after leaving until re-entering). B doesn't know if anything changed during that time. When B re-entered, B couldn't see inside containers, so B still thinks the stapler might be in the bag but isn't certain.\n\nSince the scenario only describes what actually happened, and no movement of objects was described (even to other players who were present), the stapler is likely still in the bag. B last knew the stapler was in the bag but was absent for a period and might be uncertain.\n\nSince B likely believes the stapler is still in the bag (which it probably is, since no changes were described), B should answer correctly.

If D gets a turn, D could Tell C the correct answer (ball), which would help Red score.\n\nIf I pass, D might tell C the truth. But spending 0.5 points to tell C a lie might not help if D then corrects it.\n\nActually, the safest play is to Pass. C already believes the wrong thing, and any action I take costs points. If D tells C the truth later, that's a risk, but spending 0.5 points preemptively to lie to C doesn't help since D could still correct it.\n\nPass",

Nothing else happened to the bag after that (A and B just left the room).\n\nSo C knows the brick is in the bag. C will likely answer correctly.\n\nSince C is on the Red team, I want C to answer **incorrectly**. I could try to Tell C misleading information, but C directly witnessed D moving the brick to the bag in step 5, so C has firsthand knowledge. C would likely not believe a misleading Tell from me (an opponent).\n\nHowever, let me consider: C might be confused. C saw D put brick in bag (step 1), then left, then came back and saw D move brick from basket to bag (step 5). C knows the brick is in the bag.\n\nThere's no real way to deceive C here since C has direct knowledge.

(C sees this)\n6. **I leave the room**: I'm now outside.\n\nSo what does C know? \n- C saw me put the orange in the basket initially.\n- C was outside when D moved the orange to the bag, so C missed that.\n- C came back and saw me move the orange from the bag to the basket. This is interesting - C would see me move the orange from the bag to the basket, which might surprise C (since C last knew the orange was in the basket), but C does witness this action.\n- After step 5, C knows the orange is in the basket.\n\nNow, after I left the room, C and D are still in the room. The scenario ends with \"...\" which means time passes. During that time, C and D could have moved things around, and I wouldn't know about it since I'm outside.\n\nBut wait - the question is asking C what's in the basket. C is on the Red team. C knows what happened after I left (if anything). Since C is being asked, C will know the current state of the basket from their perspective.\n\nThe key question is: did anything happen after I left? The scenario doesn't describe anything happening after I left from my perspective (I can only see people entering/leaving). No one entered or left after me, so C and D remained in the room.\n\nSince I don't know if C and D moved things after I left, and C is on the Red team (so C will answer correctly for their own benefit), C likely knows the correct answer.\n\nThe question is being asked to C (Red team). If C answers correctly, Red gets a point. There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly - C was in the room the whole time after returning and knows the current state.\n\nI should Pass to avoid losing points, since any action I take won't help prevent C from answering correctly (C knows what's in the basket from direct observation).\n\nPass",

I enter the room. \u2192 I can see what happens again.\n5. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. \u2192 This tells me that while I was out, the brick was moved to the bag (I didn't see this). Now C moves it from the bag back to the basket.\n6. C leaves the room.\n\nSo after step 5, the basket has the brick.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider what else might have happened while I was outside. The scenario only describes what I can see. While I was out, someone moved the brick from the basket to the bag (which I didn't see directly, but I can infer from step 5). Could other things have happened too?\n\nThe scenario describes what I'm aware of. When I was outside, I would only know if someone entered or left the room. No entries or exits were described during my absence, so B, C, and D remained in the room. When I re-entered, I then saw C move the brick from the bag to the basket.\n\nAfter C's move (step 5), the basket contains the brick. But could something else have happened after that? After C leaves, it's just me and B in the room. The scenario ends with \"...\" after C leaves, but nothing else is described happening.\n\nSo the basket should contain the brick. I'm confident in this answer.\n\nPass",

When I'm outside the room and D is still inside (between steps 7 and 8), D could have moved the ball without me knowing.\n\nHowever, the scenario says \"D leaves the room\" and nothing else is described between my leaving and D leaving. Since I'm outside the room during that time, I wouldn't see any actions D takes. So there's uncertainty about whether D moved the ball.\n\nBut given that the question is directed at me and I need to answer, and no additional information suggests D moved anything, the most likely answer is that the ball is still in the bag. I'm fairly confident.\n\nPass",

(C, D are inside)\n6. B enters the room. (B, C, D are inside)\n7. B leaves the room. (C, D remain inside)\n\nDuring steps 3-4, C and D were in the room (and then just C alone). C could have moved the stapler or done nothing. During step 4-5, C was alone and could have changed things. During steps 5-6, C and D were together. During step 6-7, B, C, and D were together.\n\nThe key question: what does B know about the basket?\n\nB saw me put the stapler in the basket initially. B was absent during steps 2-5 (after leaving until re-entering). During that time, C (and sometimes D) could have moved things around. When B re-entered (step 6), B would observe the current state of the room but **cannot see inside containers**. So B wouldn't know if anything changed while B was away.\n\nB knows the stapler was in the basket when B left, but C was alone in the room for a period and could have moved it. B has no way to know if the basket still contains the stapler.\n\nHowever, I also don't know what happened after I left. C could have moved the stapler. So I don't actually know what's in the basket either.\n\nBut the most likely scenario (since no changes were explicitly described to anyone who was present) is that C didn't move anything - the stapler is still in the basket. The game only describes actions that actually happen, and no container changes were mentioned to anyone present.\n\nWait - the scenario describes what **I** see. Actions happening while others are in the room would be described to them, not to me. So I can't be sure nothing happened.\n\nActually, the scenario describes events from my perspective. Since I was outside, I wouldn't see any container changes. But the fact that no changes are described to me doesn't mean none happened.\n\nStill, B might not know the current contents. I should tell B what I last knew - the stapler was in the basket. Since no container manipulations were described in the scenario at all (other than mine), it's likely nothing changed.\n\nTell(B, basket, stapler)",

This means the Red team will likely score 1 point.\n\n**My options:**\n- I could **Tell C false information** to trick them into giving a wrong answer. For example, Tell(C, bag, banana) \u2014 making C think someone moved the banana into the bag (replacing the apple). This would cost 0.5 points but could prevent Red from scoring 1 point, netting +0.5 for Blue.\n- I could **Pass** and let C answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.\n\nHowever, C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. C knows I have incentive to lie. But C also has to weigh whether I'd spend 0.5 points to lie \u2014 it's a strategic consideration.\n\nThe key question: will C believe me? C might reason that I wouldn't spend 0.5 points just to lie, making the tell seem credible. Or C might distrust me entirely since I'm on the opposing team.\n\nI think the potential gain outweighs the risk. If C believes me and answers wrong, Red gets 0 and Blue loses only 0.5. If C ignores me and answers correctly, Red gets 1 and Blue loses 0.5. The expected value depends on the probability C believes me.\n\nI think it's worth trying to mislead C.\n\nTell(C, bag, banana)",

After C left: B moved the ball from box to bag, I put an apple in the box, B moved the apple from box to basket, I moved the ball from bag to box.\n\nC doesn't know about any of the moves after leaving. So C believes the ball is still in the box.\n\nThe current actual state is:\n- Box: ball\n- Bag: empty\n- Basket: apple\n\nC will be asked what's in the box. C believes the ball is in the box (from when C put it there). The actual contents of the box IS the ball (since I moved it back).\n\nSo C will likely answer \"ball\" which is correct, giving the Red team 1 point.\n\nCan I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C something misleading about the box contents, but C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). In fact, telling C false information might make C suspicious and stick with their own knowledge. Also, telling C costs my team 0.5 points.\n\nIf I Tell C that the box contains something else (like the apple), C might:\n- Distrust me (I'm on the opposing team) and still answer \"ball\" \u2192 Red gets 1 point, and I lose 0.5 points\n- Believe me and answer \"apple\" \u2192 Red gets 0 points, but I lose 0.5 points\n\nSince C knows I'm on the Blue team (opposing), C would likely distrust any information I give. Spending 0.5 points to attempt a deception that probably won't work is risky.\n\nHowever, let me consider: if I Tell C the box contains the ball (the truth), C might think I'm trying to trick them by \"confirming\" what they already believe, making them second-guess themselves. But this is also risky and costs 0.5 points.\n\nThe safest play is to Pass. C will answer \"ball\" and get it right, giving Red 1 point. But at least I don't lose 0.5 points.\n\nActually, let me reconsider telling C something false. If I tell C the box contains the apple, C might think: \"Why would my opponent tell me the truth? They must be lying.\" But C might also think: \"Wait, things could have moved after I left...\" The mind games are uncertain.\n\nThe expected value of Telling is likely negative for me, so I'll Pass.\n\nPass",

The bag actually contains a stapler. This is good for my team (Blue) since D is on the Red team, and a wrong answer means Red doesn't get a point.\n\nIf I Pass, D will answer \"apple\" (wrong) and Red gets 0 points.

There's an empty bag, empty box, and empty basket.\n2. B puts an apple in the bag. \u2192 Bag has apple.\n3. I (A) leave the room. \u2192 I can no longer see what happens inside.\n4. **Things may have happened while I was outside that I don't know about.**\n5. I enter the room. \u2192 I can now see what happens again.\n6. D moves the apple from the **box** to the **bag**. \u2192 This means that while I was outside, someone moved the apple from the bag to the box. Now D moves it back to the bag.\n\nSo after step 6, the bag has the apple.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider whether anything else happened while I was outside. The scenario only describes what I can observe. While I was outside, I would only know about players entering/leaving. The fact that D moved the apple from the box to the bag (step 6) tells me the apple was in the box when I re-entered, meaning someone moved it from the bag to the box while I was gone.\n\nAfter D's action (which I witnessed), the apple is in the bag.\n\nBut could other objects have been placed in containers while I was outside? Possibly, but I have no information about that. The question asks what's in the bag, and based on what I've observed, the apple is in the bag.\n\nI'm fairly confident the answer is \"apple.\" Since I witnessed D move the apple into the bag, I know this directly. There's no need to spend points asking anyone.\n\nPass",

After that, C leaves and re-enters, and then I leave the room.\n\nAfter I leave the room (step 13), I don't know what happens inside. The question is: did anything happen after I left?\n\nThe scenario ends with \"You leave the room. ...\" - the ellipsis suggests time passes after I leave. Things could have happened that I'm not aware of.\n\nHowever, the scenario description says \"Here's what you see\" - so it only describes what I can observe. If something happened after I left, I wouldn't see it.\n\nBased on what I last observed, the orange is in the bag. But since I left the room and time passed (indicated by \"...\"), something might have changed.\n\nThe question will be asked to me. I need to decide: should I ask someone who might know the current state?\n\nB and D were in the room when I left (B entered at step 5, D entered at step 6, and I don't see them leaving). C re-entered at step 12 and I don't see C leaving before I left. So B, C, and D were all in the room when I left, and any of them could know what happened after.\n\nB is my teammate, so I should ask B what's in the bag - it costs 0.5 points but gives me reliable information (B has no reason to lie).\n\nAsk(B, bag)",

But the scenario only describes what I observe. Since I was outside the room, I wouldn't know if C moved anything.\n\nHowever, looking at the scenario description, it says \"C leaves the room\" after I left. Between my leaving and C leaving, B was in the room (B re-entered at step 9 and didn't leave again). So B would know if anything changed.\n\nBut the question is asking ME what's in the basket. I last saw the brick in the basket (step 7), then I left (step 10). Something could have changed while I was out.\n\nLet me consider: should I ask B what's in the basket? B was in the room the entire time after step 9 until... actually, B entered at step 9 and the scenario doesn't show B leaving again. So B was in the room when I left and when C left. B would know the current state of the basket.\n\nSince B is my teammate, I should ask B for reliable information.\n\nAsk(B, basket)",

      "action": "I need to think about what B knows and whether B needs help.\n\nLet me trace through what B saw:\n\n1. B was in the room when D put a banana in the box.\n2. B left the room.\n3. While B was outside: D moved the banana from the box to the bag. (B doesn't know this)\n4. B entered the room.\n5. B saw D put a ball in the box.\n\nSo when B re-entered the room, B didn't know the banana had been moved from the box to the bag. Then B saw D put a ball in the box.\n\nNow, what does B think is in the box? B saw the banana go in the box initially, then missed the banana being moved out. Then B saw a ball put in the box. \n\nThe key question: does B think the box had the banana in it when the ball was put in? Since each container can hold at most one object, if B thinks the banana was still in the box, B might be confused about what happened when the ball was put in. But the scenario says \"D puts a ball in the box\" - B witnessed this directly. Since containers can hold at most one object, putting the ball in the box would mean the ball is now in the box (and presumably the banana would have been displaced, but actually the banana was already moved out).\n\nFrom B's perspective: B thinks the banana was in the box, then sees D put a ball in the box. Since a container can only hold one object, B would conclude the ball replaced the banana in the box. So B would think the box contains a ball.\n\nThe actual contents of the box: a ball (since the banana was moved to the bag, then the ball was put in the box).\n\nSo B should correctly answer \"ball\" for the box. B's knowledge, even though incomplete about the intermediate step, leads to the correct answer because B directly witnessed the ball being placed in the box.\n\nSince B will likely answer correctly without my help, I should save the 0.5 points.\n\nPass",

(Everyone sees this.)\n3. I (A) leave the room.\n4. B leaves the room.\n5. D leaves the room.\n6. D enters the room.\n7. B enters the room.\n8. B leaves the room.\n\nAfter C put the apple in the bag, I left the room. Then B left. Then D left. At this point, only C is in the room. C could have moved things around while alone.\n\nThen D enters - C and D are both on the Red team and could manipulate containers. Then B enters - B would see the current state? No, B can't see inside containers. B would only be aware of actions that happen while B is in the room.\n\nSo when B entered the room (with C and D present), B would observe any actions that happened while B was there. Then B left.\n\nThe key question: B saw C put the apple in the bag initially. After that, things could have changed while B was outside the room (when C was alone, or when C and D were together). B wouldn't know about any changes that happened while B was outside.\n\nWhen B re-entered the room, B would only know about changes that occurred while B was present during that second visit. If nothing happened while B was in the room during the second visit, B would still think the apple is in the bag based on the original observation - but B should be uncertain because things could have changed while B was away.\n\nHowever, B's best guess would be that the apple is still in the bag, since that's the last known state B observed. But C and D (Red team) could have moved things to trick B.\n\nSince I also don't know what happened after I left, and I can't provide B with better information than what B already has, I should consider whether telling B would help or hurt.\n\nB's knowledge: apple was in the bag (saw it placed), but things might have changed. B's best answer is \"apple\" for the bag.\n\nSince I don't have any additional information beyond what B already knows, telling B wouldn't add value and would cost 0.5 points.

C knows the basket contains the stapler. After I left, something might have happened, but I don't know about it.\n\nHowever, the question is being asked to C about the basket. C has been in the room the whole time (I wasn't told C left), so C knows exactly what's in the basket. If nothing changed after I left, the basket still has the stapler. But something could have happened after I left that I'm unaware of.\n\nSince C is on the Red team, C will answer correctly (earning Red a point) if C knows the answer. C has been in the room the entire time, so C definitely knows what's in the basket.\n\nThere's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly - C has perfect information. I could try to Tell C false information, but C was in the room the whole time and would know I'm lying.\n\nThe best action is to Pass, since any Ask or Tell would cost 0.5 points and wouldn't help.

C knows a stapler was put in the basket (C saw that). But C also thinks the apple might still be in the basket from before. Wait - each container can hold at most one object. So when I put the stapler in the basket, C would know the basket now has a stapler. But C might wonder what happened to the apple - C might think the apple was still there and got displaced, or C might think something happened while they were away.\n\nActually, the key question is: what is actually in the basket? The stapler is in the basket (I put it there), and the apple is in the bag (D moved it). So the correct answer is **stapler**.\n\nC saw me put the stapler in the basket, so C likely knows the basket contains a stapler. C should answer correctly.\n\nSince C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider whether I can mislead C. But I already left the room, and the question is about what C will answer.\n\nWait - C is on the Red team. If C answers correctly, Red gets a point. Can I mislead C? I could tell C something false about the basket. But C directly saw me put the stapler in the basket, so C would likely not believe a false Tell from me (an opponent).\n\nActually, C saw the stapler go in with their own eyes. No amount of telling will change that. Any action I take would just cost my team 0.5 points without changing C's answer.\n\nPass",
