Since I will be asked about the basket and I already know the correct answer, I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell anything. I simply Pass.

Action: I know the basket’s contents changed while D was outside, so only B and I saw the banana go in.  
Since the upcoming question is “What is in the basket?”, the safest way to lock in the right answer for our team is to verify with B (who also saw the banana placed) rather than risk a 1-point loss if I mis-remember.

Action: I know the bag now contains a banana because I was in the room when D put it there.  
Since the upcoming question will be “What is in the bag?”, the safest way to guarantee our team the +1 point is to make sure I (A) am the one who gets asked.  
I therefore tell myself the contents of the bag:

Since the upcoming question will be directed at me and I already know the correct answer, I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell anything.

Action: I know the basket currently contains the ball, because I saw D move it back there and no one has moved it since.  
Since the upcoming question will be “What is in the basket?”, I can guarantee our team the +1 point by simply telling my teammate B the correct answer now; the 0.5-point cost is easily outweighed by the +1 we’ll earn.

Action: I need to think through what B knows and what the true state is.

True final state (what I saw):
- Basket: stapler (C moved it back from bag → basket)
- Box: apple (D moved it there from basket)
- Bag: empty

But B left the room right after I put the stapler in the basket, so B never saw:
- D move stapler basket→bag
- C put apple in basket
- D move apple basket→box
- C move stapler bag→basket

Therefore, from B’s perspective, the last thing B saw was:
- Basket: stapler
- Box: empty
- Bag: empty

So B currently believes the basket still contains the stapler.

The upcoming question is to B: “What is in the basket?”  
If B answers based on what B last saw, B will say “stapler” — which is actually correct right now.

If B answers correctly, Blue gains 1 point.  
If B answers incorrectly, Blue loses 1 point.

I want to avoid any risk that B might be misled before answering.  
The only way B could be misled is if someone tells B something false.  
But B is out of the room now, and only D is also out; C and I are still in.  
No one else can tell B anything unless they re-enter.

Since B already has the correct belief (stapler in basket), and any Ask/Tell costs 0.5 and could only introduce doubt or misinformation, the best action is to Pass and let B answer from current knowledge.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

- Bag: empty
- Basket: ball (D put it there)

B left the room right after placing the brick in the box and never returned, so B still believes the brick is in the box.  
The question will be put to B, and if B answers “brick” (what B believes), B will be correct and Blue will gain 1 point.

Action: I know the current contents of every container:

- Bag: orange (D put it there while C and I were still in the room)
- Box: banana (D moved it there from the basket, then I moved it back to the basket, then D moved it back to the box)
- Basket: empty (after D moved the banana out)

B did not see any of these later moves because B left the room right after putting the banana in the bag.  
Therefore, if I do nothing, B will likely answer “banana” (the last thing B knew was in the bag) and lose 1 point for Blue.

I can prevent that loss by privately telling B the truth now.

Rationale:  
- The upcoming question is “What is in the box?” and it will be asked of B.  
- B left the room before C put the banana in the box, so B still believes the box contains the original ball.  
- If B answers “ball,” Blue loses 1 point.

Action: I see that B just put an apple in the bag, and I’m about to be asked what’s in the bag.  
Since I already know the correct answer (apple), the safest, cheapest move is to do nothing and simply wait to answer correctly in the Answer Phase.

Action: I know the basket currently contains the stapler (B put it there and no one has touched it since).  
The upcoming question is to B about the basket.  
If B answers correctly, Blue gains 1 point; if B is wrong, Blue loses 1 point.  
I can guarantee B answers correctly by telling B the truth now, costing only 0.5 points—cheaper than risking a wrong answer (−1) and still netting +0.5 overall.

Tell(B, basket, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I know the box contains the stapler (I put it there), and the question will be asked of B, who was out of the room when I placed it and has never been back in while any other player was inside to have told him.  
Since B has no way to know the true contents, I can guarantee he gets the question wrong (–1 for Blue) unless I tell him the truth.  
Telling B the correct contents costs only 0.5 and turns the upcoming answer into +1 for us, a net +0.5 swing.

Action: I know the bag currently contains the apple (I put it there and no one has touched it since).  
C was outside when both the apple went in and when every later move happened, so C has no direct information about any container.  
If I do nothing, C will have to guess blindly when the question comes, giving us a 50 % shot at +1 (if C is wrong) or –1 (if C is right).  
By spending 0.5 pt to tell C the correct contents, I guarantee C answers correctly, so Red scores +1 instead of the random outcome.  
That swap (–0.5 for sure instead of –1 with 50 % chance) is favourable for Blue.

Action: I know the true sequence of events, so I can work out the current contents of every container.

- Banana: ended in the basket  
- Ball: ended back in the box  

Therefore the box now contains the ball.

Since the upcoming question will be put to D, and D was outside the room during the last three moves (after D left), D never saw those final relocations. If D answers based only on what D actually witnessed, D will wrongly think the box still holds the banana. By telling D the correct fact now, I give my teammate the chance to answer correctly and earn us 1 point, at a cost of only 0.5.

Tell(D, box, ball)
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- Bag: orange (D placed it there after C had left)
- Box: stapler (B moved it from the bag while C was out)
- Basket: empty

C was outside when both of these changes happened, so C currently believes the bag holds the stapler and has no idea about the orange.

You are about to ask C what is in the bag.  
If C answers “stapler” (what C believes), that answer will be scored wrong (losing 1 pt for Blue).  
If I can get C to update to the truth, C will answer “orange” and Blue gains 1 pt.

The cheapest way to do that is to tell C the correct contents.

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- Basket: apple (D placed it there after moving the brick out)
- Bag: empty (I last moved the brick to the box)
- Box: brick (my last move)

C is about to be asked “What is in the basket?”  
C was not in the room when D put the apple in the basket, so C has no way to know the basket now holds an apple.  
If I do nothing, C will guess randomly and will probably be wrong, costing Red 1 point – exactly what I want.

Therefore the best action is:

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- Bag: stapler  
- Box: empty  
- Basket: orange  

The question will be “What is in the basket?” and D will be asked.  
D saw everything that happened while he stayed in the room, so he already knows the basket now holds the orange.  
Therefore, D will almost certainly answer “orange” and earn 1 point for Red.

I can’t improve Blue’s score by any Ask/Tell (they cost 0.5 and can’t change D’s knowledge), and Pass costs 0.  
Hence the best action is simply to pass.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Since the upcoming question will be “What is in the box?” and I will be the one asked, I don’t need to pay 0.5 points to learn or share anything; I already have the correct answer ready for the answer phase.

Since the upcoming question is “What is in the basket?” and B already believes (correctly) that it contains a banana, B will answer correctly and Blue will gain 1 point.  
Nothing I can tell or ask will improve that outcome, and any Ask/Tell would cost us 0.5 points.

Pass.
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------

I am going to ask B what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I need to decide what action to take in the action phase. The goal is to help my team (Blue) score more points than the Red team.

Let’s first **recap the scenario** from my perspective (as player A):

- All four players (A, B, C, D) start in the room.
- There are three containers: bag, box, basket — all initially empty.
- I (A) put a banana in the box.
- Then B leaves the room.
- While B is outside, D moves the banana from the box to the bag.
- C puts an apple in the box.
- D moves the apple from the box to the basket.
- C moves the banana from the bag to the box.

So, final state of containers:
- **Box**: banana (last moved there by C)
- **Bag**: empty
- **Basket**: apple (moved there by D)

Now, the **question** is: *I am going to ask B what is in the box.*

But B **left the room before** any of the later moves happened. Specifically:
- B left **after** I put the banana in the box.
- So B **saw** the banana go into the box.
- But B **did not see**:
  - D move the banana to the bag
  - C put the apple in the box
  - D move the apple to the basket
  - C move the banana back to the box

So from B’s perspective:
- B saw: banana in box
- Then B left
- B has **no knowledge** of any subsequent moves

Therefore, **B believes the banana is still in the box**, because that’s the last thing B saw.

But **in reality**, the banana is **currently in the box** (after being moved back by C), so **B’s belief is correct**, even though B doesn’t know about the intermediate steps.

So if I do **nothing**, and the question is asked to B: “What is in the box?”, B will likely say **banana**, which is **correct**, so **Blue team gains 1 point**.

But wait — **I am on the Blue team with B**. So if B answers correctly, **we get +1 point**.

But I have an action now. What can I do?

Options:
- **Ask(Player, Container)**: e.g., ask someone what’s in a container. Costs 0.5 points.
- **Tell(Player, Container, Contents)**: tell someone what’s in a container. Costs 0.5 points.
- **Pass**: do nothing. Costs 0.

But **I already know the current state**:
- Box: banana
- Bag: empty
- Basket: apple

And **B is about to be asked** what is in the box.

B **currently believes** the banana is in the box — and **that belief is correct**, even if outdated in reasoning.

So **B will likely answer “banana”**, and **be correct**, earning **+1 for Blue**.

But **could B be uncertain?** No — B has no reason to doubt. From B’s perspective, no one touched the box after B left, so B assumes the banana is still there.

So **B will answer correctly**, unless **someone misleads B** before the question.

But **I am the only one who can act now** — it’s **my turn** in the action phase, **before** the answer phase.

So **no one else can interfere** after me.

Therefore, **if I do nothing (Pass)**, B will be asked, and **will say “banana”**, which is **correct**, so **Blue gets +1**.

But what if I **Tell B** something?

Suppose I **Tell(B, box, banana)** — that would cost 0.5 points, and **confirm** what B already believes.

But **B already believes it** — so this is **redundant**, and **costs us 0.5 points**, reducing our net gain from +1 to **+0.5** — **worse**.

What if I **Tell(B, box, apple)**? That would be **lying**, and **misleading B**, causing B to **answer incorrectly**, so **Blue loses 1 point** — **disastrous**.

Similarly, **asking** anyone anything costs 0.5 and gives **no benefit** — I already know the truth, and B’s belief is correct.

So **any action I take either hurts us or is wasteful**.

Therefore, **best action is to Pass** — **preserve the +1 point** we’re about to earn.

> ✅ **B will answer “banana”**, which is **correct**, so **Blue gets +1** — **if I don’t interfere**.

**Action: Pass**
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

B left before any of those moves, so B still believes the box holds the apple.

Action: I know the true sequence of events, so I can work out the final state:

- Bag: stapler  
- Box: orange  
- Basket: empty  

B was present for the first move (orange → bag) but left before any later reshuffling, so B still believes the orange is in the bag.  
The upcoming question is to B: “What is in the bag?”  
If B answers with the orange (as B currently believes), B will be wrong and Blue loses 1 point.

I can prevent that by correcting B’s belief.  
The cheapest way is to tell B the truth about the bag for 0.5 points.

Action: I know the stapler is currently in the box (D moved it there after C left).  
B was outside when C moved it from box → bag and when D moved it back bag → box, so B never saw those two moves.  
Therefore B might wrongly think the stapler is still in the bag.

Since the upcoming question is to B about the box, I can guarantee B answers correctly (and we score +1) by simply telling B the truth.

Tell(B, box, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I know the box currently contains an apple (C put it there and no one has touched it since).  
B was out of the room the whole time, so B has no way to know this.  
If I do nothing, B will be forced to guess when the question comes, and a wrong answer costs us 1 point.  
For 0.5 points I can guarantee B answers correctly.

Action: I want to minimize the information C has about the bag, because the question will be asked to C and I’d like C to answer incorrectly.  
C was outside the room when the stapler was placed in the bag, so C has no way to know the bag now holds the stapler.  
If I do nothing, C will have to guess and will likely be wrong, costing Red 1 point.  
Any Ask or Tell costs us 0.5 and could only help C.  
Therefore the best action is:

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I know the true sequence of events, so I can work out the final state:

- Box: ball (last object D put there, never moved out)
- Bag: empty (apple was moved out to basket, never returned)
- Basket: apple (last moved there by D, never moved out)

The question will be “What is in the box?” and C will be asked.

If C answers “ball”, Red gains 1 point; if C answers anything else, Red loses 1 point.  
I want to minimize Red’s chance of getting that point.

I cannot change the actual contents, and any Ask/Tell costs 0.5.  
The only thing I can do is try to mislead C before the question is asked.

Best cheap move: privately tell C the wrong contents so C might repeat the lie and lose the point.

Action: I know the box currently contains the ball (D put it there and no one has removed it).  
C was present the whole time, so C also knows the box contains the ball.  
Since the upcoming question is “What is in the box?” and C already has the correct answer, I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to Tell C anything, and asking C would just confirm what I already know.  
Therefore the optimal action is to save the points.

Action: I know the true sequence of events, so I can work out where every object is right now.

Final state after the last “… B leaves the room.”  
- I (A) am outside.  
- B is outside.  
- C is inside.  
- D is inside.  

Containers:  
- bag: ball (the stapler was moved out long ago)  
- box: stapler  
- basket: empty  

The upcoming question will be to C: “What is in the bag?”  
C did not see the last three moves (the two B-exits and the final D-moves) because C was already inside and those moves don’t change what C observes.  
From C’s point of view the bag could still contain either the stapler or the ball; C has no way to be sure.

If C answers “ball” (the truth), Blue gains 1 pt.  
If C answers anything else, Blue loses 1 pt.

I cannot improve on that expected value, and any Ask/Tell costs 0.5 pt.

Pass.
C answers: ball

Action: I need to figure out what is in the basket, because I will be asked that in the answer phase.

Let me trace the sequence:

1. D puts a ball in the basket.  
   → basket: ball

2. D leaves the room.  
   → D is now outside, but we’re still inside, so we see everything.

3. I move the ball from the basket to the bag.  
   → basket: empty, bag: ball

4. C puts a brick in the basket.  
   → basket: brick

5. C moves the ball from the bag to the box.  
   → bag: empty, box: ball

6. I move the ball from the box to the bag.  
   → box: empty, bag: ball

7. B moves the ball from the bag to the box.  
   → bag: empty, box: ball

So at the end:
- basket: brick
- box: ball
- bag: empty

I know the basket contains a brick. I don’t need to ask or tell anyone — I already know the answer to the upcoming question.

Taking any Ask or Tell action costs 0.5 points and gives no benefit here, since I already know what’s in the basket.

Best action: **Pass**

Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

ACTION PHASE

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None

Action: Let me walk through the timeline carefully.

1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.  
   Containers: bag (empty), box (empty), basket (empty).

2. D puts a brick in the box.  
   Now: box = brick, bag = empty, basket = empty.  
   Everyone in the room (A, B, C, D) sees this.

3. “...” (time passes, nothing said to happen).

4. You (A) leave the room.  
   Now only B, C, D remain inside.  
   From this point on, you (A) are unaware of anything that happens inside.

5. “...” (time passes while you are outside).

6. You (A) enter the room again.  
   Now all four are back inside.

7. “C moves the brick from the bag to the box.”  
   But wait: when you left, the brick was in the box, and the bag was empty.  
   While you were outside, you have no information about what occurred.  
   The narrative now says C moves the brick “from the bag to the box.”  
   That implies that, at some point while you were outside, the brick must have been moved from the box into the bag (otherwise C couldn’t move it “from the bag”).  
   However, you did not observe that intermediate step.  
   The only thing you directly observe after re-entering is this final statement: C moves the brick from the bag to the box.

Therefore, as far as you currently know:

- The last place you saw the brick was in the box (step 2).  
- While you were outside, unknown things happened: apparently someone moved the brick from box → bag (you didn’t see), then C just now moved it bag → box (you do see).  
- So after that last move, the brick is back in the box.

Hence, right now the box contains the brick.

Since the upcoming question is “What is in the box?” and you already know it’s the brick (you just saw C put it there), you don’t need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell anything. Passing keeps your score at 0 and changes nothing.

Action: Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag to answer the upcoming question correctly. Since I was outside the room when B left, and I don't know what happened after that, I should ask someone who might still be in the room or who has more recent information.

However, the last thing I saw was:
- D moved the stapler from the bag to the basket.
- Then C moved it back from the basket to the bag.
- Then I left.
- Then B left.

So at the point I left, the stapler was in the bag. But I don’t know what happened after B left — maybe someone else entered or moved things.

Since I need to know the current contents of the bag and I’m not sure if anything changed after I left, I should ask someone who might still be in the room or who has more recent info.

But I don’t know who is still in the room now — the scenario ends with B leaving, and it doesn’t say who is still inside.

So I need to ask someone who was last in the room: either B, C, or D.

I’ll ask **B**, since they were in the room until the end and might know the final state.

**Ask(B, bag)**
A answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

Action: I know the correct answer to the upcoming question: the box contains the stapler.  
Since I will not be the one questioned, the only way to help my team is to make sure B (who will be asked) also knows the truth.  
The cheapest, risk-free way to do that is to tell B the correct contents.

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a brick in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... B leaves the room. ...

Action: I need to think through what just happened and what B currently believes.

Timeline of who saw what:

1. All four of us are in the room.  
   - B puts the brick in the box.  
   → Everyone sees: box = brick.

2. D leaves.  
   → B and I are still in, so we see D leave; C also stays, so C sees it too.

3. B leaves.  
   → Only C and I are left in the room; B is now outside and will NOT see anything that happens next.

4. C (with me watching) moves brick from box → bag.  
   → C and I see: box now empty, bag = brick.  
   → B (outside) sees none of this.

5. C puts stapler in box.  
   → C and I see: box = stapler.

6. C moves stapler from box → basket.  
   → C and I see: box empty, basket = stapler.

7. C moves brick from bag → box.  
   → C and I see: box = brick, bag empty, basket = stapler.

So right now:
- Box: brick  
- Bag: empty  
- Basket: stapler  

B, however, left the room right after step 1 and has seen nothing since.  
Therefore B still believes: box = brick (and has no info on bag/basket).  
That belief happens to be TRUE, so if I simply keep quiet, B will answer “brick” and score +1 for Blue.

Any Ask or Tell costs us 0.5 and risks alerting Red players; Pass costs 0 and changes nothing.  
Since B’s current (uncertain) belief is actually correct, the safest, highest-EV action is to Pass.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I know the current state of every container because I was in the room the whole time and saw every move:

- Basket: banana (B put it there, and no one has touched the basket since)  
- Bag: empty (I saw C move the orange out of it to the box, and no one has put anything back)  
- Box: orange (C moved it there last)

The upcoming question is to B: “What is in the basket?”  
B left the room before the last three moves, so B still believes the basket contains the orange he originally placed there.  
If B answers “orange,” Blue loses 1 point.

I can prevent that loss by privately correcting B’s belief.  
The cheapest way is a single Tell action: Tell(B, basket, banana) costs 0.5 points, but saves us the 1-point penalty, netting +0.5 for Blue.

Action: I need to think through what B knows and what the correct state of the bag is.

Let me trace the sequence of events from B's perspective:

1. Initially: bag, box, basket all empty
2. D puts apple in bag → B sees this
3. B leaves the room → B no longer sees anything that happens inside
4. D moves apple from bag to box → B doesn't see this
5. D puts ball in bag → B doesn't see this
6. C leaves → B doesn't see this
7. D moves apple from box to basket → B doesn't see this
8. I move apple from basket to box → B doesn't see this

So from B's perspective:
- B saw D put an apple in the bag
- B left, so B is unaware of all subsequent moves
- Therefore, B currently believes the apple is still in the bag

But the actual current state is:
- Apple is in the box (after my last move)
- Ball is in the bag

Since I will be asked what is in the bag, and I know the ball is in the bag, I want to make sure B answers correctly to help our team score.

However, I cannot directly tell B the correct answer because that would cost 0.5 points, and B might not believe me anyway since players can lie.

Instead, I should ask B what they think is in the bag to understand their current belief, which might help me decide future actions.

Ask(B, bag)
B answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- Box: ball  
- Bag: empty  
- Basket: apple  

B left before any of the later moves happened, so B’s last knowledge is:

- Box: apple (the very first move)  
- Bag & basket: empty  

C and D both left even earlier, so they share that same outdated picture.

The upcoming question is going to B: “What is in the box?”  
If B answers with the stale “apple”, Blue loses 1 point; if B somehow says “ball”, Blue gains 1 point.

I can’t speak to B directly during the answer phase, but right now I can send B a free, private Tell to update him.

Action: I need to think through what B knows and what the true state is.

**What B knows:**
- B was in the room when I put the banana in the bag
- B left the room after that
- B has no knowledge of any subsequent moves (C moving banana from bag to basket, D moving it back to bag, D leaving, C moving banana from bag to box, C putting ball in bag)

**Current true state (what I know):**
- Banana is in the box
- Ball is in the bag

**What B thinks:**
- B believes banana is still in the bag (since that's where I put it and B left before any moves happened)

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the bag, and B will likely say "banana" based on what B knows.

However, the correct answer is "ball" (since C put a ball in the bag after moving the banana to the box).

**My options:**
- Ask: Would cost 0.5 points and might give me info, but I already know the true state
- Tell: I could tell B the correct information, but it costs 0.5 points
- Pass: Costs nothing

Since I already know the true state and B is about to be asked, I should tell B the correct answer so B can answer correctly and get us 1 point. The 0.5 point cost is worth it to gain 1 point.

Tell(B, bag, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

B was present when you (A) put the apple in the box, so B already knows the box contains the apple.  
By telling B something B already knows, you spend 0.5 points but risk nothing: B cannot be misled, and you ensure B will answer the upcoming question correctly, earning Blue team +1 point.  
Net expected gain: +0.5 points versus passing (0).
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I’m about to be asked what is in the bag, but I don’t know for sure—B put the apple in while I was still in the room, but then I left and B left, so I have no later information.  
Since the question will be put to B, not to me, the cheapest safe move is simply to pass and let B answer (or lie) without spending any points.

Action: I know the bag currently contains the stapler (I put it there).  
C left before any further moves, so C has no way to know what, if anything, is now in the bag.  
If I do nothing, C will be forced to guess when questioned and will very likely guess “empty,” losing a point for Red.  

Therefore the safest, cheapest action is:

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an apple in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the apple from the basket to the bag. ... D puts a stapler in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... You move the apple from the bag to the box. ... D moves the apple from the box to the bag. ... You move the apple from the bag to the box. ...

ACTION PHASE

Action: I know the current state of every container:

- basket: stapler  
- bag: empty  
- box: apple  

C is outside the room and has not seen any of the moves that happened after he left (i.e., every move after “C leaves the room”).  
Therefore C has no way to know that:
- the apple ever left the basket,  
- the stapler was ever placed,  
- or that any later shuffles occurred.

If I do nothing, when the moderator asks C “What is in the basket?”, C will still believe it contains the apple (the last thing he saw).  
Answering “apple” will be wrong, so Red will lose 1 point – exactly what I want.

Any Ask or Tell would cost us 0.5 points and could only help Red update their belief.  
Hence the optimal action is simply to pass.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I know the true sequence of events, so I can work out exactly where every object is right now.

Final state:
- basket: stapler (D put it there and it was never moved)
- box: apple (D moved it there last)
- bag: empty

The upcoming question is: “What is in the basket?”  
C is outside the room and has no information about any of the moves that happened after he left, so he currently believes the basket still holds the apple (the only thing he ever saw placed).  
If C answers “apple” he will be wrong and Red loses 1 point; if he somehow answers “stapler” he will be right and Red gains 1 point.

Because I want Blue to win, I prefer that C answers incorrectly.  
The cheapest way to make that happen is to leave C’s belief unchanged.  
Therefore I do nothing.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: Tell(D, basket, banana)

Explanation:  
- The upcoming question will be asked to D about the basket.  
- D left the room before you ever touched the basket, so D has no way to know you placed a banana there.  
- By privately telling D the correct contents now, we make it likely D will answer correctly in the answer phase, earning Blue +1 point.  
- The 0.5-point cost is acceptable because it sets up a high-probability +1 gain.
D answers: banana

Action: I know the current state of the room:

- Basket: ball  
- Box: stapler  
- Bag: empty  

D left before any of the later moves happened, so D has no knowledge of any object movements after that point.  
I will be asked what is in the basket, and if D answers incorrectly, Red loses 1 point.

Since D is on the opposing (Red) team, I want D to answer incorrectly.  
The best way to make that happen is to leave D in the dark—give D no new information—so D will probably guess “ball” (the last thing D saw) and be wrong.

Therefore I simply pass.

Action: I know the box contains an orange (I saw D place it there before I left).  
C is still in the room and might not be sure what’s in the box (he didn’t see anyone check it after the orange was placed).  
If I simply let the upcoming question to C stand, C might guess wrong and Red would lose a point—good for us, but risky because C might actually guess correctly and Red would gain a point.

Instead, I can guarantee Red loses that point by telling C the correct contents right now.  
Cost is only 0.5, and it turns the upcoming question into a sure -1 for Red, swinging the net score by +1.5 for Blue (we avoid the possible +1 for Red and instead give them -1, while we pay only 0.5).

Action: Tell(C, box, orange)
C answers: orange

Action: I know the box contains an orange (I saw D put it there).  
C is still in the room, so C may or may not have noticed that fact.  
The upcoming question will be asked to C about the box.  
If C answers “orange,” Red gains 1 pt; if C answers wrongly, Red loses 1 pt.

I can’t improve Blue’s score directly on this turn, but I can try to make Red lose 1 pt by feeding C false information so C answers wrong.

Since the upcoming question will be “What is in the box?”, I can guarantee my team 1 point by simply telling B the correct contents now; the 0.5-point cost is easily offset by the 1-point gain.

Action: I notice a contradiction in the scenario description:

- First it says “C puts a ball in the basket.”  
- Later it says “C moves the ball from the bag to the basket.”  

But the bag was never mentioned as having the ball; the ball was put in the basket, not the bag.  
Since I was outside the room when that second move supposedly happened, I did not see it, and the description I received is internally inconsistent.

Because I cannot trust that description, I do not have reliable information about the basket’s current contents.  
The only way to get certainty is to ask the player who was present the whole time.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I need to figure out what is in the basket at the end of the scenario.

Let me trace the sequence of events:

1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room. Containers: bag, box, basket — all empty.
2. B leaves.
3. C leaves.
4. I (A) put a brick in the basket → basket now has brick.
5. B enters.
6. C enters.
7. I leave.
8. I enter.
9. C moves the brick from the basket to the bag → basket empty, bag has brick.
10. D moves the brick from the bag to the basket → bag empty, basket has brick.
11. C leaves.
12. C enters.
13. I leave.

So at the end, the basket contains the brick.

But I need to confirm this because I was outside the room during steps 9 and 10 — when C and D moved the brick. However, I re-entered the room at step 8, so I was present for steps 9 and 10. Then I left again at step 13.

Wait — step 7: I leave.  
Step 8: I enter.  
So I was outside during step 7, but re-entered before step 9. So I **was** in the room when C moved the brick from basket to bag (step 9), and when D moved it from bag to basket (step 10). Then I left again at step 13.

So I **saw** both moves. I know the brick ended up in the basket.

Therefore, I know the basket contains the brick.

Now, the question in the answer phase will be: “What is in the basket?”  
And I will be asked this — but I don’t know **who** will be asked. It could be me, or B, or C, or D.

But since I know the correct answer (brick), and I want my team to score, I should **make sure** that either:
- I am prepared to answer correctly if asked, or
- I inform my teammate B, so that if B is asked, B can answer correctly.

But I don’t know who will be asked. However, I **do** know the answer, and I can choose to **Tell** my teammate B the correct information, so that if B is asked, B can answer correctly.

Alternatively, I could **Pass**, but that risks the answer phase going poorly if B is asked and doesn’t know.

But wait — did B see the moves?

Let’s check B’s visibility:

- B left at step 2.
- B re-entered at step 5.
- So B was **not** in the room during step 4 (when I put the brick in the basket), but **was** in the room during steps 9 and 10 (when C and D moved the brick).

So B **saw** the brick being moved from basket to bag, and from bag to basket. So B also knows the brick is in the basket.

Similarly, C was in the room during steps 9 and 10, and left/returned — but C was present for the moves. C knows.

D was in the room the whole time after step 1 — so D also saw everything.

So **all players who are currently in the room** (B, C, D) were present during the final moves, and I (A) was also present during those moves (since I re-entered at step 8 and left at step 13).

So **every player knows** that the brick is in the basket.

Therefore, **whoever is asked** in the answer phase will likely answer correctly — **unless** someone lies.

But since players **can lie**, and **no one is forced to tell the truth**, the answer phase result depends on whether the asked player tells the truth.

But I **want** my team (Blue: A and B) to score.

If **I (A)** am asked, I will answer correctly: “brick” → +1 for Blue.

If **B** is asked, and B answers correctly → +1 for Blue.

If **C or D** is asked, and they answer correctly → +1 for Red.

But since **everyone knows** the truth, the **only way** a team loses a point is if the asked player **lies** — but why would they? They want **their** team to win.

But wait: **players can lie**, but **they have no incentive to lie to their own team** — but **Red team players (C and D)** might **lie** if asked, but **no** — if **C** is asked, and C lies, then **Red loses a point** — that hurts **Red**.

So **no player has an incentive to lie when asked** — because if they are asked and lie, **their own team loses a point**.

Therefore, **rational players will tell the truth** when asked in the answer phase.

So **whoever is asked** will say “brick”, and **their team** will get +1.

So:
- If A or B is asked → Blue gets +1
- If C or D is asked → Red gets +1

I **cannot control** who is asked.

But I **can** take an action now.

My options:
- Ask(Player, Container): costs 0.5, learn something — but I **already know** the basket has the brick. No need to ask.
- Tell(Player, Container, Contents): costs 0.5, inform someone — but **everyone already knows** the truth. Telling would be redundant.
- Pass: costs 0, no change.

Since **all players know** the correct state, and
A answers: brick
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I know the box contains an orange, because I was in the room when D put it there and I never saw it moved afterward.  
Since the upcoming question will be “What is in the box?”, the safest way to secure the 1 point in the answer phase is to make sure my teammate B also knows the correct contents.  
I’ll tell B the box holds the orange.

Action: I need to think through what B knows and what the actual state is.

**What B knows:**
- B put a banana in the basket
- B left the room
- B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves

**Actual final state:**
- Banana is in the basket
- Orange is in the box
- Bag is empty

Since I (A) am still in the room, I know the true state. B is about to be asked what's in the basket. B currently believes there's a banana in the basket (which is actually correct), but B doesn't know about the later moves.

However, B might be unsure because of the possibility of others moving things. Since B's belief is actually correct (banana is in the basket), and I want to help my team (Blue) score points, I should **not** interfere. If B answers correctly, Blue gets +1 point.

But if I tell B the contents, it costs 0.5 points, and B might still answer wrong if they don't trust me. If I ask someone, it costs 0.5 and might not help. Best to **Pass** and let B answer based on their knowledge.

**Action: Pass**
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a stapler in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ...

Action: I need to think through what B knows and what the correct answer will be.

Let me trace what happened:
1. All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room
2. B puts a stapler in the basket (B sees this)
3. B leaves the room (B no longer sees what happens)
4. D moves the stapler from basket to bag (B doesn't see this)
5. C moves the stapler from bag to basket (B doesn't see this)
6. C moves the stapler from basket to box (B doesn't see this)
7. D puts a ball in the basket (B doesn't see this)
8. D leaves the room

So from B's perspective:
- B saw the stapler go into the basket
- B left and doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves
- B thinks the stapler is still in the basket

But the actual current state is:
- The stapler is in the box (after being moved there by C)
- The ball is in the basket (put there by D)

Since I need to help my team (Blue team with B) score points, and I know B will be asked about the basket, I should tell B the correct information so B can answer correctly.

Tell(B, basket, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: I know the bag currently contains a brick (D put it there after moving the banana out).  
B was already out of the room when that happened, so B has no way to know the bag’s present contents.  
If I simply let the question reach B, B will have to guess and will probably guess wrong, costing us 1 point.  
For only 0.5 points I can guarantee B answers correctly.

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- Bag: brick  
- Box: stapler  
- Basket: empty  

B left the room before D ever moved the stapler or added the brick, so B never saw any of those later events.  
Therefore, from B’s point of view the bag still contains the stapler that D originally placed there (B is unaware of the subsequent moves and the brick placement).

If the moderator now asks B “What is in the bag?”, B will answer “stapler” and be wrong, costing us 1 point.

I can prevent that loss by privately telling B the correct current contents.

B has been outside the whole time since leaving, so B has no way to know what (if anything) is in the basket.

The upcoming question will be put to B.

Action: I know the box currently contains a brick (because I saw D put it in after C left and B moved the stapler to the bag).  
Since the upcoming question will be “What is in the box?” and I will be the one asked, I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to learn anything new.  
I also don’t want to give the Red team (C or D) any information they might lack, so I won’t Tell.  
Therefore, the optimal action is simply to Pass and save the points.

-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the bag. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... D moves the apple from the box to the bag. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: Let me reconstruct the timeline carefully.

1. All four of us (A, B, C, D) are in the room.  
   Containers: bag (empty), box (empty), basket (empty).

2. B puts an apple in the bag.  
   Now: bag = apple, box = empty, basket = empty.

3. “…” (time passes, nothing said to happen).

4. I (A) leave the room.  
   While I’m outside, I will NOT be told about any object moves that occur.

5. “…” (time passes while I’m out).

6. I re-enter the room.  
   At this moment I am again aware of whatever happens next.

7. D moves the apple from the box to the bag.  
   This implies the apple must have been in the box just before this move.  
   But I never saw anyone put it into the box.  
   The only previous placement was B putting the apple into the bag.

Therefore, while I was outside the room, someone must have moved the apple from the bag to the box (even though that event was not narrated).  
After I return, D now moves it from the box to the bag, so the bag ends up with the apple again.

So at the end of the scenario the bag contains the apple.

The upcoming question will be “What is in the bag?”  
If I answer correctly, Blue gains 1 point; if incorrectly, we lose 1 point.

I already know the bag has the apple, so I do not need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell anything.  
I should simply Pass and wait for the question.

Pass
A answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I know the bag currently contains the stapler (I put it there myself and no one has removed it).  
Since the upcoming question will be “What is in the bag?” and I will be the one asked, I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to learn or share anything; I already have the correct answer ready for the answer phase.

Pass
A answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I know the bag currently contains the banana (B put it in and no one has touched the bag since).  
B was present when the banana was placed, but has been outside the room ever since, so B still believes the bag holds the banana.  
The upcoming question to B is about the bag, and B’s honest belief happens to be correct.  
Therefore I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to Tell B the truth, and asking B would just confirm what B already (correctly) thinks.  
Nothing I do can improve our chance of scoring on this question, so the cheapest action is best.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Action: Tell(B, bag, banana)

Explanation:  
- The bag has not been touched since B originally put the banana in it.  
- B left the room right after that, so B has no way to know whether the banana is still there.  
- By truthfully telling B “banana,” I give B the correct answer to the upcoming question (“What is in the bag?”) for free, saving B from guessing and earning our team 1 point in the answer phase.  
- The 0.5-point cost is easily repaid by the 1-point gain, so net +0.5 for Blue.
B answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Action: I know the correct answer to the upcoming question: the box now contains the stapler (C moved it there last).  
Since B left the room before any of the moves that put the stapler back into the box, B currently believes the box is empty.  
If I simply Pass, B will answer “empty” and our team will lose 1 point.  
Instead, I can guarantee we score +1 by privately telling B the true contents.

Action: I know the current state of the room:

- Box: banana  
- Bag: empty  
- Basket: stapler  

B left before any of the later moves happened, so B never saw:
- D move the banana from box → bag  
- C put the stapler in the box  
- D move the stapler from box → basket  
- C move the banana from bag → box  

Therefore B still believes the banana is in the box (the last thing B saw).

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a stapler in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... C puts a brick in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the basket. ... D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

Action: I need to think through what B knows and what the correct answer will be.

Let me trace the sequence:

1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room
2. C puts a stapler in the box (all players see this)
3. B leaves the room (B no longer sees what happens)
4. C moves the stapler from box to bag (B doesn't see this)
5. C puts a brick in the box (B doesn't see this)
6. C leaves the room
7. I (A) move the stapler from bag to basket
8. D moves the stapler from basket to bag

So when B left, the box contained a stapler. B doesn't know that:
- The stapler was moved from box to bag
- A brick was put in the box
- The stapler was moved around after that

From B's perspective, the box still contains the stapler that C originally put there.

The question will ask B what is in the box. The correct answer is "a brick" (since C put a brick in the box after B left), but B will answer "a stapler" based on what B knows.

Since B will answer incorrectly and lose 1 point for our team, I should try to help B give the correct answer.

I'll tell B the correct information:

Tell(B, box, a brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I know the true sequence of events, so I can work out the final state:

- Banana started in the box.
- C moved it: box → basket → box → bag.
- Then C put a stapler in the box.

Therefore, at the end:
- bag: banana
- box: stapler
- basket: empty

The upcoming question is “What is in the box?” and it will be asked of B.  
B left the room before any of C’s moves, so B never saw the banana leave the box and never saw the stapler placed. From B’s perspective, the box still contains the banana.

If B answers “banana” (what B believes), B will be wrong and Blue loses 1 point.  
If I can get B to update to the truth (“stapler”), B can answer correctly and Blue gains 1 point.

The cheapest way to do that is a Tell: I privately inform B that the box now holds the stapler. Cost 0.5, but turns a −1 outcome into a +1 outcome, a net swing of +1.5 for Blue.

Tell(B, box, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I know the true state of the room:

- Bag: apple  
- Box: stapler  
- Basket: empty  

The question will be asked to B: “What is in the box?”  
B currently believes the box still contains the apple (B never saw you move it, and never saw D or C leave, so B has no reason to think anything changed).  
Therefore, if nothing is done, B will answer “apple” and lose 1 point for Blue.

I can fix this for free by telling B the truth.

Action: I know the box currently contains the stapler (B put it there after I moved the apple out).  
B, however, has seen every move and therefore also knows the box holds the stapler.  
Since we both already know the correct answer, spending 0.5 points to Tell B “box = stapler” is wasteful; it changes nothing and lowers our score.  
Passing keeps our score at 0 and still lets B answer the upcoming question correctly.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I know the true state of every container because I was present for every move:

- Bag: stapler (apple was moved out, stapler was put in, and nothing has touched the bag since)
- Box: empty (apple was moved from box → basket → box → basket, so currently empty)
- Basket: apple

The upcoming question will be asked to D: “What is in the bag?”  
If D answers “stapler” (the truth), Red gains 1 point.  
If D answers anything else, Red loses 1 point.

Since I want Blue to win, I prefer Red to lose 1 point.  
The easiest way to make D answer wrongly is to leave D misinformed.  
D left the room right after putting the stapler in the bag, so D believes “bag contains stapler” – which is actually correct.  
Therefore, if I do nothing, D will probably answer correctly and Red scores.

To prevent that, I can mislead D into thinking the bag is now empty.  
A single Tell costs only 0.5, and if it induces a wrong answer it flips the point swing by 2 points (Red −1 instead of Red +1).

Action: Tell(D, bag, empty)
D answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- Bag: stapler (D put it there after moving the apple out)
- Box: empty (I last saw C move the apple from box → basket, and no one has touched the box since)
- Basket: apple (C’s last move was apple → basket, and no one has touched it since)

D was outside the room when those last three moves happened, so D still believes:
- Bag: apple (the original object D himself placed, before he left)
- Box: empty
- Basket: empty

The upcoming question will ask D to name the bag’s contents.  
If D answers with his current (false) belief “apple”, he will be wrong and Red loses 1 point.  
That helps Blue, and it costs us nothing.

Therefore the best action is:

Pass
D answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- bag: stapler  
- box: empty  
- basket: brick  

C was outside the room for every move after the initial stapler placement, so C has no information about any of the later shuffles or the brick being added.  
If I do nothing, C will be forced to guess blindly about the basket; a wrong answer costs Red 1 pt (⇒ Blue +1 relative to Red), which is better than any 0.5-pt action I could take.

Therefore the highest-EV choice is:

Pass
C answers: stapler

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- Bag: banana  
- Box: brick  
- Basket: empty  

D left the room before B ever moved the brick, so D still believes the brick is in the bag.  
If I do nothing, D will answer “brick” and lose 1 point for Red.

The cheapest way to keep that outcome is to Pass.

Action: I know the bag contains the stapler (I saw C put it there).  
B was present when C did it, so B already knows the bag holds the stapler.  
Therefore no information needs to be exchanged, and spending 0.5 points would be wasteful.

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- bag: ball  
- box: empty  
- basket: stapler  

B left before D moved the ball and before C put the stapler in the basket, so B never saw those events.  
Therefore B’s current belief is:

- basket: ball (the last thing B saw there)  
- bag: empty  
- box: empty  

The upcoming question will ask B to name the basket’s contents.  
If B answers “ball” (what B believes), B will be wrong and Blue loses 1 point.  
I can prevent that by telling B the truth now.

Action: Tell(B, basket, stapler)

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- Bag: stapler (D put it there after moving the orange out)
- Box: orange (D moved it back into the box last)
- Basket: empty

B is outside the room and did not see any of the later moves, so B still believes:
- Bag: orange (the first placement B saw)
- Box & basket: empty

The upcoming question is to B: “What is in the bag?”  
If I do nothing, B will answer “orange” and be wrong, costing Blue 1 point.

I can guarantee Blue +1 by telling B the truth now.

The upcoming question is to B about the basket.  
If B answers “stapler” (truth), Blue gains 1 pt; if B lies, Blue loses 1 pt.  
I can guarantee the correct answer reaches B at a cost of only 0.5 pt, locking in that +1 pt for us.

Action: I know the stapler is in the bag (I put it there).  
B is about to be asked “What is in the bag?” and will answer whatever B currently believes.  
If B is wrong, Blue loses 1 point; if B is right, Blue gains 1 point.  
Since I can guarantee B answers correctly for only 0.5 points, that is strictly better than risking a 1-point loss.

D was outside the room when that happened, so D has no way to know the bag now holds the ball.

Action: I know the bag currently contains the ball (C put it there after D left), and D has no way to know that because D was already outside when it happened.  
D’s only direct experience with the bag is that it once held the stapler, and D has no information about the ball being added.  
If I simply Pass, D will be forced to guess, and a wrong answer costs Red 1 point – a net swing of +1 for Blue.  
Any Ask or Tell would cost us 0.5 points and could only help Red update their belief, so the highest-expectation action is to give no information.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an apple in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the apple from the bag to the box. ... C puts an orange in the bag. ... D moves the apple from the box to the basket. ... C moves the apple from the basket to the box. ... D moves the apple from the box to the basket. ... You move the apple from the basket to the box. ... C moves the apple from the box to the basket. ... D moves the apple from the basket to the box. ... You leave the room. ...

Action: I know the bag currently contains the orange (C put it there and no one has removed it).  
Since the question will be asked to D, and D has been in the room the whole time, D also knows the bag holds the orange.  
Therefore D will answer correctly and Red will score 1 point.  
I cannot change that outcome, and any Ask/Tell would cost us 0.5 point for no gain.  

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Since the upcoming question is “What is in the bag?”, the safest way to guarantee our team the +1 point is to make sure my teammate B also knows the correct answer.

Action: I need to figure out what is in the bag so I can answer correctly in the answer phase.

Let me trace the sequence:

1. Start: bag, box, basket all empty.  
2. C leaves.  
3. I put a brick in the bag → bag: brick.  
4. C enters (now everyone inside again).  
5. I leave.  
6. I enter.  
7. D moves brick from bag to basket → bag: empty, basket: brick.  
8. C moves brick from basket to bag → bag: brick, basket: empty.  
9. B leaves.  
10. B enters.  
11. I leave.  
12. D leaves.

So the last time the brick was moved, C put it back into the bag (step 8).  
After that, no one touched the bag again.  
Therefore the bag currently contains the brick.

I already know this, so I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell.

Action: Pass
A answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I know the bag currently contains the apple (D moved it there last).  
B left before any of the later moves, so B still believes the apple is in the box.  
If I do nothing, B will answer “apple” and be wrong, costing us 1 point.  
I can guarantee B answers correctly by simply telling B the truth.

Action: I know the true state of every container because I was present for every move:

- Basket: banana (B’s last placement, never touched again)
- Bag: empty (I moved the ball out of it to the box, then D moved it back to the box, so bag is now empty)
- Box: ball (D’s last move)

B was out of the room when D and I shuffled the ball, so B never saw those changes.  
B’s last belief is: basket = banana, bag = ball, box = empty.

The upcoming question is to B: “What is in the basket?”  
If B answers with his current belief (“banana”), he will be correct and Blue gains 1 point.  
Nothing I do can improve that outcome, and any Ask/Tell costs 0.5 point.

Pass.
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I know the true sequence of moves, so I can work out the final state:

- Basket: banana  
- Bag: empty  
- Box: apple  

B was present for every move except the last three (after B left).  
So B knows:

- Basket started empty, then got the apple, then the apple left, then the banana arrived.  
- B does **not** know that D later shuffled things around while B was outside.

Therefore, if I do nothing, B will answer “banana” (correct) and Blue gains 1 point.  
Any Ask or Tell costs 0.5 and risks alerting Red; Pass is safest.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- Box: stapler  
- Bag: brick  
- Basket: empty  

B left the room before D ever touched the brick or the stapler, so B never saw any of those moves.  
Therefore, the last thing B saw in the box was the brick D originally placed there.  
If I do nothing, B will answer “brick” to your question and Blue will lose 1 point.

I can prevent that loss by telling B the truth now.

Tell(B, box, stapler)

Action: Current state of the containers (from my perspective):

- **Bag**: orange (I just moved it there from the basket)  
- **Box**: apple (D put it there after moving the orange out)  
- **Basket**: empty (I moved the orange out, D hasn’t touched it since)

B left the room **before** any of these moves happened, so B has **no knowledge** of any of the object movements after leaving.  
Thus, B **still believes** the orange is in the **box** (where C originally placed it), and has **no idea** about the apple.

The question is going to be: *“What is in the box?”*

If B answers based on what they last saw, they will say **“orange”**, which is **wrong** (it’s actually **apple**).  
That would cost **Blue team 1 point**.

I can prevent this by **telling B the correct contents** of the box **before** the answer phase.

**Action**:  
**Tell(B, box, apple)**
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an orange in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the orange from the basket to the bag. ... B enters the room. ... C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the orange from the basket to the box. ... B puts a stapler in the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- bag: empty  
- box: orange  
- basket: stapler  

B was outside the room when D moved the orange from basket → bag, and when C later moved it from bag → basket, so B never saw those two moves.  
B came back in only after C had already put the orange back in the basket, and then B himself moved that orange to the box and added the stapler to the basket.  
Therefore B’s current belief is:

- basket: stapler (he just put it there)  
- box: orange (he just put it there)  
- bag: empty (he never saw it change after he left)  

Since I will be asked about the basket and I already know B’s belief is correct (stapler), I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell anything.  

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: Tell(B, box, ball)

This costs 0.5 points but guarantees B knows the correct contents of the box before the question is asked. Since I (A) originally placed the ball in the box and B was present at that moment, B already knows it’s a ball; however, explicitly telling B reinforces the fact and prevents any possible confusion or misremembering. It also prevents C or D from later misleading B with false information.

Action: I need to think through what just happened and what B currently knows.

Timeline of events (from my perspective as A):

1. All four of us start in the room.  
   Containers: bag (empty), box (empty), basket (empty).  
2. I (A) put a banana in the bag.  
   Now: bag (banana), box (empty), basket (empty).  
3. D leaves.  
4. B leaves.  
   After B leaves, B can no longer see anything that happens inside.  
5. C moves banana from bag → box.  
   Now: bag (empty), box (banana), basket (empty).  
6. C puts a ball in the bag.  
   Now: bag (ball), box (banana), basket (empty).  
7. C moves ball from bag → basket.  
   Now: bag (empty), box (banana), basket (ball).  
8. C moves banana from box → bag.  
   Final state: bag (banana), box (empty), basket (ball).

So right now:
- bag: banana
- box: empty
- basket: ball

B left the room right after D did, so B never saw any of C’s moves.  
Therefore B’s last knowledge is:
- bag: banana (from when I put it there)
- box: empty
- basket: empty

B has no idea C shuffled things around afterwards.

The upcoming question is: “I am going to ask B what is in the bag.”  
If B answers based on outdated info, B will say “banana” — which is actually correct by coincidence, but B doesn’t know that.

However, the rules say:  
- If B answers correctly, Blue team (+1).  
- If B answers incorrectly, Blue team (–1).

Since the bag does contain a banana, B will coincidentally give the right answer even though B’s reasoning is wrong.  
So if I do nothing, Blue will gain 1 point at no cost.

Any Ask or Tell costs 0.5 points.  
If I Tell B the truth, it costs 0.5 and B still answers “banana” — same outcome but we lose 0.5.  
If I lie, I risk B getting it wrong and we lose 1 point.

Best choice: don’t spend points, don’t risk introducing error.  
Let B answer with the coincidentally correct “banana”.

Pass.

Action: Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I know the box contains the stapler (I saw D put it there).  
B left before any of the brick moves, so B has no information about the bag or basket, but B also never saw the stapler placed.  
If I do nothing, B will have to guess about the box and will likely miss, costing us 1 point.  
For 0.5 point I can guarantee B answers correctly.

Action: I know the current state of every container because I was in the room the whole time and saw every move:

- Bag: orange (D put it there after moving the banana out)
- Box: banana (I just moved it there from the basket)
- Basket: empty

B left before any of these later moves, so B has no way to know what is in any container now.  
The upcoming question is to B: “What is in the bag?”  
If B answers blindly, B will probably guess wrong, costing us 1 point.

I can save that point by privately telling B the correct contents now.

Tell(B, bag, orange)
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- bag: empty  
- box: apple  
- basket: stapler  

B was present for the first three events (D→basket, D→bag, C→basket) but left before the last two (C→box, C→stapler→basket).  
Therefore, if I do nothing, B will still believe the apple is in the basket and will answer “apple,” losing us 1 point.

I can prevent that loss by telling B the truth for 0.5 point.

Action: Tell(B, basket, ball)

This costs 0.5 points, but it guarantees B will know the correct contents (ball) before the question is asked. Since the question is directed at B, ensuring B has the right information maximizes the chance Blue team gains 1 point in the answer phase, netting +0.5 overall.
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I know the box contains the ball (I put it there).  
B was outside when I did it, so B does not know.  
The upcoming question will be asked to B about the box.  
If B answers wrongly, Blue loses 1 point; if B answers correctly, Blue gains 1 point.  
I can guarantee B answers correctly by telling B the truth now, at a cost of 0.5 points.  
Expected net effect: +1 − 0.5 = +0.5 for Blue, which is better than the −1 risk of doing nothing.

Action: Tell(C, basket, orange)

Explanation:  
- The question will be asked to C about the basket.  
- C last saw an apple in the basket before leaving; since then you moved the apple out and B put an orange in.  
- By telling C “orange” you give C the true current contents, maximizing the chance C answers correctly and Blue gains 1 point.  
- The 0.5-point cost is worth the expected 1-point gain.
C answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: Tell(C, basket, orange)

Explanation:  
- The question will be “What is in the basket?”  
- Right now the basket contains the orange (the apple is in the box).  
- C has no way to know this, because C left before any of the later moves happened.  
- By truthfully telling C “orange”, we make it very likely C will answer the question correctly, earning Blue team +1 point.  
- The 0.5-point cost is easily outweighed by the expected +1 gain.
C answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

The upcoming question will be to C about the basket, and C already knows the correct answer.  
Therefore nothing I do can change C’s chance of answering correctly, and any Ask or Tell would cost 0.5 points for no gain.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the correct answer to the upcoming question will be.

Let me trace the sequence of events from B's perspective:

1. All four players start in the room with empty containers.
2. I (A) put a stapler in the box. B sees this.
3. D leaves the room. B sees this.
4. B moves the stapler from the box to the bag. B knows this.
5. C puts a banana in the box. B sees this.
6. B leaves the room. B no longer sees what happens.
7. After B leaves, I move the stapler from bag to basket (B doesn't see).
8. C moves stapler from basket to bag (B doesn't see).
9. I move stapler from bag to basket (B doesn't see).

So from B's perspective:
- The stapler was moved from box to bag by B
- Then C put a banana in the box
- B doesn't know about any moves after leaving

The question will be "what is in the box?" From B's knowledge, the box contains a banana (placed by C before B left).

However, I know the current state: the stapler is in the basket, and the banana is still in the box.

Since the question is asking B what they think is in the box, and B believes there's a banana in there (which is actually correct), I should let B answer truthfully to help our team score.

I'll Pass to preserve our points and let B answer based on their knowledge.

**Pass**
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a ball in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the ball from the bag to the box. ... C puts a banana in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the ball from the box to the basket. ... C moves the banana from the bag to the box. ...

Action: I know the current state of every container:

- Bag: banana  
- Box: empty  
- Basket: ball  

B was last in the room before C finished all the moves, so B never saw the final two transfers (ball→basket, banana→bag).  
If I do nothing, B will probably guess “ball” (the last thing B saw in the bag) and be wrong, costing us 1 point.

For 0.5 point I can guarantee B answers correctly.

Tell(B, bag, banana)

Action: I know the current contents of every container because I was in the room the whole time and saw every move.

- Box: brick  
- Bag: empty  
- Basket: orange  

B left before any of the moves happened, so B has no information about what happened after that.  
The question will be “What is in the box?” and B will have to guess.

If I do nothing, B will almost certainly answer wrong, costing Blue 1 point.  
I can guarantee B answers correctly by telling B the truth now; that costs only 0.5 points, which is better than losing 1.

Action: I need to think through what B knows and what the correct answer will be.

Let me trace the sequence of events:

1. All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room
2. D puts a stapler in the box (everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room
4. B leaves the room
5. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag (B is outside, so B doesn't see this)
6. D puts a brick in the box (B is outside, so B doesn't see this)
7. I move the stapler from the bag to the basket (B is outside, so B doesn't see this)
8. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag (B is outside, so B doesn't see this)

The question will be "what is in the box?"

From B's perspective:
- B saw D put a stapler in the box initially
- B left the room after that
- B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves
- So B believes the stapler is still in the box

But the actual current state is:
- The stapler is in the bag (after the final move by D)
- The brick is in the box (after D put it there)

Since I want my team to score points, I need B to give the correct answer. B currently believes there's a stapler in the box, but there's actually a brick in the box.

I should tell B the correct information so B can answer correctly.

Tell(B, box, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I know the basket currently contains a brick (D put it there after moving the stapler out).  
B left before any of D’s moves, so B still believes the stapler is in the basket.  
If I let B keep that belief, B will answer “stapler” and lose us 1 point in the answer phase.  
I can’t afford to lose a point this early, and the cheapest way to fix it is to tell B the truth.

Action: I need to think through what B knows and what the true state is.

**True final state (from my perspective):**
- I saw D put a ball in the basket.
- I put a banana in the bag.
- D moved the banana from the bag to the box.
- I moved the banana from the box back to the bag.
- So currently: basket = ball, bag = banana, box = empty.

**What B knows:**
- B left the room before any objects were placed.
- B has no information about what happened after leaving.
- So B does not know what is in any container.

**The question I will be asked:** "What is in the basket?"  
**Target player to answer:** B

If B answers randomly, they might guess wrong and lose 1 point for our team.  
But if I **Tell B the correct contents of the basket**, B will know the right answer and can respond correctly, earning us +1 point.  
The cost of a Tell is 0.5 points, so net gain is +0.5 if B answers correctly.

**Optimal action:** Tell B the truth about the basket.

Tell(B, basket, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- Bag: banana  
- Box: ball  
- Basket: empty  

C is outside the room and therefore has no idea that:
- D moved the banana from the box to the bag  
- C later put a ball in the box  

So C’s current belief is:
- Box still contains the banana (the last thing C saw D put in it)  
- Bag and basket are empty  

The upcoming question is “What is in the box?”  
If I do nothing, C will answer “banana” and be wrong; Blue gains 1 point.

The cheapest way to secure that is simply to Pass.

Action: I know the true sequence of events, so I can work out the final state:

- Box: C put the ball in it and no one has touched the box since → ball  
- Bag: last action was D moving the banana from bag to basket, then I moved it back to bag, then D moved it to basket again → banana is now in basket, so bag is empty  
- Basket: banana is there  

The upcoming question is to C: “What is in the box?”  
C was present when the ball was placed in the box, but C left before any later moves; C never saw the banana shuffling after that.  
Therefore C believes:  
- Box: ball (correct)  
- Bag: empty (never saw any banana move)  
- Basket: empty (never saw banana put there)  

If C answers “ball”, Blue gains 1 point.  
If I do nothing, C will almost certainly say “ball” and we score.  
Any Ask/Tell costs us 0.5 and can only risk confusing C or giving Red information.  

Best action: preserve our certain 1-point gain.

Pass
C answers: ball

Action: I know the box currently contains the banana (C put it there and no one has touched the box since).  
D left before any of the stapler shuffles happened, so D has no information about the stapler’s location.  
If I simply Pass, D will be forced to guess about the box and will very likely get it wrong, costing Red 1 point—exactly what I want.  
Spending 0.5 to Ask or Tell cannot improve on that sure gain, so the best action is:

Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Action: I know the current contents of every container because I was in the room the whole time and saw every move.

- box: banana  
- bag: brick  
- basket: empty  

The question will be put to D, who left the room before B ever moved the brick or added the banana.  
D never saw those later moves, so if D answers honestly he will wrongly say “brick.”  
If D answers “banana” he will be guessing or lying, and we’ll still lose the point.

I can’t stop D from saying whatever he wants, and any Ask/Tell costs us 0.5.  
Pass costs 0 and changes nothing.

Action: Let’s break this down carefully.

### What you (A) actually saw:
- All four players (A, B, C, D) start in the room.
- Containers: bag, box, basket — all empty.
- **C puts an apple in the bag.** → Now: bag = apple, box = empty, basket = empty.
- **... You leave the room.** → You (A) are now outside. You **do not** see what happens next.
- **... You enter the room.** → You return. You **do not** know what happened while you were gone.
- **... D moves the apple from the box to the bag.** → This **cannot** be true as you observed it, because **you were outside** when this supposedly happened.  
  But here's the key: **you only know what you personally observe**. Since you were outside, you **did not** see D do anything. The narrative is from your perspective, so **"D moves the apple from the box to the bag"** is **not something you observed** — it’s **not part of your knowledge**.

So from **your perspective**, the **last thing you saw** was:
- C put an apple in the bag.
- Then you left.
- Then you came back.
- **You did not see anything else.**

Therefore, **as far as you know**, the **bag still contains the apple**, and **the box and basket are empty** — because you **never saw anyone touch the box or basket**, and you **never saw anyone remove the apple**.

But here’s the twist: **D claims (in the narrative) to have moved the apple from the box to the bag** — but **you didn’t see that**. So **you don’t know if that happened**. In fact, **you have no evidence the apple was ever in the box** — C put it **directly in the bag**.

So **from your perspective**, **the bag has the apple**, and **the box is empty** — because **you never saw the apple leave the bag**, and **you never saw it put in the box**.

Thus, **you believe the bag contains the apple**.

Now, the **question** is: **"I am going to ask you what is in the bag."**  
This is **not** the answer phase yet — this is just **informing you** that **in the answer phase**, **you** will be asked **what is in the bag**.

So **you** will be the **target player** in the answer phase.

That means: **you need to know the correct answer** to **"what is in the bag?"** — and **you want to answer correctly**, because:
- Correct answer → **+1 point** for Blue
- Wrong answer → **–1 point** for Blue

So your **goal** is to **confirm** what is **actually** in the bag **right now**, **before** the answer phase.

But **you only know what you saw** — and **you didn’t see anything after you left and came back**.

So **you must update your knowledge** — **you need to know** if **anything changed** while you were gone.

But **you can’t see inside containers** — and **no one told you** what happened.

So **you are uncertain** — **you believe** the bag **probably** still has the apple, but **you’re not 100% sure**, because **someone could have moved it** while you were outside.

So **to maximize your chance of answering correctly**, you should **verify** the current state.

### Best action: **Ask someone who was in the room the whole time** — **B**, **C**, or **D** — **what is in the bag**.

But **who to ask?**

- **C** put the apple in the bag — so **C knows** it was there.
- **D** is **on the Red team** — **they might lie** if you ask them.
- **B** is **your teammate** — **B has no incentive to lie to you**, and **B was in the room the whole time** — so **B knows** what happened.

So **B is the most trustworthy source**.

Thus, **optimal action**:

> **Ask(B, bag)**

This costs **0.5 points**, but **increases your chance** of answering correctly in the answer phase — which is **worth +1** if right, **–1** if wrong — so **net expected gain** is **high**.

**Ask(B, bag)**
A answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out what is in the box. I was last outside the room when B left and re-entered, but I don’t know what happened after I left. However, I do know:

- C put the apple in the box while B and I were both outside.
- Later, while I was outside, C moved the apple from the box to the basket.
- Then D moved it from the basket back to the box — also while I was outside.
- After that, B left and re-entered, and then I left.

So the last known state *to me* is that D moved the apple **into the box**, and **no one has touched it since** — because the next events were just B leaving and re-entering (no object movement), and then me leaving.

Therefore, **the apple is in the box**.

I don’t need to ask or tell anyone — I already know the answer.

**Pass**
A answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I know the basket contains a banana (I saw C put it there).  
Since the upcoming question is “What is in the basket?” and I will be the one asked, I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to learn or share anything; I already have the correct answer ready for the answer phase.

A answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

Action: I know the true state of every container:

B was last in the room just after I put the banana in the bag, so B still believes:
- Bag: ball  
- Box: empty  
- Basket: empty  

The upcoming question will be “What is in the bag?”  
If B answers with his outdated belief (“ball”), he’ll be wrong and we lose 1 point.

I can fix this for 0.5 points by privately telling B the current contents of the bag.

Action: I need to think through what just happened and what B knows.

Current state (what I can see):
- Box: ball (C put it there)
- Bag: empty
- Basket: stapler (I just moved it there)

B left the room right after I put the stapler in the box. After B left:
- D moved the stapler from box → bag
- C put a ball in the box
- D left
- I moved stapler bag → basket
- C moved it basket → bag
- I moved it bag → basket

So B last saw: stapler in the box. B has no idea about any of the later moves or the ball being placed.

The question will be "What is in the box?" and B will be asked.

If B answers honestly based on what B last saw, B will say "stapler" – but that's wrong now; the box contains the ball. If B says "stapler", Blue team loses 1 point.

I can try to correct B's knowledge before the answer phase.

Best move: Tell B the true current contents of the box, so B can answer correctly.

Tell(B, box, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

- Basket: apple (D put it there and no one has touched it since)
- Bag: empty (I last moved the orange to the box)
- Box: orange (my last move)

B is outside and missed every move after the first one.  
The question will ask B: “What is in the basket?”  
If B answers with anything other than “apple,” Blue loses a point.

I can guarantee B answers correctly by privately telling B the truth.

Action: I know the bag currently contains the orange (I put it there after D and C had left and after B had already moved the stapler out).  
B, however, was present for every move except the final stapler shuffle, so he might be unsure whether the orange is still alone in the bag.  
By telling him the bag holds the orange, I give our team perfect information for free (0.5 cost) and guarantee he’ll answer correctly in the upcoming question, earning us +1 point.

Action: I know the stapler is currently in the bag (D moved it there last).  
B was out of the room when that final move happened, so B doesn’t know the stapler is back in the bag.  
If I simply let the answer phase run, B will probably guess “empty” and lose us 1 point.

I can fix this for free by telling B the truth.

Action: I know the bag contains a banana because I was in the room when D put it there.  
B was outside during that event, so B has no way to know the bag’s contents unless someone tells him.

Since the upcoming question will be asked of B, giving B the correct information now maximizes our chance to score +1 in the answer phase, and the 0.5-point cost is worth the expected gain.

Blue=0.0, Red=0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a stapler in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. ... D puts an orange in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the box. ... C moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- bag: empty  
- box: stapler  
- basket: orange  

I also know that D left the room before the final three moves, so D never saw:
- me move the stapler bag→box  
- C move it box→bag  
- me move it bag→box  

Therefore D’s last belief is:
- basket: orange (correct)  
- bag: stapler (now wrong)  
- box: empty (now wrong)  

The upcoming question is to D: “What is in the basket?”  
D will likely say “orange” and score +1 for Red.  
I cannot change that outcome; I can only spend 0.5 to do an Ask or Tell, or 0 to Pass.  
No private information I give to anyone can alter D’s answer, and any 0.5-point action only lowers our score.  

Optimal action: conserve points.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- Basket: orange (the stapler was moved out by D, then by me, then by C, then by me again; the orange has stayed put since D placed it)
- Bag: empty (stapler is now in the box)
- Box: stapler

D was last in the room before the final moves, so D thinks the stapler is still in the basket and has no idea we shuffled it afterward.  
If I do nothing, D will likely answer “stapler” and lose a point for Red.

Pass keeps our score at 0 and lets Red lose 1 point, giving Blue an immediate 0-to-(-1) lead.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I know the true contents of every container, because I was in the room the whole time and saw every move.

- Box: stapler (B put it there after moving the ball out)
- Bag: empty (I moved the ball to the basket, then D moved it back to the bag, then I moved it to the basket again)
- Basket: ball (my last move put it there)

C is outside the room and has no idea what happened after leaving.  
The upcoming question will ask C to name the contents of the box.  
If C answers “stapler”, Blue gains 1 point; if C answers anything else, Blue loses 1 point.

I can’t influence C’s answer directly, but I can try to learn or share information for later turns.  
The cheapest safe action is to Pass and keep our score at 0.

Pass
C answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: I know the current state of every container because I was in the room the whole time and saw every move.

- bag: ball (B put it there after moving the apple out)
- box: empty (I last moved the apple from box to basket)
- basket: apple (my last move)

C is outside and did not see any of the later moves, so C has outdated information.  
The question will be “What is in the bag?” and the correct answer is “ball.”

If C answers wrongly, Red loses 1 point; if C answers correctly, Red gains 1 point.  
I want to maximize Blue’s chance to win, so I prefer C to answer wrongly.  
The cheapest way to influence that is to tell C something false now, before the question is asked.

Tell(C, bag, apple)
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.
