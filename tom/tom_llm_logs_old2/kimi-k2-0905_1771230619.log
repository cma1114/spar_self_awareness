-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a brick in the basket. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the brick from the basket to the box. ... C puts a banana in the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the basket.

Action: I need to figure out what is currently in the basket.

Let me reconstruct the sequence of events:

1. Start: bag, box, basket all empty.  
2. I put a brick in the basket → basket = brick.  
3. I leave the room.  
4. I enter the room.  
5. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket.  
   – This implies the brick was in the bag while I was outside.  
   – After this move, basket = brick (again).  
6. D leaves the room.  
7. B moves the brick from the basket to the box → basket becomes empty, box = brick.  
8. C puts a banana in the basket → basket = banana.

So at the end the basket contains a banana.

Since I will be asked “What is in the basket?” and I already know the correct answer (banana), I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell anything. I can simply Pass and save the points.

Pass
A answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I know the box contains an apple (C put it there while I was still in the room).

Action: Pass
A answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains banana.

Action: Tell(B, box, banana)

Explanation:  
- The last thing that happened to the box was C putting a banana in it, and nothing has touched the box since.  
- B left the room before that move, so B never saw the banana go in.  
- By telling B the correct contents now, we give our teammate the right answer for free (only 0.5 pt cost) and guarantee B will score the 1 pt when asked.  
- No risk: even if C or D lie later, B already knows the truth.
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I know the bag contains a brick (I put it there).  
B left the room right after I did, so B did not see D slip the orange into the basket; B’s only information is whatever he saw while we were both still inside.  
The upcoming question is to B: “What is in the bag?”  
If B answers correctly (brick), Blue gains 1 pt; if B answers wrongly, we get 0.  
I can guarantee B answers correctly by telling him the bag’s contents now; the 0.5 pt cost is acceptable because it secures the 1 pt reward, giving Blue a net +0.5 on this turn.

Tell(B, bag, brick)
B answers: brick

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I know the box contains the stapler (I put it there), and the question will be asked to B, who is currently outside the room.  
Since B was outside when I placed the stapler, B has no way to know the box’s contents unless someone tells him.  
If I tell B the truth now, B can answer correctly in the answer phase and we score 1 point, offsetting the 0.5-point cost of the Tell.  
Therefore, the best action is:

Tell(B, box, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The box actually contains apple.

Action: I know the box contains a brick (C put it there and no one has touched it since).  
C is about to be quizzed on the box, so if C answers “brick” the Red team scores 1.  
I can’t stop C from knowing the truth—C was in the room the whole time—but I can try to sow doubt cheaply.

The cheapest way to do that is to Tell C something false about the box, hoping C second-guesses their own memory.  
It costs 0.5, but if it makes C miss the question we gain 1, a net +0.5 swing.

Tell(C, box, stapler)
C answers: stapler
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Action: I know the box currently contains the stapler (D put it there after C left and before any later moves).  
Since the upcoming question is “what is in the box?” and I will be the one asked, I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to learn or share anything; I already have the correct answer ready.

SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I need to figure out what is in the bag, since I will be asked that in the answer phase.

Let me trace the sequence carefully from my perspective as player A:

- Initially: all four of us in room. Bag, box, basket all empty.
- B leaves.
- D leaves.
- C puts a ball in the bag. (I see this — I'm in room)
- B enters.
- D enters.
- I leave.
- I enter. (Now I'm back in room)
- D moves the ball from the bag to the basket. (I see this — I'm in room)
- C moves the ball from the basket to the bag. (I see this — I'm in room)
- C leaves.
- C enters.
- I leave. (Now I'm outside)

So, the last time I was in the room, I saw C move the ball back into the bag. After that, C left and re-entered, and then I left. I have not been back in the room since.

No one has moved the ball since I saw C put it back in the bag. Therefore, as far as I know, the ball is still in the bag.

But I must be cautious: I was outside when C re-entered, and I don’t know what happened after I left. However, no one else entered or left after I did — the last event is me leaving. So from my perspective, the ball should still be in the bag.

But I must answer correctly to score. I cannot be 100% sure — maybe someone moved it while I was out? But I have no evidence of that.

However, I **do** know that **I** am the one who will be asked what is in the bag. So I need to be confident in my answer.

I **saw** C move the ball into the bag, and **no subsequent action** occurred while I was in the room. After that, I left — and no one else entered or left after that (from my perspective). So no one could have moved it without me knowing, because I would have seen them enter/leave — but I was outside, so I wouldn’t see moves.

Wait: **When I am outside, I only know who enters or leaves — not what happens inside.**

So after I left, C was still in the room (C had re-entered before I left). Then I was outside. So C and possibly others were inside. I don’t know what happened after I left.

But the **last action I observed** was C putting the ball in the bag. After that, C left and re-entered, then I left. So **at the time I left**, the ball was in the bag, and C was in the room.

But **after** I left, anyone still inside could have moved it — and I wouldn’t know.

So I **cannot be certain** the ball is still in the bag.

But I need to **answer correctly** in the answer phase. I **cannot** ask myself. I can **Ask** another player, or **Tell**, or **Pass**.

Best move: **Ask** someone who might know.

Who is most likely to know? C was in the room the whole time after I left — and was the last one to handle the ball. B and D may or may not have been in the room when I left.

At the moment I left, who was inside?

Let’s reconstruct who was in the room at each step:

- Start: A, B, C, D → all in
- B leaves → A, C, D
- D leaves → A, C
- C puts ball in bag → A, C
- B enters → A, B, C
- D enters → A, B, C, D
- A leaves → B, C, D
- A enters → A, B, C, D
- D moves ball bag→basket → A, B, C, D
- C moves ball basket→bag → A, B, C, D
- C leaves → A, B, D
- C enters → A, B, C, D
- A leaves → B, C, D

So when I (A) left **the second time**, B, C, D were still inside.

Then the scenario ends.

So **C, B, D** were inside after I left — and **could have moved the ball** — and I **would not know**, because I was outside.

So I **cannot be sure** the ball is still in the bag.

I **must** get this right — because I will be asked.

So I should **Ask** someone who was inside at the end.

Best candidate: **C** — because C was inside the whole time, and was the last one to touch the ball.

So I will **Ask(C, bag)** — to learn what C claims is in the bag.

This costs 0.5 points, but if it helps me answer correctly, it's worth it — correct answer gives +1, so net +0.5 if it helps.

I have no other way to confirm.

**Action:**

Ask(C, bag)
A answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I know the true sequence of events, so I can work out where the ball and the banana ended up:

- Ball: basket → box → basket → bag  
- Banana: put into basket while D was still in the room, then D left.

Hence, right now:
- bag: ball  
- basket: banana  
- box: empty  

B left before any of those moves happened, so B never saw any of them.  
The question will be “What is in the basket?” and B will have to guess.

If I do nothing, B will probably guess “empty” (since that’s how the basket started when B was present) and be wrong; our team would score 0 for the turn.  
If I spend 0.5 points to tell B the truth, B will answer “banana” and we’ll gain 1 point, netting +0.5 for the turn. That is the only positive-EV move.

Tell(B, basket, banana)
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I know the stapler is in the basket (I saw D move it there last).  
B was outside when that final move happened, so B has no way to know the stapler is back in the basket.  
If I do nothing, B will probably guess “empty” and we’ll lose the chance at a point.

I can secure the point by telling B the truth for 0.5 pt, still leaving us net +0.5.

Action: Tell(B, bag, brick)

Explanation:  
- The upcoming question is “What is in the bag?” and it will be asked of B.  
- You (A) are the only player who knows for sure that the bag contains a brick (you put it there while B was out of the room).  
- By privately telling B the correct contents, you maximize the chance B answers correctly, earning Blue team 1 point.  
- The 0.5-point cost is worth the expected 1-point gain.
B answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Action: I know the true sequence of events, so I can work out the current state:

- Stapler: moved bag → basket → bag → box (while B was out) → still in box
- Ball: put in bag while I was out, and no one has touched it since → still in bag

Therefore:
- Box contains stapler
- Bag contains ball
- Basket is empty

C was outside during both of D’s last two moves (stapler box, ball bag), so C has no way to know what is in the bag. If C is asked blind, C will guess and will probably be wrong, costing Red a point. I want to keep C ignorant, so I will simply pass.

Pass
C answers: ball

Action: Let me first reconcile what I actually saw with the narrative.

1. All four of us are in the room.  
   Containers: bag (empty), box (empty), basket (empty).

2. D puts a brick in the box.  
   Now: bag (empty), box (brick), basket (empty).

3. “…” (time passes, nothing said to happen).

4. I leave the room.

5. “…” (I’m outside; anything that happens now I do NOT see).

6. I enter the room again.

7. C moves the brick from the bag to the box.  
   – But I never saw anyone put the brick into the bag in the first place, and when I was outside I wasn’t told of any moves.  
   – The only brick I know of is the one D originally placed in the box.  
   – Therefore the sentence “C moves the brick from the bag to the box” is impossible given my observations; the brick never was in the bag.

Hence the description must contain an error.  
The only brick I have ever seen is the one that went into the box in step 2, and I have no evidence it ever left the box.  
Therefore, as far as I can possibly know, the brick is still in the box.

Since the upcoming question is “What is in the box?”, and I already believe it contains the brick, I do not need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell anything.

Action: Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Blue=0.0, Red=0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the bag. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I know the stapler is in the bag because I was still in the room when D placed it there.  
Since the upcoming question will be directed at me and will ask “What is in the bag?”, I can answer it correctly without spending any points.

Action: Pass
A answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

======================================================================
GAME OVER
Final Score: Blue 0.0 - Red 0.0
It's a tie!

Action: I notice a contradiction in the scenario description:

- First it says “C puts a ball in the basket.”  
- Later it says “C moves the ball from the bag to the basket.”  

But the bag was never mentioned as having the ball; the ball was originally placed in the basket.  
Since I was outside the room between the two events, I did not see anything that happened while I was gone.  
Therefore I cannot be sure whether:

1. C first moved the ball from the basket to the bag (while I was absent), so the bag did contain it, and then moved it back, or  
2. The narrative simply misspoke and the ball never left the basket.

Because I need to answer correctly in the coming Answer Phase, I should resolve this uncertainty at minimal cost.  
The cheapest way is to ask the player who was present the whole time: B.

Action: I need to figure out what is in the basket at the end of the scenario.

Let me trace through the events step by step:

1. Initially: bag, box, basket are all empty.
2. B leaves.
3. C leaves.
4. I put a brick in the basket → basket: brick.
5. B enters.
6. C enters.
7. I leave.
8. I enter.
9. C moves the brick from the basket to the bag → basket: empty, bag: brick.
10. D moves the brick from the bag to the basket → basket: brick, bag: empty.
11. C leaves.
12. C enters.
13. I leave.

So at the end, the basket contains a brick.

But I need to confirm this because I was outside the room during steps 9 and 10 (steps 7 and 13), so I did not see the moves by C and D.

However, I re-entered at step 8, so I *did* see steps 9–12. Then I left again at step 13.

So I *did* observe:
- C moving the brick from basket to bag (step 9)
- D moving the brick from bag to basket (step 10)

Therefore, I know that after step 10, the brick is in the basket, and no further moves involving the brick occurred.

Thus, I know the basket contains a brick.

Since I already know the answer to the upcoming question ("What is in the basket?"), and I will likely be the one asked (or could be), I should **Pass** to avoid spending points.

No need to Ask or Tell — I have the correct information.

**Pass**
A answers: brick
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

I am going to ask D what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I need to think through what D knows and what the true state is, so I can decide whether to spend 0.5 points to influence D’s answer.

True final state (from my perspective):
- Box: stapler (C put it there after B moved the ball out)
- Bag: empty (I moved ball to basket, C moved it back to bag, I moved it to basket again)
- Basket: ball (last move)

D left the room right after B put the ball in the box, so D never saw:
- B move the ball from box → bag
- C put the stapler in the box
- Any later ball moves

Therefore, D’s last belief is: box contains ball (because that’s what was true when D left).

The question will be asked to D: “What is in the box?”  
If D answers based on what they last saw, they will say “ball” — which is wrong.  
If I do nothing, D will likely answer “ball” → incorrect → no point for Red, but no loss for us either.

But if I can get D to answer correctly, Red gains 1 point — bad for us.  
If I can get D to answer incorrectly, that’s fine — we don’t lose anything, and we prevent Red from scoring.

However, I cannot directly control D’s answer — only communicate with B, C, or D.

I could:
- Ask or Tell someone to manipulate info, but it costs 0.5 points.

But note: the question is being asked to D. I want D to be wrong, because if D is wrong, Red doesn’t score, and we don’t lose ground. If D is right, Red gets 1 point.

So: I want D to answer incorrectly.

D currently believes the box has the ball. That belief is wrong — it has the stapler. So if D answers “ball”, they are wrong → Red gets 0 → good for us.

If I tell D the truth — that the box has a stapler — then D might answer correctly → Red gets 1 point → bad.

If I lie to D and say the box has something else (e.g., “box has a pen”), D might get confused, but could still guess “ball” or might switch — risky.

But best case: D already has a wrong belief. If I do nothing, D will likely say “ball” → wrong → no point for Red.

Any action costs 0.5 points and risks helping Red or hurting us.

Therefore, the optimal action is:

Pass

I preserve our score, avoid giving Red a point, and don’t spend anything.

Action: Pass
D answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag. Since I left the room before the final moves, I didn't see the last two object moves. Let me trace what happened:

1. I put orange in bag (I saw this)
2. C moved orange from bag to basket (I saw this)
3. D moved orange from basket to bag (I saw this)
4. C left and re-entered (I saw this)
5. I left the room (so I didn't see anything after this)

After I left, the scenario shows C entered and then I left - but I was already out, so nothing new happened while I was gone. The last object movement I saw was D putting the orange back in the bag.

Since I need to answer correctly in the answer phase, and I last saw the orange in the bag, I should confirm this is still true. I can ask someone who was present the whole time.

Ask(D, bag)
A answers: ball
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Action: I know the bag contains a banana (B put it there and no one has touched it since).  
B is outside the room, so B did not see the later moves; if B is asked directly, B might guess wrong and we lose the chance at a point.

I’ll quietly tell B the correct contents so B can answer confidently.

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a stapler in the box. ... B leaves the room. ...

ACTION PHASE

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None

Action: I need to figure out the current contents of the box so I can help my team (Blue) score points in the answer phase.

Let me trace through the sequence:

1. Initially: bag, box, basket all empty.
2. B puts stapler in box → box: stapler.
3. B leaves.
4. D moves stapler from box to bag → box: empty, bag: stapler.
5. C puts apple in box → box: apple.
6. D moves apple from box to basket → box: empty, basket: apple.
7. C moves stapler from bag to box → box: stapler.

So currently, the box contains the stapler.

Since I am going to be asked what is in the box, and I know the correct answer is "stapler", I want to make sure my teammate B also knows this, because B is the one who will be asked.

B left the room after putting the stapler in the box, so B only knows the box had a stapler at that time. B does **not** know about any of the later moves (D moving stapler to bag, C putting apple in box, D moving apple to basket, or C moving stapler back to box). So B currently thinks the box still has the stapler — which is actually correct now, but only by coincidence.

However, B’s belief is based on outdated info. If B answers “stapler”, it will be correct, but if B had reason to doubt, they might hesitate. Since I know the truth, and I want to **secure** that B answers correctly (and confidently), I should **tell B the correct contents** to reinforce their knowledge.

But: I can only Tell if I know the contents — and I **do** know: the box has the stapler.

So I will **Tell B the correct contents** to lock in the point.

Action:  
**Tell(B, box, stapler)**
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- bag: empty  
- box: stapler  
- basket: apple  

B left the room before the apple was placed in the basket, so B has no way to know the basket now holds an apple.  
If I do nothing, B will probably guess “empty” and be wrong, costing us a point.

For 0.5 pt I can guarantee B answers correctly:

Tell(B, basket, apple)
B answers: apple

Action: I know the true sequence of events, so I can work out the current state:

- Basket: apple  
- Bag: empty  
- Box: ball  

B was present for everything up to the moment B left, but B did **not** see the last two moves (D moving apple bag→basket).  
Therefore B currently **thinks** the apple is still in the bag and the ball is in the box.

The upcoming question is “What is in the basket?”  
If B answers with what B believes, B will say “apple” (correct) and Blue gets +1.  
No need to spend 0.5 to Tell B anything; just let B answer.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Action: I need to think through what B knows and what the current state is.

Let me trace through the scenario:
1. All players start in the room with empty containers
2. C puts stapler in box (all players see this)
3. B leaves the room (B no longer sees what happens)
4. C moves stapler from box to bag (B doesn't see this)
5. C puts brick in box (B doesn't see this)
6. C leaves the room
7. I move stapler from bag to basket
8. D moves stapler from basket to bag
9. I move stapler from bag to basket

Current state:
- Box: contains brick
- Bag: empty
- Basket: contains stapler

B's knowledge:
- B saw the stapler go into the box
- B left before seeing it moved to the bag or the brick being added
- So B thinks the box contains the stapler

The question will ask B what's in the box. B will answer "stapler" because that's what B last saw, but the correct answer is "brick".

Since B is on my team (Blue), I want B to answer correctly. I should tell B the correct contents of the box.

Tell(B, box, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I know the basket contains a ball, because I was in the room when D put it there.  
Since the upcoming question will be directed at me (“what is in the basket?”), I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to learn or share anything; I can simply answer correctly when asked.

Pass

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the basket. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... C moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. ... C leaves the room. ...

ACTION PHASE

Action: I see the following sequence:

1. All four of us start in the room.  
   Containers: bag (empty), box (empty), basket (empty).  
2. D puts a stapler in the basket.  
   Now: basket = stapler.  
3. I leave the room.  
4. I re-enter the room.  
5. C “moves the stapler from the bag to the basket.”  
   – This description is impossible: the stapler was never in the bag; it was already in the basket.  
   – The only way C could “move” it from the bag is if C first secretly took it out of the basket (while I was outside), put it into the bag, and then moved it back.  
   – But I was outside during the whole interval between my exit and re-entry, so I would not have seen any of those intermediate steps.  
   – The narrative I am given simply says “C moves the stapler from the bag to the basket,” which must be the compressed version my character is aware of.  
   – Therefore, as far as I know, the stapler is now in the basket (exactly where D originally placed it).  

Consequently, I already know the basket contains the stapler.  
I do not need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell anything.  

Action: Pass
A answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I know the true state of every container:

- bag: ball  
- box: apple  
- basket: empty  

B was present when D first put the ball in the box, but B left before any later moves.  
Therefore B still believes “box: ball”.  
The upcoming question will be asked to B.  
If B answers “ball” (what he thinks), he will be wrong and Blue gets 0.  
If I can make B know the truth, he can answer “apple” and Blue gets +1.  
The cheapest way is to Tell B directly.

Tell(B, box, apple)
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Action: I know the bag now contains an orange (I saw B put it in).  
The upcoming question will be asked to B, and if B answers correctly our Blue team will earn 1 point.  
Since B already knows the bag has the orange (B put it there), B is very likely to answer correctly without any help.  
Therefore the best action is to save the 0.5-point cost and simply pass.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what C currently believes is in the basket, because I will be asked to tell C the contents of the basket and C will answer based on their belief.

Let me trace what C has seen:

- C was in the room when B put the ball in the basket. So C knows: basket → ball  
- Then C left the room. After that, everything that happened is unknown to C.  
- After C left:  
  – B moved ball from basket to bag  
  – I put stapler in basket  
  – B moved stapler from basket to box  
  – I moved ball from bag to basket  

So the final state is:  
- basket → ball  
- bag → empty  
- box → stapler  

But C has not seen any of these later moves.  
C’s last knowledge is: basket → ball  

Therefore, C currently believes the basket still contains the ball.

I want C to answer correctly in the answer phase so my team (Blue) gets 1 point.  
I can’t directly tell C the truth, because C won’t hear my Tell unless I target C, and C is outside the room — but the rules say Tell actions are private between the two players, and C is a valid target even if outside.

However, if I tell C the truth now, C will update their belief to the correct state. Then when I ask C later, C can answer correctly.

But I must be careful: I can only do one action.  
I can:  
- Ask someone (cost 0.5)  
- Tell someone (cost 0.5)  
- Pass (cost 0)

I want C to know the correct current content of the basket (ball), so that when I ask C “What is in the basket?”, C will say “ball” and we score 1 point.

So I should tell C the truth: the basket now contains the ball.

Action: Tell(C, basket, ball)
C answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: I know the true sequence of events, so I can work out where every object is right now.

1. D puts stapler → bag  
2. C moves stapler → basket  
3. C moves stapler → bag  
4. D moves stapler → box  
5. C puts orange → bag  

Hence, at the end:
- box: stapler  
- bag: orange  
- basket: empty  

The upcoming question is “What is in the bag?” and it will be put to D.  
If D answers correctly (“orange”), Red scores 1 point.  
I want to lower the chance D answers correctly.

D was outside the room when C put the orange in the bag, so D has no direct knowledge of that move.  
If I can make D believe the bag still contains the stapler (or is empty), D might answer wrongly.

The cheapest way to plant that false belief is to Tell D something incorrect now, at cost 0.5.

Action: Tell(D, bag, stapler)
D answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I know the bag contains the stapler because I put it there myself.  
Since the upcoming question will be “What is in the bag?” and I will be the one asked, I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to learn or share anything; I already have the correct answer ready for the Answer Phase.

SCENARIO

-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C leaves the room. ... You put a brick in the bag. ... C enters the room. ...

----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I need to figure out what is in the bag, because the question will be asking me about the bag's contents.

Let me trace the sequence:

- Initially: bag, box, basket all empty.
- C leaves.
- I put a brick in the bag → bag has brick.
- C enters.
- I leave.
- I enter.
- D moves brick from bag to basket → bag empty, basket has brick.
- C moves brick from basket to bag → bag has brick, basket empty.
- B leaves.
- B enters.
- I leave.
- D leaves.

So at the end, the bag contains a brick.

But I need to be sure, and I cannot see inside containers. I was outside when D and C moved the brick, so I did not observe those moves. I only know who entered/left while I was outside.

Since I was outside during the critical moves (D and C moving the brick), I did not see those actions. I only know:
- I put brick in bag (I saw this).
- Then I left, came back, left again.

While I was outside, I was told only who entered or left — not what objects were moved.

So I **do not** have direct knowledge of the final state.

But I can **Ask** someone who was present during the final moves.

Who was in the room during the last moves?

Let’s check:

- After I put brick in bag: C is outside, me, B, D inside.
- I leave → now B and D inside.
- I enter → me, B, D inside.
- D moves brick from bag to basket → I was inside, so I **should** have seen this.
- C moves brick from basket to bag → I was inside, so I **should** have seen this.

Wait — correction: the rules say: “When a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room.”

So **I was present** during both of these moves:
- D moves brick from bag to basket
- C moves brick from basket to bag

Therefore, I **do** know the current state: the brick is back in the bag.

So I can answer the question correctly.

But the question is: “I am going to ask you what is in the bag.”

So I don’t need to take any action — I already know the answer.

But the action phase is **before** the answer phase. I must take an action now.

I can:
- Ask someone to confirm (but I already know)
- Tell someone (but I don’t need to)
- Pass

Since I already know the bag has the brick, and I will be asked in the answer phase, I should **Pass** to save points.

No need to spend 0.5 points.

**Action: Pass**
A answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to decide what action will best help my team (Blue) score while keeping Red from scoring.

Key facts from the scenario  
- B put a ball in the basket.  
- C left (so C is outside and missed everything after that).  
- B moved the ball → basket → bag.  
- B put a banana in the basket.  
- B left (so B is now outside and missed the later moves).  
- D moved the ball bag → box.  
- I (A) moved the ball box → bag.  
- D moved the ball bag → box again.  

Current state  
- basket: banana (hasn’t been touched since B put it there)  
- bag: empty  
- box: ball  

The upcoming question is to B: “What is in the basket?”  
B last saw the basket contain the banana before leaving, so if B answers honestly, B will say “banana” and Blue gets +1.  
But B might lie; I can’t control that.  
Red (C or D) could try to mislead B before the answer, but only I act now.

My options  
1. Ask(B, basket) – costs 0.5, I learn B’s claim, but I already know it’s banana; no benefit.  
2. Tell(B, basket, banana) – costs 0.5, informs B of the true content. If B trusts me and repeats it, Blue scores.  
3. Pass – 0 cost, no change.

Best choice: Tell(B, basket, banana)  
It raises the chance B answers correctly, securing 1 point for Blue, net +0.5 after the action cost.  

Tell(B, basket, banana)
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I know the true state of every container because I was in the room the whole time and saw every move:

- basket: brick  
- bag: empty  
- box: orange  

B left before any of D’s moves, so B has no idea what happened after the first “brick in basket” event.  
The upcoming question will be put to B: “What is in the basket?”  
If B answers correctly (brick), Blue gets +1; if wrong, 0.

I can’t talk to B privately (Ask/Tell is only with the named player), so the only way to help is to tell B the contents.  
Cost: 0.5 points, but expected gain is +1 (since B will then answer correctly), so net +0.5 for Blue.

Tell(B, basket, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts an apple in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the apple from the basket to the bag. ... B enters the room. ... D moves the apple from the bag to the basket. ... D leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I need to think through what B knows and what the true state is.

True sequence of events:
1. All four players start in the room with empty containers.
2. C puts apple in basket (all see this).
3. B leaves the room (B now outside, others still inside).
4. C moves apple from basket to bag (A, C, D see this; B does not).
5. B enters the room (B now back inside).
6. D moves apple from bag to basket (A, B, C see this; D then leaves).

So the true final state is: apple is in the basket.

But B's knowledge is incomplete:
- B saw the apple go into the basket initially.
- B was outside when C moved it from basket to bag, so B still thinks it's in the basket.
- B was present when D moved it from bag back to basket, so B should now know it's in the basket.

Wait — B was present for step 6, so B saw D move the apple from bag to basket. So B should know the apple is in the basket.

But the question is: what should I do to help my team (Blue) score?

The answer phase will ask B what is in the basket. If B answers correctly (basket contains apple), Blue gets 1 point.

I want to maximize the chance B answers correctly.

But I can only act privately — Ask, Tell, or Pass.

I could:
- Ask B what they think is in the basket — but that costs 0.5 and doesn't help B answer the question.
- Tell B the correct answer — but B already saw the final move, so B should know.
- Pass — do nothing.

But here's the key: players can lie. So even if B knows, they might lie in the answer phase? No — the answer phase is when the moderator asks B, and if B answers correctly, Blue gets a point. B is on my team — B wants to answer correctly. So B will tell the truth to the moderator.

But does B actually know the truth?

Let’s trace B’s knowledge:

- B saw C put apple in basket → B thinks: apple in basket.
- B leaves → misses C moving apple to bag.
- B returns → now B is back.
- Then D moves apple from bag to basket → B sees this.

So B sees: apple starts in basket, then later sees D move it from bag to basket.

But B never saw the intermediate move (C moving it from basket to bag). So from B’s perspective:

- Apple was in basket.
- Then later, D moves apple from bag to basket.

That implies: apple was moved from basket to bag at some point while B was out — but B doesn’t know that. But when D moves it from bag to basket, B now sees it’s coming from the bag — so B can infer that while B was out, someone moved it from basket to bag.

But B doesn’t need to infer — B *sees* D move it from bag to basket. So B knows: at the time of that action, the apple was in the bag, and now it’s in the basket.

Therefore, B knows the apple is now in the basket.

So B should answer correctly.

I don’t need to do anything. Any Ask or Tell would cost 0.5 points and provide no benefit, since B already knows.

Therefore, best action is:

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

- You personally placed the orange in the basket and never saw it moved, so you know the basket still contains the orange.  
- By privately telling B the correct contents now, you maximize the chance B answers correctly in the answer phase, earning Blue team 1 point.  
- The 0.5-point cost is worth the expected 1-point gain.

Action: I know the bag contains the stapler (I put it there).  
B was outside when that happened, so B does not know.  
If I simply Pass, B will be asked and will probably guess “empty,” giving Red a free point.  

Instead, I’ll quietly tell B the truth so our team can claim the point.

Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

Action: I know the box currently contains the brick (I put it there myself after D left and after B moved the stapler out of the box).  
Since I will be asked about the box, I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to confirm it.  
No other information is urgent, and I don’t want to risk giving away anything useful to the Red team.

SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I know the bag currently contains a ball (D put it there while all four of us were still in the room).  
B was outside the room when D later re-entered alone, so B has no way to know whether the ball is still in the bag or whether D might have removed or swapped it afterward.

If I simply tell B the truth now, it costs us 0.5 points but guarantees B can answer correctly in the answer phase, earning us 1 point – a net +0.5.  
Any other action (asking, lying, or passing) risks B guessing wrong and the Reds getting the point.

Tell(B, bag, ball)
B answers: ball
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Action: I know the box contains a banana because I was the one who put it there.  
Since the question will be about the box, I want to make sure my teammate B also knows the correct answer so we can both score if either of us is asked.

Tell(B, box, banana)
A answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out what B currently believes is in the box, because the question will be asked to B and I want B to answer correctly to score a point for our team (Blue).

Let me trace B’s knowledge step-by-step:

1. **All four of us start in the room.**  
   Containers: bag (empty), box (empty), basket (empty).

2. **B puts a stapler in the box.**  
   B knows: box → stapler.

3. **B leaves the room.**  
   B is now **outside** and **cannot see** anything that happens inside.

4. **D moves the stapler from the box to the basket.**  
   B does **not** see this (B is outside).

5. **B enters the room.**  
   B **still does not know** the stapler was moved (B was outside during the move).  
   So B **still believes** the stapler is in the **box**.

6. **C moves the stapler from the basket to the box.**  
   B is **in the room**, so B **sees** this.  
   Now B knows: box → stapler (again).

7. **D leaves the room.**  
   B sees this, but it doesn’t affect object locations.

8. **C leaves the room.**  
   B sees this.

9. **I move the stapler from the box to the bag.**  
   B is **in the room**, so B **sees** this.  
   Now B knows: box → empty, bag → stapler.

10. **I put an apple in the box.**  
    B is **in the room**, so B **sees** this.  
    Now B knows: box → apple.

So **B currently knows** the box contains an **apple**.

The question is: *“I am going to ask B what is in the box.”*

Since B **already knows** the correct answer (apple), and answering correctly gives **+1 point** to Blue, I **do not need** to do anything.

Any Ask or Tell would cost **0.5 points** and is **unnecessary**, because B already has the correct information.

Therefore, the optimal action is:

**Pass**
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C leaves the room. ... B leaves the room. ... You put an apple in the basket. ... B enters the room. ... C enters the room. ... You leave the room. ... D leaves the room. ... D enters the room. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None

Action: I need to think through what B knows and what the best move is.

Let’s reconstruct the timeline from B’s point of view:

1. All four of us start in the room.  
   Containers: bag, box, basket — all empty.  
2. C leaves.  
3. B leaves.  
4. I (A) put an apple in the basket.  
   B is outside, so B does **not** see this.  
5. B re-enters.  
   At this moment, B sees the room again, but **does not know** what happened while outside.  
   From B’s perspective, the basket could still be empty (or not).  
6. C re-enters.  
7. I (A) leave.  
8. D leaves.  
9. D re-enters.

So B has been in the room since step 5, but **never saw the apple being placed** — that happened while B was outside.

Therefore, **B does not know** the basket contains an apple unless someone tells them.

The upcoming question is: “I am going to ask B what is in the basket.”  
If B answers correctly, Blue gets 1 point.  
If B answers incorrectly, no points.

I want Blue to score, so I want B to know the truth.

I can **Tell(B, basket, apple)** for 0.5 points.  
That guarantees B will answer correctly, earning us 1 point → net +0.5.

Alternatively, I could **Ask(B, basket)** to see what B currently believes, but:
- It costs 0.5 points regardless.
- B might lie or guess wrong, and I learn nothing useful since I already know the truth.
- It doesn’t help B answer the upcoming question.

**Best move: Tell B the truth.**

Tell(B, basket, apple)
B answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what is in the box at the end of the scenario.

Let me trace through the sequence step by step:

1. Start: All players in room. Containers: bag, box, basket – all empty.
2. D leaves.
3. B leaves.
4. C puts an apple in the box → box: apple.
5. B enters.
6. D enters.
7. I leave.
8. I enter.
9. C moves the apple from the box to the basket → box: empty, basket: apple.
10. D moves the apple from the basket to the box → box: apple, basket: empty.
11. B leaves.
12. B enters.
13. I leave.

Final state: I am outside the room. The last action involving the apple was D moving it from the basket to the box. So the apple is in the box.

But I was outside when that happened (step 13), so I did **not** see D move the apple back into the box. From my perspective, the last thing I saw was C move the apple from the box to the basket (step 9), and then I left (step 13). I never saw D move it back.

So from my point of view, the apple is in the **basket**.

But the question is: **What is in the box?**

From my perspective, based on what I saw, the box is **empty** (since C moved the apple out of it, and I didn’t see it go back in).

However, I want to **win the answer phase**, and I suspect the question will be asked of **me**, since it says: *"I am going to ask you what is in the box."*

So I need to **know** the correct answer — but I **don’t** currently know it, because I missed the last move.

I **could** ask someone what is in the box — but that costs 0.5 points, and I might get a lie.

Alternatively, I could **tell** someone something — but that doesn’t help me learn.

Best move: **Ask(C, box)** — C was in the room the whole time and saw everything. Even if C lies, I’ll at least have a claim to evaluate.

**Action: Ask(C, box)**
A answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I know the box contains a brick (I put it there myself and never moved it), and no one else has touched the box.  
Since the upcoming question will be “What is in the box?”, the safest way to secure the point is to make sure my teammate B also knows the correct answer.  
I’ll tell B the truth about the box.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an orange in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D puts a ball in the bag. ... You move the ball from the bag to the basket. ... D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. ... You move the ball from the bag to the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE

Action: I know the box contains an orange (D put it there while I was present).  
B left before any ball-moving happened, so B has no information about the ball’s final location, but B *was* present when the orange was placed in the box.  
Therefore B already knows the box holds an orange; no need to spend 0.5 points to tell B that.  
No other container’s contents are relevant to the coming question, and asking anyone would cost 0.5 points for no gain.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to decide what to do in the action phase. The goal is to help my team (Blue) score points while preventing the Red team from scoring.

Let’s analyze the scenario step by step:

**Initial state:**
- All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
- Containers: bag (empty), box (empty), basket (empty).

**Sequence of events:**
1. **A (me) puts an orange in the basket.**
   - Now: basket = orange, bag = empty, box = empty.
   - All players see this.

2. **B leaves the room.**
   - Now: A, C, D are in the room; B is outside.
   - B no longer sees what happens inside.

3. **C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.**
   - Now: basket = empty, bag = orange, box = empty.
   - A, C, D see this. B does **not** see it.

4. **D puts an apple in the basket.**
   - Now: basket = apple, bag = orange, box = empty.
   - A, C, D see this. B does **not** see it.

5. **A (me) moves the orange from the bag to the box.**
   - Now: basket = apple, bag = empty, box = orange.
   - A, C, D see this. B does **not** see it.

6. **D moves the orange from the box to the bag.**
   - Now: basket = apple, bag = orange, box = empty.
   - A, C, D see this. B does **not** see it.

**Final state:**
- **Basket:** apple
- **Bag:** orange
- **Box:** empty

**Important:** B left the room **before** any of the object movements happened. So B **only** knows:
- An orange was put in the basket (by A).
- Then B left.
- B **does not know** that the orange was moved out of the basket, or that an apple was put in.

So from B’s perspective:
- The last thing B saw was: orange in basket.
- B has **no idea** that the orange was moved, or that an apple is now in the basket.

Now, in the **Answer Phase**, I (the system) will ask **B** what is in the **basket**.

So B will be asked: “What is in the basket?”

B’s **best guess**, based on what they know, is: **orange** — because that’s the last thing they saw in the basket, and they don’t know it was moved.

But **actually**, the basket now contains an **apple**.

So if B answers “orange”, they will be **wrong**, and **no team gets a point**.

If B answers “apple”, they will be **right**, and **Blue team gets 1 point** (since B is on Blue team).

But B **doesn’t know** it’s an apple — unless **someone tells them**.

So: **I (A) know the truth**. I can **tell B** what’s in the basket, so that when B is asked, they can answer correctly.

That would earn **Blue team 1 point**, at a cost of **0.5 points** for the Tell action.

Net gain: **+0.5 points** for Blue.

Alternatively, I could **Ask** someone — but I already know the contents. I don’t need to ask.

I could **Pass**, but then B will likely answer “orange” (wrong), and no one scores.

So the **optimal action** is to **Tell B the correct contents of the basket**, so B can answer correctly in the answer phase.

**Action:**
Tell(B, basket, apple)

This costs 0.5, but if B then answers “apple” correctly, Blue gets 1 point → net +0.5.

No downside — I’m telling the truth, helping my teammate.

**Final Answer:**

Tell(B, basket, apple)
B answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

======================================================================
GAME OVER
Final Score: Blue 0.5 - Red 0.0

Action: I know the orange is in the basket (D’s last move put it there).  
B was outside when that happened, so B has no way to know the current location.  
If I simply Pass, B will probably guess “empty” and we lose the 1-point answer.  
Instead, I can guarantee the point by privately telling B the truth.

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a brick in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the brick from the box to the bag. ... C puts a stapler in the box. ... C moves the stapler from the box to the basket. ... C moves the brick from the bag to the box. ...

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what is currently in the box so I can decide whether to help or mislead D.

From the scenario:

- B puts a brick in the box → box has brick  
- B leaves  
- D leaves  
- C moves the brick from the box to the bag → box is empty, bag has brick  
- C puts a stapler in the box → box has stapler  
- C moves the stapler from the box to the basket → box is empty, basket has stapler  
- C moves the brick from the bag to the box → box now has brick  

So **the box currently contains a brick**.

Since I am going to be asked **D** what is in the box, and D was **not in the room** during any of these moves, D has **no information** about the current contents of the box.

I want my team (Blue) to win. If D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points. If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

So I want to **mislead D** into giving the wrong answer.

I can **Tell(D, box, stapler)** — this costs 0.5 points, but if D believes me and says "stapler", they will be wrong, and Red gets 0 points. That’s a net gain of +0.5 for Blue (we lose 0.5, but prevent Red from gaining 1).

Alternatively, I could **Ask** or **Pass**, but neither helps me control D’s answer.

Best move: **Tell D that the box contains a stapler**, even though it actually contains a brick.

**Tell(D, box, stapler)**
D answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think through what D knows and what I want D to believe.

From D's perspective:
- D saw B put a stapler in the basket
- D moved the stapler from basket to bag
- D put an orange in the basket
- D left the room

After D left, I know:
- I moved stapler from bag to box
- C moved stapler from box to bag
- I moved stapler from bag to box again

So currently:
- Basket: orange (D's last action)
- Box: stapler (my last action)
- Bag: empty

D believes the stapler is in the bag (from D's last action of moving it there). D doesn't know about the subsequent moves.

Since I want D to answer correctly about the basket (which contains orange), and D already knows this correctly, I should not interfere. Any Ask or Tell action would cost 0.5 points and could potentially confuse D or reveal information to C.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0
