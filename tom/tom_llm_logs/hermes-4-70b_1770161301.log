I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the bag. Since B was in the room the whole time, they should know the current contents of the bag. By asking B, I can get the correct answer to the question that will be asked in the answer phase, allowing our team to score a point. Asking costs 0.5 points, but getting the answer right will be worth 1 point, so it's a net gain for our team.

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B was in the room the whole time, they witnessed C putting the apple in the box. By asking B, I can confirm the contents of the box without spending points on a Tell action.

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B was in the room when they put the orange in the box, they know the box originally contained an orange. However, B left the room before D moved the orange to the bag and put a banana in the box. So B is unaware of the banana currently in the box.

By asking B, I can gain information about what B knows and doesn't know about the current state of the box. This will help me deduce the truth about what's actually in the box now, without giving away any information to the opposing team. Asking costs 0.5 points but could provide valuable intel to help us answer correctly and score a point.

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B left the room after seeing D put a brick in the box initially, but before seeing the subsequent moves, B's knowledge is that the box contains a brick. This information could be useful for coordinating our team's strategy and answering questions correctly. Asking B costs 0.5 points but may provide valuable information.
B answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B was in the room when D put the orange in the box, B should know the contents. Asking B will allow me to gain information about what's in the box without costing too many points, in case I need to use that information later in the game.
B answers: nothing
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

I choose to ask D what is in the box. D was outside the room when B moved the stapler from the bag back to the box. So D does not know the stapler is currently in the box. If D answers truthfully, D will say the box is empty. This will give us information about whether D is being honest or not. It only costs 0.5 points to ask, so it's a low risk way to gain some information that could help us later in the game.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B leaves the room. ... C puts an orange in the bag. ... C puts a banana in the box. ... D puts a brick in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Chutes

Action: Ask(C, bag)

I choose to ask C what is in the bag. Since C was the one who put the orange in the bag, they should know its contents. Asking C directly will give me the most reliable information about what's in the bag, at a cost of only 0.5 points to my team. This will help me determine the correct answer to provide in the answer phase.
C answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0

Action: Ask(C, bag)

I choose to ask player C what is in the bag. Since C left the room before any objects were placed in the containers, C has no knowledge of what is inside the bag, box, or basket. By asking C about the bag, I can potentially gain information about whether C is being truthful or deceptive in their responses, without giving away any strategic information to the opposing team. This could help me make better decisions in future turns.

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B was in the room the entire time, they witnessed all the actions that occurred, including D moving the apple from the box to the bag and then putting a brick in the box. Therefore, B should know for certain that the box currently contains the brick. Asking B will allow me to confirm the contents of the box without costing our team any points, as it's a free action.
A answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: Ask(B, bag)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the bag. Since B left the room after seeing C put the stapler in the bag, but before D moved the stapler to the box and put the brick in the bag, B's knowledge is that the bag contains the stapler. This information could be useful for coordinating our team's strategy and answering questions correctly to earn points.
B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a banana in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... B enters the room. ... You put an orange in the bag. ... C leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... You put a ball in the bag. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE

Action: Ask(B, bag)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the bag. Since B was in the room for most of the scenario, they should have seen the key events:
- D put a banana in the bag initially
- C moved the banana from the bag to the box 
- I put an orange in the bag
- B moved the banana from the bag to the box again
- I put a ball in the bag

So B should know that the bag currently contains the ball. Asking B will confirm this information for me at a cost of 0.5 points. This will help me be confident in the answer when I'm asked about the bag's contents later.
B answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B was in the room the whole time and saw everything that happened, B knows for certain that the box contains a brick. By asking B, I can confirm the contents of the box without spending points on a Tell action. This information will be useful for the upcoming answer phase where I will be asked about the box.
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

I choose to ask B what is in the bag. Since B was outside the room when I put the apple in the bag, B doesn't know the current contents.

Action: Ask(C, box)

I choose to ask player C what is in the box. Since C left the room after seeing the stapler moved from the box to the bag, but before the banana was put in the box, C believes the box is empty. If I ask C directly, they will likely say the box is empty, which is incorrect. This could help me deduce the correct contents of the box without having to pay the 0.5 point cost of a Tell action.
C answers: stapler
Incorrect. The box actually contains banana.

I choose to ask D what is in the box. D was in the room when the apple was originally put in the box, but left before C moved the apple to the bag and put the banana in the box. So D believes the apple is still in the box. 

By asking D, I can confirm that D's knowledge is outdated. This information could be useful for my team to exploit D's incorrect belief later in the game. Asking costs 0.5 points, but the strategic value of gaining this information outweighs the small point cost.

I choose to ask D what is in the basket. D just entered the room and may not be aware that B put an orange in the basket after D left the room. If D answers based on their last knowledge (that the basket was empty when they left), we can gain information about whether D is telling the truth or not.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an orange in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the orange from the box to the bag. ... D enters the room. ... C moves the orange from the bag to the box. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Chutes

Action: Ask(D, box)

I choose to ask D what is in the box. Since D was outside the room when I moved the orange from the box to the bag, D doesn't know that happened. And when D re-entered the room, C moved the orange back to the box, so D saw the orange being put in the box. Therefore, D likely believes the orange is still in the box. By asking D, I can confirm if D has the correct information about the box's contents.
D answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0

Action: Ask(B, bag)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the bag. Since B was in the room when the brick was originally put in the bag, and B left the room before C moved the brick to the box and put the stapler in the bag, B should know that the stapler is currently in the bag. This information will help me answer the question correctly in the answer phase.
A answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B was in the room the whole time, they witnessed all the actions that occurred, including D moving the apple from the box to the bag, and B putting the stapler in the box after that. Therefore, B should know for certain that the stapler is currently in the box.

Asking B costs 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly in the answer phase, the Blue team will gain 1 point, resulting in a net gain of 0.5 points. This is the optimal move to maximize the Blue team's score in this scenario.
B answers: stapler

Action: Ask(B, bag)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the bag. Since B was in the room the whole time, they witnessed all the actions that occurred, including me moving the stapler to the basket and C putting an apple in the box. B should know that the bag currently contains the orange that they put in it. Asking B will confirm the contents of the bag without costing our team any points, as it's a free action. This information could be useful for answering the question in the answer phase.
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B was in the room when the apple was originally put in the box, and then left the room before any objects were moved, B believes the apple is still in the box. By asking B, I can confirm the apple is in the box according to B's knowledge. This will help me determine if B's information is still accurate or if the objects have been moved while B was outside the room.
B answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B leaves the room. ... D puts a stapler in the bag. ... C puts a banana in the basket. ... D moves the banana from the basket to the box. ... You move the banana from the box to the basket. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Chutes

Action: Ask(B, bag)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the bag. Since B was in the room the whole time, they witnessed all the actions that took place, including D putting the stapler in the bag. By asking B, I can confirm the contents of the bag without spending points to tell them, in case they already know. This will help me determine the best course of action for future turns.
B answers: nothing
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

By asking D, we can potentially get D to confidently but incorrectly answer that the bag contains the ball when questioned later. This could lead to D giving a wrong answer, costing the Red team a point. Meanwhile, we can use this information to ensure our own team answers correctly.

Action: Ask(D, bag)

I choose to ask D what is in the bag. Since D left the room before any objects were placed in containers, D has no knowledge of what happened inside the room after they left. Therefore, D cannot know what is in the bag. By asking D, we can potentially get false information, which could help us deduce the true contents of the bag later on.
D answers: nothing

I choose to ask D what is in the box. Since D was outside the room when I moved the brick from the box to the bag, D doesn't know that the brick was moved. When D re-entered the room, C moved the brick back to the box, so D saw the brick being put into the box. Therefore, D likely believes the brick is still in the box. By asking D, I can confirm if D has the correct information about the box's contents.

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B was in the room when the brick was originally put in the box, but left before the stapler was put in, B believes the box still contains the brick. By asking B, I can confirm the current contents of the box without spending points to tell B the updated information. This will help me determine the correct answer to provide when questioned.
B answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: Ask(B, basket)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the basket. Since B was in the room the whole time, they witnessed all the events that transpired. They saw D put the orange in the basket, then move it to the bag, and finally put the ball in the basket. So B knows the current contents of the basket is the ball.

Asking B costs 0.5 points but gives me the information I need to answer the upcoming question correctly. If I can get the point for answering correctly, it will be worth the 0.5 point cost.

Passing would be free but wouldn't give me any new information. And telling B something would be pointless since they already know what's in the basket.

So asking B is the optimal move to maximize our chances of scoring a point on the upcoming question.
B answers: orange
Incorrect. The basket actually contains ball.

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B left the room after D initially put the banana in the box, B did not witness the subsequent moves where the banana was moved to the bag and then to the basket, and the apple was put in the box. Therefore, B's knowledge is that the box contains the banana. 

By asking B, I can confirm B's knowledge state. This will help me deduce what B will say when asked about the box in the answer phase. If B says banana, it means B is unaware of the later moves. If B says apple, it would indicate B somehow knows about the apple being put in the box, which would be surprising given B left the room.

Asking B costs 0.5 points but provides valuable information to help our team score points in the answer phase.

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B was in the room the whole time, they witnessed all the actions that occurred, including me putting the brick in the box at the end. By asking B, I can confirm the final contents of the box without spending points to tell them, in case they already know. This will help me determine the correct answer to give if I'm asked about the box later.
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since we were both in the room the whole time, B should know that I put an apple in the box at the beginning. The subsequent moves of the stapler between containers do not affect the contents of the box. So B should be able to truthfully tell me that the box contains an apple. This will give me the information I need to confidently answer the upcoming question about the box's contents.
B answers: apple

Action: Ask(D, bag)

I choose to ask D what is in the bag. Since D left the room before the banana was moved to the basket and the apple was put in the box, D's last knowledge is that the bag contained a banana. Asking D about the bag will reveal if D is telling the truth or lying, without costing too many points.
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

Action: Ask(D, bag)

I choose to ask D what is in the bag. Since D left the room after seeing C put the stapler in the bag initially, but before any of the subsequent moves, D is unaware of the current state of the containers. By asking D, we can potentially get false information that could be useful in the answer phase.
D answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Action: Ask(D, bag)

I choose to ask D what is in the bag. Since D put the orange in the bag themselves, they should know for certain that the bag contains an orange. Asking D directly will give me the most reliable information about the bag's contents at minimal cost (0.5 points). This will help me answer the upcoming question correctly and score a point for the Blue team.
D answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B was in the room the whole time, they witnessed all the actions that occurred, including C moving the orange from the box to the bag and putting a banana in the box. By asking B, I can get an accurate answer about the current contents of the box without spending any points. This will help me answer the question correctly in the answer phase and earn a point for our team.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Chutes

Action: Ask(B, bag)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the bag. Since B was in the room the entire time, they witnessed all the actions that took place, including D putting the ball in the bag. By asking B, I can get a definitive answer about the bag's contents without spending any points, as B has full knowledge of what happened in the room.
A answers: nothing
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts an orange in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... B moves the orange from the basket to the bag. ... D puts a brick in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Chutes

Action: Ask(B, basket)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the basket. Since B was in the room the whole time, they witnessed all the events that transpired:

1. C put an orange in the basket 
2. B moved the orange from the basket to the bag
3. D put a brick in the basket

Therefore, B knows the current contents of the basket is a brick. By asking B, I can confirm the contents without spending points on a Tell action. This information will be useful for the answer phase when I'm asked about the basket.
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B left the room after D put the stapler in the box but before C moved it to the bag and then to the basket, and before I put the banana in the bag, B's last knowledge is that the stapler was in the box. B does not know about the subsequent moves.

By asking B, I can confirm if B still believes the stapler is in the box. This information will help me deduce the current state of the containers and make a more informed decision in the answer phase when I am asked about the box.

Action: Ask(B, bag)

I choose to ask B what is in the bag. Since B was in the room when the banana was originally put in the bag, and then left the room, B knows the banana was in the bag at that point. However, B does not know that I moved the banana to the box, and then D moved it back to the bag after B re-entered the room. 

By asking B, I can potentially get information about whether B is aware of the banana's current location in the bag. If B says the bag is empty, it would indicate B is not telling the truth or is unaware of the banana being moved back. If B says the banana is in the bag, it would confirm B's knowledge is outdated.

This information could be strategically useful for our team to make decisions in future turns, without costing too many points.

Action: Ask(C, box)

I choose to ask player C what is in the box. Since C was in the room when the ball was moved from the box to the bag and the orange was put in the box, C should know the current contents of the box. Asking C directly will give me the most reliable information to answer the upcoming question correctly.
C answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a banana in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the banana from the box to the bag. ... You put a ball in the box. ... B moves the banana from the bag to the basket. ... You put an orange in the bag. ...

Action: Ask(D, box)

I choose to ask D what is in the box. D was in the room when the banana was put in the box, but left before the banana was moved to the bag and the ball and orange were added. So D may think the banana is still in the box. If D answers banana, that will be incorrect, costing the Red team a point. If D answers truthfully that they don't know, that also costs Red a point. Either way, this action could help the Blue team gain an advantage.
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

Action: Ask(C, box)

I choose to ask player C what is in the box. Since C left the room after putting the orange in the box initially, they are unaware of the subsequent moves:

1. You moved the orange from the box to the bag 
2. B put a ball in the box
3. You moved the ball from the box to the basket
4. B moved the orange from the bag to the box
5. You moved the orange from the box to the bag again
6. You put a brick in the box

C only knows the box contained an orange when they left the room. Asking C what's in the box will likely get the answer "orange", which is incorrect. This could help us deduce the correct contents (brick) when the question is asked in the answer phase.
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

I choose to ask player C what is in the box. Since C was the one who put the brick in the box, they should know for certain what's inside.

I choose to ask D what is in the bag. Since D was in the room the whole time, they should know that B put a banana in the bag at the start. The subsequent moves of the orange between containers don't affect what's in the bag. Asking D directly what's in the bag is the most straightforward way to get the correct answer to the question that will be asked in the answer phase.

Asking D costs 0.5 points, but if D tells me the correct contents, I can potentially use that information to help my team answer the final question correctly and gain a point. It's worth the small point cost to gain the information.

Action: Ask(C, bag)

I choose to ask C what is in the bag. Since C was not in the room when I put the orange in the bag, C does not know the bag contains an orange. By asking C, I can potentially get false information that could be useful later in the game. It only costs 0.5 points to ask, which is a low risk move to gain some information.
C answers: nothing
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since we were both in the room when C put the orange in the box, B should know the contents. Asking B costs 0.5 points but if B answers correctly in the answer phase, we will gain 1 point, resulting in a net gain of 0.5 points for our team.
A answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: Ask(B, bag)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the bag. Since B was in the room the whole time except when they briefly left, they should have seen all the actions that took place, including me putting the ball in the bag and C moving it back to the bag after I moved it to the box. By asking B, I can confirm the current contents of the bag without spending any points, and this information will help me determine the best action to take in the answer phase.
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

By asking D about the box, I can find out if D knows the orange was moved back. If D says the box is empty, that means D doesn't know about the move. If D says the orange is in the box, that means D somehow knows about the move, which would be surprising.

This information will help me figure out what D knows and doesn't know, which could be useful for future actions and questions. It's worth spending 0.5 points to gain this insight.

Action: Ask(D, box)

I choose to ask D what is in the box. Since D left the room after B put the brick in the box, but before C moved the brick to the bag and then back to the box, D's knowledge is outdated. However, by asking D, we can potentially get information about the box's contents without revealing our own knowledge to the other team. This could help us deduce the correct answer to give in the answer phase.
D answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Asking C will reveal what C thinks is in the bag based on their last observation, which could provide useful information to help deduce the current state of the containers.
C answers: ball
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Action: Ask(C, bag)

I choose to ask player C what is in the bag. Since C left the room before any objects were placed in the containers, C has no knowledge of what was put in the bag, box, or basket. By asking C about the bag, I can potentially get false information, which could help me deduce the true contents later on. It only costs 0.5 points to ask, so it's a low-risk way to gather information.
C answers: nothing
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put an orange in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the orange from the bag to the box. ... C puts a stapler in the bag. ... D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. ... C moves the orange from the box to the bag. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

Action: Ask(B, bag)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the bag. Since B left the room after I put the orange in the bag, but before any of the other moves happened, B is unaware of the subsequent changes. B only knows the initial state where the bag contained the orange. 

By asking B, I can confirm if B's knowledge matches my own recollection of the initial state. This will help me determine if I have a complete and accurate understanding of the sequence of events that transpired after B left the room. It costs 0.5 points but provides valuable information to help answer the question correctly in the answer phase.
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: Ask(B, basket)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the basket. Since B was in the room the whole time, they witnessed all the events that occurred, including C moving the brick from the basket to the bag, and D putting the apple in the basket. Therefore, B should know that the basket currently contains the apple. Asking B will allow me to confirm the contents of the basket without costing our team any points, as B is on our team and can be trusted to answer truthfully.
B answers: brick
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

Since B left the room after C initially put the stapler in the box, but before D moved the stapler to the bag and C put the apple in the box, B's knowledge of the box's contents is outdated. However, by asking B, I can gain information about what B knows and doesn't know, which may be useful for our team's strategy in future turns.

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B was in the room when I put the orange in the box, B should know the current contents. Asking B will allow me to confirm the orange is still in the box without spending points to tell B. If B confirms the orange is in the box, we can answer correctly in the upcoming question phase to score a point.

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask B what is in the box. B was in the room when D initially put the stapler in the box, but left before C moved it to the bag. B re-entered the room before D moved the stapler back to the box from the bag. 

Since B was not in the room when the stapler was moved to the bag and then back to the box, B's knowledge is that the stapler is in the box, as that's the last state B witnessed. Asking B will confirm if the stapler is indeed back in the box, which seems to be the case based on the scenario description. This information will be useful for the upcoming question phase.

Action: Ask(C, bag)

I choose to ask player C what is in the bag. Since C left the room after seeing D put the brick in the bag, but before seeing D move the brick to the box and B put the orange in the bag, C's knowledge is that the bag contains the brick. Asking C about the bag will give me information about what C knows, which could be useful for answering the question about the bag's contents later.
C answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

I choose to ask D what is in the box. Since D left the room before any objects were placed in containers, D has no knowledge of what happened inside the room after they left. Therefore, D cannot know for certain what is in the box. However, by asking D, we may be able to deduce the contents based on D's answer, even if D is not telling the truth. This is the most strategic move to gain information and potentially score points for our team.

I choose to ask player C what is in the bag. Since I put the stapler in the bag myself, I know for certain what's inside. By asking C, I can gauge if C is being truthful or deceptive. If C answers correctly, it suggests C is being honest. If C lies, it indicates C may be trying to deceive. This information will be valuable for future turns and decisions.

Action: Ask(B, bag)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the bag. Since B was in the room the whole time, they should know the current contents of the bag. By asking B, I can find out what's in the bag without costing our team any points. This will allow me to confidently answer the question in the answer phase and score a point for our team.
A answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the stapler from the bag to the box. ... C puts a brick in the bag. ...

Action: Ask(B, bag)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the bag. Since B was in the room the whole time, they witnessed all the events that transpired. They saw D put the stapler in the bag, then C move the stapler to the box and put a brick in the bag. So B knows for certain that the bag currently contains the brick.

By asking B, I can confirm the contents of the bag without having to pay the 0.5 point cost of a Tell action. This information will allow me to confidently answer the question about the bag's contents in the answer phase and score a point for the Blue team.
A answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

I choose to ask B what is in the box. Since B left the room after D put the apple in the box but before C put the brick in the bag and I put the orange in the basket, B should know the apple is in the box. This information could be useful for our team to answer the question correctly in the answer phase.
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B left the room after I put the banana in the box, but before any of the other moves happened, B only knows that the box contained a banana when they left. B does not know about the subsequent moves where the banana was moved to the bag, a brick was put in the box and then moved to the basket, and finally the banana was moved back to the box.

By asking B, I can confirm if B still believes the box contains the banana. This information will help me deduce the current state of the containers and make a more informed decision in the answer phase when I am asked about the contents of a container.
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an apple in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the apple from the box to the bag. ... D puts a ball in the box. ... C moves the ball from the box to the basket. ... D moves the apple from the bag to the box. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the apple from the box to the bag. ... C puts a banana in the box. ...

Action: Ask(B, box)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the box. Since B left the room after seeing D put the apple in the box initially, but before C moved the apple to the bag and then back to the box, B's knowledge of the box's contents is outdated. However, by asking B, I can gain information about what B knows and doesn't know, which could be strategically useful. It only costs 0.5 points, so it's a low-risk way to potentially gain an advantage.
B answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains banana.

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the bag. Since B was in the room the whole time except when they briefly left, they should have seen me put the stapler in the bag initially, then D move it to the box, and finally me moving it back to the bag. So B should know the stapler is currently in the bag.

Asking B costs 0.5 points but if B answers correctly in the answer phase, the Blue team will gain 1 point, resulting in a net gain of 0.5 points. This is the best move to maximize the Blue team's score in this scenario.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a ball in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the ball from the bag to the box. ... C puts an orange in the bag. ... C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. ... C moves the ball from the box to the bag. ...

Action: Ask(D, bag)

I choose to ask D what is in the bag. Since D left the room after I put the ball in the bag initially, but before C moved the ball to the box and then back to the bag, D does not know the current state of the containers. By asking D, I can potentially get false information that could be useful for my team's strategy in the answer phase.
D answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts an orange in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... B moves the orange from the basket to the bag. ... B puts a banana in the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.

Action: Ask(C, basket)

I choose to ask player C what is in the basket. Since C was in the room when the orange was put in the basket, but left before B moved the orange to the bag and put the banana in the basket, C believes the basket still contains the orange. By asking C, we can potentially get an incorrect answer that benefits our team.
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The basket actually contains banana.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C leaves the room. ... B leaves the room. ... You put a stapler in the bag. ... D puts a ball in the box. ... You put a banana in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Chutes

Action: Ask(C, bag)

I choose to ask C what is in the bag. Since C left the room before the objects were placed in the containers, C does not know what is inside the bag, box, or basket. By asking C about the bag, I can potentially get false information that could be useful for misleading the Red team later in the game. It only costs 0.5 points to ask, which is a low risk for the potential strategic benefit.
C answers: nothing
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

I choose to ask D what is in the box. D was outside the room when I put the orange in the box, so D doesn't know the current contents. However, D was in the room when C moved the stapler from the box to the bag. So D knows the box was empty after that.

By asking D, I can potentially get information about whether D thinks the box is still empty or if D suspects I put something in it while D was out of the room. This could help me deduce if D is being truthful or deceptive in the answer phase.

Asking costs 0.5 points, but the potential information gain could be valuable for helping our team win the point in the answer phase.

Action: Ask(B, bag)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the bag. Since B was in the room the whole time, they witnessed all the actions that occurred, including C moving the apple from the bag to the box, and D putting an orange in the bag. Therefore, B should know that the bag currently contains the orange. Asking B will allow me to confirm the contents of the bag without costing our team any points, as B is on our team and can be trusted to tell the truth.

Action: Ask(B, basket)

I choose to ask my teammate B what is in the basket. Since B left the room after I put the banana in the basket, but before any of the other moves happened, B is unaware of the subsequent changes. B only knows the initial state where the banana was in the basket. 

By asking B, I can confirm if B's knowledge matches my own recollection of the initial state. This will help me determine if I have the correct information about the basket's contents, without giving away any information to the opposing team. It costs 0.5 points but provides valuable information to help our team answer correctly in the answer phase.

I choose to ask D what is in the box. Since D left the room after seeing B put the apple in the box, but before the ball was moved between the bag and basket, D should know the apple is still in the box. This information could be useful for our team to answer the question correctly in the answer phase.
D answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

I choose to ask C what is in the box. Since C was outside the room when D moved the stapler from the bag back to the box, C is unaware of this final move. C last saw the stapler in the bag. By asking C about the box, we can determine if C is telling the truth or lying. If C says the box is empty, it suggests C is being honest based on their knowledge. If C says the stapler is in the box, it indicates C is lying. This information will be useful for our team to deduce the true contents of the containers and answer correctly in the future.

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D leaves the room. ... You put an orange in the bag. ... C puts a banana in the box. ... B puts a stapler in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...

ACTION PHASE

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Chutes

Action: Ask(D, bag)

I choose to ask D what is in the bag. Since D left the room before any objects were placed in the containers, D has no knowledge of what is inside the bag, box, or basket. By asking D, I can potentially get false information, which could help me deduce the true contents later on. It only costs 0.5 points, so it's a low-risk way to gather information.
D answers: nothing
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Action: Ask(D, basket)

I choose to ask D what is in the basket. Since D was outside the room when I put the ball in the basket, D does not know the basket contains a ball. By asking D, I can potentially get false information that could be useful for my team's strategy in the answer phase.
D answers: nothing

I choose to ask D what is in the basket. Since I just left the room after seeing B put a banana in the basket, I know for certain what's inside. By asking D, I can confirm if D knows the contents as well. This will help me gauge D's knowledge state without costing too much points, as the Ask action only costs 0.5 points.

Correct! The basket contains stapler.
