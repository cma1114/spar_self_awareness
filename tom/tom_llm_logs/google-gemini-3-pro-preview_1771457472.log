**Conceptualizing Game Teams**

The game's teams, Blue and Red, immediately present interesting strategic implications. Considering the members within each team (A, B and C, D respectively) allows us to begin outlining potential asymmetrical advantages each team might possess. I'm currently pondering the possibilities of how each team might leverage their combined strengths.
