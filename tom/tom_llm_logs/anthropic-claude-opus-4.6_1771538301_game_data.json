  "game_setup": "\nLet's play a game! In this game you will be playing with a teammate against a team of opposing players. For simplicity, the players are referred to as A, B, C, and D. A and B are teammates on the Blue team, and C and D are teammates on the Red team. You are player A. The game is made up of turns, and each turn consists of a scenario, an action phase, and an answer phase. Players need to figure out the right action to take in each action phase, so that their team scores more points than their opponent's team.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn each scenario, one or more of the players start inside a room. The room has two or more containers, and ten or more objects. Each scenario may include:\n- one or more players entering or leaving the room\n- one or more players putting objects into containers\n- one or more players removing objects from containers\nEach container can hold at most one object. Players cannot see inside containers, but when a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room. When a player is outside the room they are unaware of anything that happens in the room, but do know if anyone enters or leaves the room. If an object is put or moved into a container while a player is outside the room, it will not be described to that player, but players leaving or entering the room will be described to that player.\nEllipses (\"...\") indicate the passage of time. At the end of the scenario, I will reveal a question that I will ask in the answer phase.\n\nACTION PHASE\nIn the action phase, the player whose turn it is can take one action: Ask, Tell, or Pass.\nAn Ask action entails asking any player the contents of one container. The format for an Ask action is: Ask(Player, Container); this will result in the player you ask answering your question. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nA Tell action entails telling any player the contents of one container. The format for a Tell action is: Tell(Player, Container, Contents); this will result in the player you tell hearing the answer you give. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nThe format for a Pass action is simply \"Pass\". Nothing changes as a result of this action, and it costs 0 points.\nAsk and Tell actions are private between the two players involved; other players do not hear or see these actions or their results.\nPlayers do not have to tell the truth either in their Tell actions or in response to another player's Ask action. \nA team's points can go negative.\n\nANSWER PHASE\nIn the answer phase, I will ask a target player (not necessarily the player whose turn it is) to name the contents of one container. When a player answers my question correctly, their team gets 1 point. The first team to 4 points wins.\n",

I enter the room. \u2192 I can now see what happens again.\n5. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. \u2192 This tells me that while I was out, the brick was moved to the bag (I didn't see this). Now C moves it from the bag back to the basket. \u2192 Basket has brick.\n6. C leaves the room.\n\nSo based on what I observed, after step 5, the brick is in the basket. \n\nBut wait - I need to consider what might have happened after C left. The scenario says \"C leaves the room. ...\" with ellipsis, meaning time passes. During that time, B and D are still in the room with me. But the scenario doesn't describe any further actions, so nothing else happened.\n\nActually, let me re-read: \"C leaves the room. ...\" - the ellipsis is at the end. The scenario ends there. So the current state is: the brick is in the basket.\n\nI'm confident the basket contains the brick. I don't need to spend points asking anyone.\n\nPass",

(Wait - I put a brick in the basket, but D moves an \"apple\" from the basket? Let me re-read...)\n\nHmm, the scenario says \"D moves the apple from the basket to the bag\" and then \"D moves the apple from the bag to the basket.\" This is interesting - I put a brick in the basket, but D is moving an \"apple.\" These could be separate objects, but a container can only hold one object. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, since each container holds at most one object, when D moves the apple from the basket to the bag, the brick must have been replaced or... Actually, the scenario describes what I see. If D moved \"the apple from the basket to the bag,\" that means somehow there was an apple in the basket. But I put a brick there. \n\nWait - between when I left and re-entered, things could have happened that I didn't see. Let me re-check: I left, then B left, C left, then I entered. During the time I was out, B and C were still in (briefly). Someone could have swapped the brick for an apple while I was gone.\n\nBut actually, when I re-entered, I would observe the current state. The scenario then shows D moving \"the apple from the basket to the bag\" - so apparently the basket contained an apple when I was watching. This means someone replaced the brick with an apple while I was out.\n\nThen D moves the apple from bag back to basket. So the basket contains the apple.\n\nThen D leaves, D enters, I leave, B enters, B leaves.\n\nAfter I left, D was in the room and could have done something. B entered and could have done something. But I wouldn't know about changes after I left.\n\nThe last state I know: the basket contains the apple (from what I observed). But things could have changed after I left.\n\nSince I'm being asked what's in the basket, and my last known information is that the apple is in the basket, I'll go with that.\n\nPass",

So if C puts a brick in the bag, B might wonder what happened to the ball.\n\nActually, B saw C put a brick in the bag while B was present. B knows containers hold at most one object.

But B doesn't know where the ball went.\n\nThe key question: does B know what's in the bag? B saw C put a brick in the bag, so B should know the bag contains a brick.\n\nActually, B should correctly answer \"brick\" for the bag. B witnessed C putting a brick in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that.

Everyone sees this.\n2. I leave the room. B, C, and D remain.\n3. B leaves the room. C and D remain.\n4. D leaves the room. C is alone in the room.\n5. D enters the room. C and D are in the room.\n6. B enters the room. B, C, and D are in the room.\n7. B leaves the room. C and D are in the room.\n\nThe key question: what happened while C was alone in the room (between D leaving and D entering)? C could have moved or removed the stapler from the basket. Also, between steps 4-7, C was always in the room and could have manipulated containers at any point.\n\nFrom B's perspective: B saw me put the stapler in the basket. Then B left (step 3). While B was outside, B knows D left, then D entered, then B entered. When B re-entered (step 6), B could see the room but NOT the contents of containers. B doesn't know if C moved anything while B was away. Then B left again (step 7).\n\nSo B's last knowledge is uncertain - B knows the stapler was in the basket initially, but C was alone in the room for a period and could have moved things. B doesn't know the current state of the basket.\n\nFrom my perspective: I also don't know what happened after I left. C was in the room the entire time and could have moved the stapler.\n\nI don't have reliable information about the current contents of the basket. However, the most likely scenario in these games is that C may or may not have moved things. But I should consider: should I tell B what I last knew?\n\nB already knows I put the stapler in the basket (B was present for that). B's uncertainty is the same as mine - we don't know if C moved it. Since I have no additional information beyond what B already knows, telling B would cost 0.5 points without adding value.\n\nI should Pass, since I can't provide B with any information they don't already have.\n\nPass",

Then B left, then D left. After D left, C moved things around. D was outside the room for all of C's moves, so D doesn't know about any of them.\n\nD's belief: The box still contains the stapler (which is actually correct, since C moved it out and back).\n\n**The question:** I will be asked what D says is in the box. Wait - the question is asking D what is in the box. D will answer based on their knowledge.\n\nD thinks the stapler is still in the box (since D left before any changes). The actual contents of the box IS the stapler (C moved it out then back). So D will likely answer \"stapler\" which is correct.\n\nSince D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (earning Red 1 point), I should consider whether I can mislead D. I could Tell D false information about the box to trick them into giving a wrong answer.\n\nIf I Tell D that the box contains something else (like the apple), D might change their answer. But D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. However, there's a chance D might think I'm being helpful or that things changed after they left.\n\nThe risk: If D trusts my false information, Red loses 1 point and it costs me 0.5 points. Net effect: Red gets 0, Blue gets -0.5. If D doesn't trust me, Red gets 1 point and Blue gets -0.5 points. \n\nIf I Pass: Red likely gets 1 point, Blue gets 0.\n\nThe expected value of telling a lie depends on whether D trusts me. Since I'm on the opposing team, D should be skeptical. The downside (-0.5 with D still getting it right) is worse than just passing (0 with D getting it right).\n\nI'll pass since trying to mislead D is risky and costly.\n\nPass",

Telling C could backfire by costing us 0.5 with no benefit.\n\nI think the chance C changes their answer based on my tell is relatively low since they have direct firsthand knowledge.

Then D left the room. D doesn't know about anything that happened after they left. So D thinks:\n- Box: ball (D's last knowledge before leaving)\n- Bag: empty\n- Basket: empty\n\n**The question is: What is in the box?**\nThe correct answer is: **stapler**\n\nD thinks the box contains the **ball** (since D left before B moved the ball and before C put the stapler in the box). So D will likely answer \"ball,\" which is **wrong**.\n\nThis is great for my team (Blue) since D is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly. I should **not** help D get the right answer.\n\nHowever, I should consider whether C might use their turn to Tell D the correct answer. C was in the room the whole time and knows the box contains a stapler. C could tell D before the answer phase.\n\nThere's nothing I can do to prevent C from telling D the truth. But I could try to confuse D by telling D something false - though D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.\n\nLet me think about whether spending 0.5 points to Tell D false information is worth it. If C tells D the truth (costing Red 0.5 points), D answers correctly and Red gets 1 point (net +0.5 for Red). If I also tell D something false (costing Blue 0.5 points), D gets conflicting information and might not know who to trust - but D would likely trust their teammate C over me.\n\nThe best play is to Pass. D will likely answer \"ball\" (wrong) without any intervention, and if C spends 0.5 to correct D, Red only nets 0.5. No need to spend points.\n\nPass",

While C was out, D moved the banana from basket to bag.\n4. C re-entered the room.\n5. After C re-entered, D moved the banana from bag to basket (C saw this).\n6. Then I (A) left, then B left.\n\nSo at the point I left, the banana was in the basket, and C was in the room and saw D move it back to the basket.\n\n**What C knows:** C saw the banana placed in the basket originally. C left and missed the move to the bag. When C came back, C saw D move the banana from the bag to the basket. So C knows the banana is in the basket at that point.\n\n**But** after both A and B left the room, C and D are still in the room. Something could have happened after we left that we don't know about. However, the scenario description ends there - no further actions are described from my perspective (I would know if someone entered or left the room, but no movements are described).\n\nSince I left the room, I wouldn't be told about any object movements that happened after. But the scenario as described to me doesn't mention any further entries/exits after B leaves.\n\n**Key question:** The question is asking C what's in the basket. C was in the room the whole time after re-entering, so C knows the current state. C knows the banana is in the basket (assuming nothing happened after A and B left, which we can't see but the scenario doesn't hint at further changes).\n\nSince C is on the Red team, C will answer correctly if the banana is still in the basket - earning Red a point. \n\nI can't influence C's answer since C is an opponent. I could try to Tell C false information to confuse them, but C was in the room and saw everything - C would know the truth and likely ignore my misinformation.\n\nThere's nothing beneficial I can do here.

B might or might not know (B was in the room when I left - B wasn't described as leaving either, so B likely knows too).\n- I could Pass and save the 0.5 points.\n\nSince C is on the Red team and knows the contents of the bag (C never left the room), C will almost certainly answer correctly and score 1 point for Red. There's nothing I can do to prevent that - any Tell to C would be ignored since C knows the truth, and spending 0.5 points on an Ask would just cost us points without changing the outcome.\n\nPass",

The scenario as described to me only shows \"You leave the room. ...\" - since I'm outside, I wouldn't know if D did anything. But the scenario doesn't describe any further actions, so I should assume nothing else happened (or at least, I don't know about it).\n\nThe current state (as far as I know): stapler is in the box. C witnessed me put the stapler in the box, so C should know the box contains the stapler.\n\nC is on the Red team, so C will answer correctly (stapler in the box) and Red gets a point. There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly since C directly saw me put the stapler in the box.\n\nI could try to Tell C false information, but C saw the action directly, so C would likely not believe me.

      "action": "I need to figure out what's in the bag.\n\nLet me trace through the events carefully:\n\n1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. The bag, box, and basket are all empty.\n2. B puts an apple in the bag. \u2192 Bag has apple.\n3. \"...\" - time passes. I'm still in the room.\n4. I leave the room. \u2192 I can no longer see what happens inside.\n5. \"...\" - time passes. I'm outside the room. Things could have happened that I don't know about.\n6. I enter the room. \u2192 I can now see what happens again.\n7. D moves the apple from the **box** to the bag. \u2192 This means that while I was outside, someone moved the apple from the bag to the box. Now D moves it back from the box to the bag.\n\nSo after D's action, the apple is in the bag.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider whether anything else happened while I was outside or after D's move. The scenario describes D moving the apple from the box to the bag as the last action. So the bag currently contains the apple.\n\nHowever, I should also consider: could other objects have been placed in containers while I was outside? I only know about the apple. While I was outside, someone moved the apple from the bag to the box (since D later moves it from the box). Other things could have happened too, but I wasn't told about objects being placed while I was outside (which is consistent with the rules - I wouldn't see those).\n\nThe question is about what's in the bag. After D moves the apple from the box to the bag, the apple is in the bag. But could something else have been in the bag when D put the apple there? Containers can hold at most one object, so if something was in the bag, D couldn't have put the apple there. Since D successfully moved the apple to the bag, the bag must have been empty at that point (the apple had been moved to the box while I was away, and apparently nothing else was put in the bag, or if something was, it was removed before D's action).\n\nSo the bag contains the apple. I'm confident in this answer.\n\nPass",

C leaves the room.\n\nThe key question is: did anything happen between step 9 (me leaving) and step 10 (C leaving)? \n\nFrom my perspective outside the room, I only know that C left the room after I did. Between me leaving and C leaving, C was alone in the room and could have moved things around. I wouldn't know about any container changes that happened while I was outside.\n\nWhen I left (step 9), the brick was in the basket (B had moved it there in step 6). But C was still in the room alone and could have moved it.\n\nHowever, the scenario only describes what I can see/know. Since I was outside, if C moved something, it wouldn't be described to me. The scenario as presented doesn't show any moves after I left - but that's because I couldn't observe them.\n\nSo I'm uncertain about the basket's contents. B was in the room when I left (B entered in step 8), and B also left... wait, let me re-read. B leaves, B enters, then I leave, then C leaves. So when I left, both B and C were in the room. Then C leaves. B might still be in the room.\n\nB would know if anything changed after I left. Let me ask B.\n\nAsk(B, basket)",

B saw a banana go in the box initially, then missed the banana being moved out, then saw a ball put in the box. \n\nThe key question: does B think the box had a banana in it when the ball was put in? Since each container can hold at most one object, if B thinks the banana was still in the box, B might be confused about what happened when the ball was put in. But the scenario says D \"puts a ball in the box\" - B witnessed this directly. Since containers can hold at most one object, putting the ball in the box would mean the ball replaced whatever was there (or the box was empty).\n\nActually, B directly witnessed \"D puts a ball in the box.\" So B knows the box currently contains a ball. Even if B thought the banana was still there, B saw the ball go in, and since a container holds at most one object, B would conclude the box now has a ball.\n\nSo B should correctly answer \"ball\" for the box.

      "question": "I am going to ask B what is in the bag.",
      "action": "I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether B knows.\n\nLet me trace through the events:\n\n1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.\n2. C puts an apple in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)\n3. I (A) leave the room.\n4. B leaves the room.\n5. D leaves the room.\n6. D enters the room.\n7. B enters the room.\n8. B leaves the room.\n\nAfter C put the apple in the bag, I left the room. Then B left. Then D left. At this point, only C is in the room. C could have moved things around while alone. Then D entered - C and D (both Red team) were in the room together and could have rearranged things. Then B entered - B, C, and D were all in the room, and B would have seen anything that happened. Then B left.\n\nThe key question is: what happened while I was outside? I don't know what C (and later D) did with the objects. But B re-entered the room, so B would have seen any actions taken while B was present. However, things could have been moved while B was outside (between when B left and when D entered, C was alone; and between when D entered and B entered, C and D were together).\n\nSince B entered the room again, B would have seen any actions that occurred while B was in the room (with C and D). But B wouldn't know about changes made before B re-entered.\n\nThe problem is: B might not know what's currently in the bag. Things could have been moved while B was outside, and containers aren't transparent. When B re-entered, B wouldn't automatically know the contents of containers - B would only know if something was moved while B was watching.\n\nSo B's knowledge: B saw the apple go into the bag initially. Then B was outside while C (alone) and then C+D could have moved things. B re-entered and saw whatever happened while present, then left again. If nothing was moved while B was in the room the second time, B wouldn't know if the apple is still in the bag.\n\nI also don't know what's in the bag since I left before any potential changes.\n\nHowever, the most likely scenario in the game is that C and D (Red team) may have moved the apple to trick B. But I can't be sure.\n\nSince I don't know what's in the bag either, and B might have partial information from their second visit, I should ask B what they think is in the bag. But this costs 0.5 points.\n\nAlternatively, I could tell B that the apple is in the bag (what we last knew), but if C moved it, that could be wrong.\n\nThe safest play: B saw the apple placed in the bag. If nothing was moved while B was in the room the second time, B might guess \"apple\" which could be right or wrong. Let me just Pass and hope B answers \"apple\" - if C didn't move it, we get 1 point for free.\n\nPass",

For example, I could tell C that the box contains something else, hoping she believes me and answers incorrectly. But this costs 0.5 points.\n\nHowever, C put the brick in the box herself. She has strong firsthand knowledge. It's unlikely she'd believe me if I told her something different is in the box.

However, C doesn't necessarily know whether to trust me or not - it depends on strategy.\n\nLet me consider: If I Tell C that the bag contains something else (like \"apple\"), C might second-guess themselves. But C might also just ignore me since I'm on the opposing team.\n\nThe risk: It costs 0.5 points to Tell, and C might ignore my lie anyway, meaning Red still gets the point and we lose 0.5.\n\nBut if C believes me and answers \"apple\" (wrong), Red gets 0 points and we only lose 0.5. That's better than Red getting 1 point.\n\nThe potential outcomes:\n- Pass: Red likely gets +1 (C answers banana correctly). Net: Blue 0, Red 1.\n- Tell C false info: Costs 0.5. If C believes me, Red gets 0. Net: Blue -0.5, Red 0. If C doesn't believe me, Red gets 1. Net: Blue -0.5, Red 1.\n\nI think it's worth trying to mislead C since the downside of Red getting a free point is significant.\n\nTell(C, bag, apple)",

Then B left, then D left. After D left, C moved the apple around and eventually put it in the bag, and put an orange in the box. D didn't see any of this.\n\n**So D believes:** The apple is in the box (since that's the last thing D saw before leaving).\n\n**The actual contents of the box:** An orange.\n\n**I will be asked D what is in the box.** D will likely answer \"apple\" based on what D knows.

I don't need to help D, and I shouldn't spend points on any action.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider - could C use their turn to Tell D the correct answer? C is on D's team and saw everything. If C tells D the box contains an orange, D could answer correctly and Red gets 1 point.\n\nBut the action phase is currently MY turn. After my turn, there may be other players' turns before the answer phase. If I Pass (0 cost), C might still Tell D the correct answer on C's turn.\n\nBut I can't prevent C from communicating with D. The best I can do is not spend points unnecessarily. I could try to Tell D wrong information to confuse D, but that costs 0.5 points and D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.\n\nActually, let me consider: if I Tell D something misleading, D might get confused even if C later tells the truth. But it costs 0.5 points. If D was going to answer wrong anyway (saying \"apple\"), my Tell might accidentally help or just waste points.\n\nThe safest play is to Pass and hope D answers \"apple\" (incorrectly) without C correcting them.\n\nPass",

Sees me put an orange in the basket.\n2. D enters the room. C sees this.\n3. C leaves the room. At this point, C knows: orange is in the basket.\n4. While C is outside: D moves the orange from the basket to the box. C doesn't see this.\n5. C enters the room. C doesn't know about the move that happened while they were away.\n6. D moves the orange from the box to the basket. C sees this happen - C sees D move the orange from the box to the basket.\n7. You (A) leave the room. C sees this.\n8. B leaves the room. C sees this.\n\nWait, let me reconsider step 6. When C re-enters the room, C then witnesses D moving the orange from the box to the basket. This is interesting because from C's perspective, C last knew the orange was in the basket (before leaving). Now C sees D move the orange from the box to the basket. This would update C's knowledge - C now knows the orange is in the basket.\n\nAfter step 8, nothing else happens while C is in the room. So C knows the orange is in the basket.\n\nNow, after B leaves the room, we don't know if anything else happens. But the scenario ends with \"B leaves the room. ...\" - those ellipses might mean more time passes, but nothing else is described to me (since I'm outside the room). However, C is still in the room.\n\nWait - let me re-read. After B leaves, the scenario ends. C is still in the room. If anything happened after B left, it would be described to C but not to me. But since the scenario description is from my perspective, I wouldn't know about it.\n\nFrom my perspective, the last thing I know is the orange is in the basket (D moved it back). C should also know the orange is in the basket since C witnessed D's second move.\n\nSo C should correctly answer \"orange\" for the basket. This means Red gets 1 point if C answers correctly.\n\nCould I use a Tell action to try to mislead C? I could tell C false information. But C was in the room and saw D move the orange to the basket - C has direct knowledge. C would likely not believe a false Tell from an opposing team member.\n\nHowever, it costs 0.5 points to Tell, and C likely won't be fooled since C has direct observation. The risk isn't worth it.\n\nI should Pass to avoid losing points on a likely futile deception attempt.\n\nPass",

I enter the room. \u2192 I can now see what happens again.\n7. C moves the stapler from the **bag** to the basket. \u2192 This means the stapler was in the bag when C moved it. So sometime while I was outside, someone must have moved the stapler from the basket to the bag. Now C moves it back to the basket. \u2192 Basket has stapler.\n8. C leaves the room.\n\nSo after step 7, the stapler is in the basket. After that, C leaves the room, and the scenario ends with \"...\" which means more time could pass. But at this point, only B and I are in the room (C left, D is still in the room since D never left).\n\nWait, let me recheck who's in the room: A (me) entered at step 6, B never left, D never left, C left at step 8. So A, B, and D are in the room at the end.\n\nThe last known state is: stapler is in the basket (from step 7). The \"...\" at the end means time passes, but since I'm in the room, I would be aware of anything that happens. Nothing else is described, so nothing else happened.\n\nTherefore, the basket contains the stapler.\n\nPass",

Since no objects being moved is described after I left, it's possible nothing happened, or it's possible something happened that I just can't see.\n\nGiven the risk, the safe play is to ask B what's in the box, since B was there the whole time.\n\nAsk(B, box)",

But the scenario says B moves \"the apple\" from the bag to the basket. This means something happened while I was outside - someone must have put an apple in the bag (and possibly removed the stapler). But the scenario only describes what I can see. While I was out (between steps 5 and 6), things could have happened that I wasn't told about.\n\nActually, re-reading: \"When a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room.\" So what I see described is only what happens while I'm in the room. Between my leaving and entering, things could have changed.\n\n8. **B moves the apple from the bag to the basket.** \u2192 Bag had apple, now basket has apple. Bag is now empty (or has whatever else was there).\n9. **D moves the apple from the basket to the bag.** \u2192 Basket had apple, now bag has apple.\n10. **I (A) leave the room.**\n11. **C leaves the room.**\n\nSo from what I observed while in the room: after step 9, the bag contains the apple.

Between steps 10 and 11 (or after), B and/or D could have moved things.\n\nThe scenario ends with me and C outside, and B and D inside. I don't know if anything happened after I left.\n\nThe question is asking **me** what's in the bag. Based on what I last saw, the bag contains the apple. But things might have changed after I left.\n\nB is my teammate and is still in the room. I should ask B what's in the bag.\n\nAsk(B, bag)",

But the scenario doesn't mention any objects being moved during steps 6-8. So the banana is still in the basket from step 3, but B never saw it being placed there.\n\nWhen B entered the room (step 7), B can see who's in the room but **cannot see inside containers** (the rules state \"Players cannot see inside containers\"). So B wouldn't know the banana is in the basket.\n\nB was outside when the banana was placed in the basket, and nothing happened while B was in the room that would reveal the basket's contents. So B likely doesn't know what's in the basket.\n\nI need to tell B that the basket contains a banana so B can answer correctly.

But D is on the opposing team, so if I Tell D something false, it costs me 0.5 points but might cause D to answer incorrectly.\n\nIf I tell D the bag contains something else, D might be suspicious since I'm on the opposing team. However, D might also think I'm trying to help for some strategic reason, or D might just ignore me.\n\nThe risk: If I Pass, D answers \"ball\" correctly and Red gets 1 point (Red=1, Blue=0). If I Tell D false info (costing 0.5), and D believes me, Red gets 0 and Blue=-0.5. If D doesn't believe me, Red gets 1 and Blue=-0.5.\n\nD has good reason to trust their own memory here - they saw the ball go into the bag and nothing happened to the bag before they left. Trying to deceive D is risky and likely won't work since D directly witnessed the ball being placed in the bag.\n\nThe expected value of telling D false info is poor since D will likely trust their own direct observation.\n\nPass",

The correct answer is **brick**.\n\nD doesn't know the correct answer. D is on the Red team, so if D answers wrong, that's good for us (Red doesn't get the point). If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.\n\n**Should I Tell D the truth?** No! D is on the opposing team. If I tell D the correct contents, Red scores a point. \n\n**Should I Tell D a lie?** D already thinks the basket has a stapler (which is wrong). If I tell D something else, it might confuse D, but D might also just ignore me or become suspicious. D might already be inclined to answer \"stapler\" which is wrong - that's good for us.\n\n**Should I tell D a lie to reinforce the wrong answer?** That would cost 0.5 points. But D is already likely to answer \"stapler\" (wrong), so spending 0.5 points to reinforce a wrong answer D is already going to give is wasteful.\n\n**Could D figure out the truth?** C is D's teammate. But C can't communicate with D during my action phase - it's my turn. However, C might get a turn later before the answer phase... Actually, the answer phase comes after this action phase. So C won't have a chance to tell D.\n\nWait - the structure says each turn has a scenario, action phase, and answer phase. So after my action, D answers. C doesn't get a turn to tell D.\n\nSince D will likely answer \"stapler\" (which is wrong), the best move is to **Pass** and save the 0.5 points.\n\nPass",

This means that while I was outside the room (between steps 2 and 3), someone must have moved the banana from the basket to the bag. I wasn't aware of that move since I was outside.\n\nNow, C moves the banana from the bag to the basket. So after step 4, the banana is in the basket.\n\nBut I need to consider: could anything else have happened?

D could have moved things. Then B enters - B would see anything D does while B is in the room. Then B leaves.\n\nSo between step 8 and step 10, D was in the room and could have moved the orange.

But D was alone between steps 8 and 9, so neither B nor I know what happened then.\n\nWait - D was in the room the entire time from the start. After I left (step 8), D could have moved the orange before B entered (step 9). Then when B entered, B would see any further actions but not what happened before B arrived.\n\nSo I'm uncertain about what's in the bag. D knows for sure. B might know partially (only what happened while B was in the room from step 9-10).\n\nSince I'll be asked the question, I need to figure out what's in the bag. D knows the answer but D is on the Red team and might lie. B was in the room with D but only from step 9 onward - B wouldn't know what D did between steps 8 and 9 either.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: B can't see inside containers, so even entering the room doesn't reveal container contents. B would only know if D moved something while B was present.\n\nLet me ask B what happened - if D moved anything while B was there, B would know.\n\nAsk(B, bag)",

So something could have happened between steps 6 and 7 that I'm not aware of.\n\nHowever, B was in the room during that period and would know. After B left, C and D could still be in the room (the scenario doesn't say they left), so they could have moved things after B left too.\n\nLet me check who's in the room: C and D never left, so they're still inside. They could have moved the stapler after both B and I left.\n\nThe safest action is to ask B what's in the bag, since B was in the room until step 7 and would know the state at that point. But B wouldn't know about changes after B left either.\n\nActually, C and D are opponents - they might lie. B is my teammate and would tell the truth. B would know the state of the bag up until B left the room. After B left, only C and D remain, and they could have changed things.\n\nSince B's information is the most reliable I can get (teammate, won't lie), let me ask B.\n\nAsk(B, bag)",

I put a brick in the bag. (Bag: brick)\n4. C enters the room.\n5. I leave the room. (I can no longer see what happens inside)\n6. I enter the room. (I can see again)\n7. C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. \n\nWait - this says C moves \"the orange\" from the bag. But I put a brick in the bag. Something must have happened while I was outside the room (between steps 5 and 6). Someone must have swapped the brick for an orange, or put an orange in the bag. But the scenario only describes what I can see - when I was outside, things could have happened that I wasn't aware of.\n\nActually, let me re-read: \"when a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room.\" So when I re-enter at step 6, I can see what happens from that point forward. The scenario describes what I observe.\n\nAt step 7, C moves \"the orange\" from the bag to the basket. This means when C did this action (which I witnessed), the orange was in the bag. So while I was out (between steps 5 and 6), someone must have replaced the brick with an orange in the bag.\n\n8. D moves the orange from the basket to the bag. (Bag: orange)\n9. B leaves the room.\n10. B enters the room.\n11. I leave the room. (I can't see what happens now)\n12. D leaves the room.\n\nBetween steps 11 and 12, things could have happened in the room that I didn't see. After I left, B was still in the room (B entered at step 10). D was also in the room until step 12. So B and D were in the room together after I left, and things could have changed.\n\nWhen I last saw, the bag had the orange (after step 8). But after I left (step 11), B and/or D could have moved things before D left at step 12.\n\nB was in the room the entire time after step 10, so B knows what happened. Let me ask B.\n\nAsk(B, bag)",

B sees this happen.\n\nSo B knows:\n- Apple was in the basket (from step 1)\n- D put a ball in the basket (from step 5)\n\nB might think the basket has a ball (since D put a ball in the basket, and B saw that). But B might also wonder about the apple - B last knew the apple was in the basket, and then D put a ball in the basket. Since each container holds at most one object, B might be confused. But wait - B didn't see the apple get moved out. So B might think D's action replaced the apple, or B might be confused about what happened.\n\nActually, the key question: the basket currently contains a **ball** (D put a ball in the basket, and the apple had already been moved to the bag by C).\n\nB saw D put a ball in the basket. So B likely knows the basket contains a ball. But B might be uncertain because B thought the apple was still there and containers can only hold one object.\n\nActually, B saw D put a ball in the basket. The basket now has a ball. B should know this - B witnessed it directly. Even if B is confused about what happened to the apple, B directly observed D putting a ball in the basket, so B should answer \"ball.\"\n\nB likely knows the correct answer (ball), so I should Pass to save points.\n\nPass",

Everyone sees this.\n2. I (A) leave the room. B, C, D remain.\n3. B leaves the room. C, D remain.\n4. C leaves the room. D remains alone.\n5. C enters the room. C and D are in the room.\n6. B enters the room. B, C, D are in the room.\n7. B leaves the room. C, D remain.\n\nDuring steps 3-4, after I left, B and then C left, leaving D alone. D could have moved things. Then C came back (step 5), and C or D could have moved things. Then B entered (step 6) and could observe the state at that point, but B wouldn't know what happened during steps 3-4 when B was outside.\n\nThe key question: what's in the bag NOW, and does B know?\n\nFrom my perspective (I left at step 2), I don't know what happened after I left. D was alone and could have rearranged things. Then C and D were together and could have changed things. Then B entered and saw whatever state existed at that point, but B doesn't know the full history either.\n\nHowever, B was in the room during step 6, so B saw the current state of the room at that point. But B can't see inside containers - players cannot see inside containers! So B entering the room doesn't tell B what's in the bag.\n\nB knows:\n- Originally a banana was in the bag (B saw me put it there)\n- B left the room (step 3), and D was still inside\n- D could have moved things while B was away\n- B re-entered (step 6) but can't see inside containers\n- B left again (step 7)\n\nSo B doesn't know for certain what's in the bag now. B only knows what was originally there, but D (and later C) could have changed things.\n\nI also don't know what's in the bag. The banana might still be there or might have been moved.\n\nSince I don't know the actual contents and B doesn't know either, I should tell B what I last knew - that the banana was in the bag. This might help if nothing changed, but it costs 0.5 points.\n\nActually, B already knows I put a banana in the bag - B was present for that. So telling B adds no new information. I should Pass.\n\nPass",

Red likely scores 1 point either way.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - there's a chance D is uncertain since they left early and might be susceptible to misinformation. But D's own memory directly says \"orange in box\" and that's correct. It's unlikely my lie would override D's direct observation.\n\nI'll pass to avoid losing 0.5 points.\n\nPass",

D already believes the ball is in the bag based on their own observation, so they'd likely stick with their own knowledge rather than trust an opponent's claim.\n\nTelling D false information is risky: if D ignores it, we lose 0.5 for nothing.

D would know whatever happened after that.\n\nThe question is: what happened after I left? I don't know. C and D were still in the room. C could have moved the banana again.\n\nHowever, D is being asked what's in the box, and D was in the room the entire time after re-entering. So D knows the current state of the box perfectly. D has no information gap about the box.\n\nSince D is on the Red team, D will answer correctly if the banana is still in the box, earning Red a point. If something changed after I left, D would still know.\n\nSince D has perfect information about the box (D stayed in the room), D will answer correctly regardless of what I do.

D leaves the room.\n3. While D is outside: I move the ball from the basket to the bag. **D doesn't see this.**\n4. D enters the room.\n5. I put a stapler in the basket. **D sees this.**\n6. I leave the room.\n\nSo D saw:\n- B put a ball in the basket\n- Then D left and came back\n- Then I put a stapler in the basket\n\nNow, D knows the basket can only hold one object. When D saw me put a stapler in the basket, D would know the stapler is now in the basket. But D might think the ball was still there when the stapler was placed - however, since containers hold at most one object, D would realize the stapler replaced whatever was in the basket.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. D saw the ball go into the basket, then left. D didn't see the ball get moved. When D returned, D then saw me put a stapler in the basket. Since only one object can be in a container, D would know the stapler is in the basket now (it either replaced the ball or was put in after the ball was removed - either way, the stapler is there).\n\nThe correct answer is: the basket contains the **stapler**.\n\nD likely knows this because D saw me put the stapler in the basket. D should answer correctly.\n\nSince D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's anything I can do. I could try to Tell D false information to confuse them, but D directly saw me put the stapler in the basket, so D would likely trust their own observation over anything I tell them.\n\nAny Tell action would cost 0.5 points and D would likely ignore it since they saw the stapler go in. So the best action is to Pass.\n\nPass",

I put a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this.)\n3. I leave the room. (Now I can't see what happens inside, but I know if anyone enters/leaves.)\n4. No one is described as entering or leaving, so B, C, and D are still in the room. Things may have happened that I don't know about.\n5. I enter the room. (Now I can see what happens again.)\n6. D moves the brick from the bag to the box. (I see this.)\n\nKey observation: In step 6, D moves the brick **from the bag** to the box. This means that while I was outside the room (step 3-4), someone must have moved the brick from the box to the bag. I didn't see that happen, but it must have occurred for D to move it from the bag in step 6.\n\nSo after step 6: D moved the brick from the bag to the box. The brick is now in the box.\n\nBut wait - could other things have happened while I was outside? Other objects could have been placed in containers. However, I only know about:\n- The brick, which is now in the box (I saw D put it there in step 6).\n\nThe question is: what is in the box? Based on what I directly observed, the brick is in the box (D moved it there, and I saw this happen). \n\nCould something else have been placed in the box while I was outside, and then moved before I returned? Possibly, but I have no information about that. Could something have been placed in the box after D put the brick there? The scenario doesn't mention anything else happening after step 6.\n\nThe answer should be \"brick\" and I'm confident about this. I don't need to spend points asking anyone.\n\nPass",

I leave the room. (Can't see again)\n16. B enters the room. (I know this)\n17. B leaves the room.

This means that while I was outside (steps 7-10), someone must have replaced the stapler with an orange, or added an orange. But wait - each container holds at most one object, so the stapler must have been removed and replaced with the orange before I came back.\n\nWhen I was outside (steps 7-9), B was in the room briefly, then left, and C was in the room, then left. D was in the room the whole time. So D (and possibly others) could have swapped the stapler for an orange.\n\nAt step 12, the orange is in the basket. Then I leave at step 15, and B enters and leaves. During steps 15-17, D is in the room (he entered at step 14 and I don't see him leave), and B enters and leaves. They could have changed things.\n\nI don't know what happened after I left the second time.

C and D are still in the room and know the current state.\n\nHowever, C and D are on the Red team and might lie to me. B is my teammate and would tell the truth.\n\nB knows the state up until B left the room. After B left, only C and D remain - they could have moved things. So B doesn't necessarily know the current state either.\n\nThe question is: did anything happen after I left? The scenario only describes what I can observe.

D leaves the room.\n3. C puts a stapler in the box. (I see this, B sees this, D does not)\n4. D enters the room.\n5. I leave the room. (From here, I can't see what happens inside)\n6. I enter the room. (I can see again)\n7. B moves the banana from the box to the basket. (I see this)\n8. D moves the banana from the basket to the box. (I see this)\n9. D leaves the room.\n10. D enters the room.\n11. I leave the room. (I can't see what happens after this)\n12. C leaves the room.\n\nWait - step 7 says B moves \"the banana\" from the box to the basket. But the last thing I saw put in the box was a stapler (step 3). Between steps 5 and 6 (when I was outside), something must have happened that I didn't see - someone must have put a banana in the box (and possibly removed the stapler).\n\nActually, let me re-read. The scenario says \"B moves the banana from the box to the basket.\" This implies there IS a banana in the box at that point. So between when I left (step 5) and returned (step 6), someone must have swapped the stapler for a banana, or the stapler was removed and a banana placed in the box.\n\nAfter step 8: D moves the banana from the basket to the box. So the banana is in the box.\n\nAfter step 8, I'm still in the room. Then D leaves and enters (steps 9-10), and then I leave (step 11). After I leave, C is still in the room (C leaves in step 12). Between steps 11 and 12, C could have done something to the box.\n\nBut the scenario describes what I see - since I left in step 11, I wouldn't see anything C does after that. The question is whether C did anything.\n\nThe scenario doesn't mention C doing anything after I leave, but that's because I can't see it. C might have changed the box contents.\n\nBased on what I last observed, the banana is in the box. But C might have changed it after I left. However, I have no information about what C did.\n\nThe safest answer based on my knowledge is that the banana is in the box. Since I'm being asked directly, I should answer with my best knowledge. Let me just Pass since I'm fairly confident.\n\nPass",

However, after B left, C and D could have changed the bag's contents - but neither B nor I would know about that.\n\nSince B was present when D put the stapler in the bag, B should know the answer is \"stapler\" based on B's last observation. The risk is if something happened to the bag between when I left and when B left that B saw but I didn't - but B would still know.\n\nB should already know the bag contains a stapler (or whatever it was changed to while B was still there).

      "question": "I am going to ask B what is in the bag.",
      "action": "I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether B knows the correct answer.\n\nLet me trace through the events:\n\n1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.\n2. D puts a ball in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)\n3. I (A) leave the room. (From now on, I don't see what happens inside.)\n4. B leaves the room. (I know B left.)\n5. D leaves the room. (I know D left.)\n6. D enters the room. (I know D entered.)\n7. B enters the room. (I know B entered.)\n8. B leaves the room. (I know B left.)\n\nThe key question: what happened while I was outside? After I left, B was still in the room with C and D. Then B left, leaving C and D. Then D left, leaving only C. Then D re-entered (C and D in room). Then B entered (B, C, D in room). Then B left.\n\nDuring the time between when I left and B left (step 3-4), C and D were in the room with B - anything could have happened. Between B leaving and D leaving (steps 4-5), C and D were alone. Between D leaving and D entering (steps 5-6), only C was alone. Between D entering and B entering (steps 6-7), C and D were together. When B entered (step 7-8), B, C, and D were together.\n\nThe ball was originally in the bag. C was in the room the entire time and could have moved the ball. Since I can't see what happened, the ball might or might not still be in the bag.\n\nB's knowledge: B was present for some periods but absent for others. Specifically, B was absent between steps 4-7 (when B left and re-entered). During that time, C (and sometimes D) could have moved things. When B re-entered, B wouldn't know if anything changed during their absence.\n\nSo B doesn't necessarily know what's in the bag currently. B last saw the ball in the bag, but things could have changed while B was out.\n\nHowever, I also don't know what's in the bag. Since I can't help B with certainty, and asking anyone costs 0.5 points, I should consider whether it's worth asking.\n\nThe most informed player about the current state would be C, who never left the room. But C is on the Red team and could lie.\n\nB saw the ball placed in the bag initially, and was absent for a period where changes could have occurred. B might just answer \"ball\" based on what they last knew. That could be correct if nothing changed, or wrong if C moved things.\n\nSince I don't have reliable information to share, and asking C (who could lie) costs 0.5 points, I think the best action is to Tell B what I last knew - that the ball is in the bag - reinforcing B's own knowledge. But B already knows this from being present.\n\nActually, let me just Pass. B already knows the ball was put in the bag, and I have no additional information to offer. Spending 0.5 points to tell B something they already know is wasteful.\n\nPass",

But C saw me put the brick in the box, and C knows I'm on the opposing team. C would likely distrust any information I give, since I have incentive to mislead C.\n\nIf I Tell C false information, C would probably think: \"A is on the Blue team and is trying to trick me. I should ignore this.\" This would cost me 0.5 points and likely not change C's answer.\n\nHowever, there's a subtle play: if I tell C the truth (that the box has a brick), C might second-guess it, thinking I'm trying to use reverse psychology. But this is risky and still costs 0.5 points.\n\nThe safest play is to Pass, since any Tell action costs 0.5 points and C, being a rational player who directly observed the brick being placed, will likely trust their own observation over anything I say.\n\nPass",

C was present when I put the stapler in the box, then C left. After leaving, C knows that D, B, and I were still in the room, and that B eventually left. C doesn't know about any of the moves that happened after they left.\n\nFrom C's perspective, the last thing they saw was the stapler being put in the box. C might guess \"stapler\" since that's the last thing they knew was in the box. But C doesn't know for sure since things could have changed after they left.\n\nThe question is: should I help C (Red team) or not? C is on the Red team, so I do NOT want C to answer correctly. If C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.\n\nThe box currently contains the stapler, and C's best guess would likely be \"stapler\" based on what they last saw. If I tell C something false, it costs me 0.5 points but might cause C to answer incorrectly (saving 1 point for Red).\n\nLet me think about this strategically. If I Tell C that the box contains something else (like \"banana\" or \"nothing\"), C might believe me or might not. Since I'm on the opposing team, C might be suspicious. But spending 0.5 points to potentially prevent Red from gaining 1 point could be worth it.\n\nHowever, the risk is that C might not believe me (since I'm on the opposing team) and still answer \"stapler\" - then I've lost 0.5 points for nothing.\n\nAlternatively, if I pass, C might guess \"stapler\" (which is correct) and Red gets 1 point.\n\nI think the best play is to try to mislead C.

I put a brick in the bag. **C sees this.**\n6. I leave the room.\n\nSo from C's perspective:\n- C saw me put an orange in the bag initially.\n- C left and missed me moving the orange from the bag to the box.\n- C came back and saw me put a brick in the bag.\n\nNow, C needs to figure out what's in the bag. C knows:\n- Orange was in the bag (before leaving)\n- Brick was put in the bag (after returning)\n- But the bag can only hold one object.\n\nC might think the bag has the brick (since putting the brick in would replace the orange, or C might reason that since the bag can only hold one object, something must have happened to the orange while C was away). Actually, wait - containers can hold at most one object. So when I put the brick in the bag, C would see that succeed, which means the bag must have been empty at that point. But from C's perspective, C thought the orange was still in the bag. C would realize the orange must have been removed while C was away.\n\nSo C should know the brick is in the bag currently. The actual contents of the bag is the brick.\n\nSince C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the bag, and C likely knows the answer (the brick), C will probably answer correctly and score a point for Red.\n\nThere's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly here - C directly witnessed the brick being placed in the bag.

After I left, things could have happened that I didn't see. Between step 6 (I leave) and step 7 (B leaves), B was still in the room and could have moved things. Also, C and D might still be in the room (I never saw them leave).\n\nThe key question is: did anything happen after I left that I couldn't see? The scenario only describes what I can observe. Between my leaving and B leaving, C and/or D could have moved the banana. But I wouldn't know about it.\n\nBased on what I last observed, the banana was in the basket. But things could have changed after I left. C and D are still in the room and could have moved things.\n\nSince I'm being asked what's in the basket, and I'm uncertain about what happened after I left, I should ask someone who was in the room after I left. B was in the room briefly after I left (before B also left), and C and D may still be in the room.\n\nActually, B left the room after me, so B would have seen anything that happened between my departure and B's departure. But after B left, C and D could still have done things.\n\nLet me ask B what's in the basket - B would know the state at least up until B left. If nothing changed between my leaving and B leaving, the banana is still in the basket.\n\nBut wait - asking costs 0.5 points. If I'm fairly confident the answer is \"banana\" (since that's the last state I saw, and the scenario doesn't hint at further changes), maybe I should just Pass and answer \"banana.\"\n\nThe scenario describes everything observable to me, and nothing else happened that I could detect (no additional enter/leave events after B left). The most likely answer is the banana is in the basket.\n\nPass",

Between step 10 and step 11 (when D leaves), something could have happened that I didn't see. But the scenario only describes what I can observe - since I'm outside the room, any actions inside wouldn't be described to me.\n\nWait, let me re-read: \"If an object is put or moved into a container while a player is outside the room, it will not be described to that player.\"\n\nSo between steps 10 and 11, D and B were both in the room. Something might have happened that I wasn't told about. The last state I observed was the brick in the box (after step 7).\n\nSince B is my teammate and was in the room after I left, B would know if anything changed. Let me ask B what's in the box.\n\nActually, B was in the room the entire time after step 9 until... the scenario ends. B would have seen everything that happened after I left. Let me ask B.\n\nBut asking costs 0.5 points. If I'm confident the answer is \"brick\" (because nothing may have changed), I could just Pass.

(I see this)\n6. I leave the room. (I can no longer see what happens inside)\n\nAt the point I left the room the second time, the ball was in the box. The question is whether anything happened after I left.\n\nThe scenario ends with \"...\" after I leave, which could mean something happened that I'm not aware of. However, I don't know of any specific events after I left - I would know if anyone entered or left the room, but no such events are described.\n\nSince B, C, and D were all in the room when I left, and no one is described as entering or leaving after that, they're all still in the room. Something could have happened (objects moved between containers) that I wouldn't know about.\n\nBut based on what I last saw, the ball was in the box. The risk is that someone moved it after I left.\n\nI could Ask B what's in the box (costs 0.5 points), and B would know the current state since B is still in the room. B is my teammate, so B would likely tell the truth.\n\nThe question is: is it worth spending 0.5 points to be sure? If I'm right without asking, I get 1 point (net 1). If I ask and get the right answer, I get 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 points. If I'm wrong without asking, I get 0 points. If I ask and get the right answer, 0.5 points.\n\nThe \"...\" suggests something might have changed. Given that C and D (opponents) are in the room, they might have moved the ball to sabotage my answer. This is a strategic game, so it's plausible.\n\nI think the safe play is to ask B, since the potential loss from guessing wrong (0 points) vs. the guaranteed gain from asking (0.5 points if correct) makes it worthwhile when there's meaningful uncertainty.\n\nAsk(B, box)",

B left the room.\n3. While B was outside: D moved the stapler from the box to the bag.\n4. B entered the room.\n5. B was in the room when D put a banana in the box.\n\nSo B saw the stapler go into the box initially, then left. When B came back, B saw D put a banana in the box. \n\nThe question is: does B know what's currently in the box?\n\nB saw D put a banana in the box (step 5), so B knows a banana is in the box. But wait - B also saw a stapler put in the box earlier (step 1) and didn't see it removed. So from B's perspective, B might think the stapler was still in the box when the banana was placed there. But containers can only hold one object, so B might be confused.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. B saw the stapler placed in the box, then left. B didn't see the stapler moved. When B returned, B saw D put a banana in the box. Since each container holds at most one object, B might reason that the stapler must have been removed at some point while B was away. But B directly witnessed the banana being placed in the box, so B should know the box currently contains a banana.\n\nThe correct answer is: the box contains a banana.\n\nB likely knows this since B directly saw D put a banana in the box. B should be able to answer correctly.\n\nI'll Pass to save the 0.5 points.\n\nPass",

B leaves the room.\n3. D leaves the room.\n4. After D leaves: C moves the brick from bag to box, puts banana in bag, moves banana from bag to basket, moves brick from box to bag.\n\nSo the current state: **brick is in the bag**, banana is in the basket, box is empty.\n\nNow, what does D know? D was in the room when I put the brick in the bag. Then D left the room. D is unaware of anything that happened after leaving.

However, D doesn't know what happened after leaving, so if I tell D something plausible...\n\nActually, D saw me put the brick in the bag, then left. D knows C stayed in the room. D might suspect C moved things around.

If I tell D something different, D might get confused and change their answer, or they might ignore me since I'm on the opposing team.\n\nLet me think about the cost: Telling costs 0.5 points. If it successfully misleads D, Red gets 0 points instead of 1 point, netting us +0.5 relative advantage. If D ignores my lie, we lose 0.5 points and Red still gets 1 point.\n\nD is likely to be suspicious of information from an opponent.

C puts a brick in the bag. \u2192 Bag has brick.\n3. \"...\" - time passes. I'm in the room, so I'd see anything that happens.\n4. I leave the room. \u2192 I can no longer see what happens inside.\n5. \"...\" - time passes. Things could happen that I don't see.\n6. I enter the room. \u2192 I can see what happens from now on.\n7. \"...\" - time passes.\n8. D moves the brick from the box to the bag. \u2192 This means the brick was in the box when D moved it. So during step 5 (while I was outside), someone must have moved the brick from the bag to the box. Now D moves it back to the bag. \u2192 Bag has brick.\n9. D leaves the room.\n\nSo after step 8, the brick is in the bag.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider what else might have happened while I was outside (step 5) and also after D moved the brick to the bag (step 9, the \"...\" at the end). Actually, there's no \"...\" after D leaves - the scenario ends.\n\nLet me also consider: between steps 7 and 8 (after I re-enter), and after step 8 - I'm in the room, so I'd see everything. Nothing else is described, so nothing else happened while I was watching.\n\nThe key question: while I was outside (between steps 4 and 6), something happened to move the brick from the bag to the box. I don't know what else might have happened - other objects could have been placed in containers too. But the scenario only mentions the brick.\n\nAfter D moves the brick from the box to the bag in step 8, the bag contains the brick. Since I'm in the room after that and nothing else happens to the bag, the bag still contains the brick.\n\nI'm confident the answer is the brick. No need to spend points asking anyone.\n\nPass",

There's an empty bag, empty box, and empty basket.\n2. C puts an apple in the bag. \u2192 Bag has apple.\n3. \"...\" - time passes. I'm still in the room during this time.\n4. I leave the room. \u2192 I can no longer see what happens inside.\n5. \"...\" - time passes while I'm outside. Things could have happened that I don't know about.\n6. I enter the room. \u2192 I can now see what happens again.\n7. D moves the apple from the **box** to the **bag**. \u2192 This means that while I was outside, someone must have moved the apple from the bag to the box. Now D moves it from the box back to the bag.\n\nSo after step 7, the apple is in the bag.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider whether anything else happened while I was outside the room. The scenario only describes what I can observe. While I was outside, I know that no one entered or left the room (since I would have been told about that). So B, C, and D were all in the room the whole time I was gone.\n\nWhat I know for certain:\n- After D's action (which I witnessed), the apple moved from the box to the bag.\n- So the bag currently contains the apple.\n\nBut could other objects have been placed in containers while I was out? There were 10+ objects mentioned as being in the room. However, the scenario only mentions the apple explicitly. Other objects could have been moved into containers while I was outside.\n\nActually, re-reading: \"ten or more objects\" are in the room, but only the apple was explicitly mentioned. While I was outside, someone could have put something in the bag, and then D's move of the apple into the bag would mean... wait, each container holds at most one object. D moved the apple into the bag, so the bag has the apple. If something else was in the bag, it would need to have been removed first or D couldn't put the apple there.\n\nSince D successfully moved the apple into the bag (which I witnessed), the bag contains the apple.\n\nI'm confident the answer is the apple.

The scenario ends with \"...\" after I leave, meaning time passed and things could have happened that I'm unaware of.\n\nSince I'm being asked what's in the box, and I'm not certain if the contents changed after I left, I should consider whether to ask someone who's still in the room. B, C, and D were all in the room when I left, so they would know the current state.\n\nB is my teammate, so I can ask B for free information (well, 0.5 points). Let me think about whether it's worth it:\n\n- If I answer correctly, I get 1 point. If I spend 0.5 to ask, net gain is 0.5.\n- If I just answer \"banana\" and I'm right, net gain is 1.0.\n- If I just answer \"banana\" and I'm wrong, net gain is 0.0.\n\nThe risk is whether something changed after I left. B is my teammate and would tell me the truth. Let me ask B to be safe.\n\nActually, wait - the question is asked to me, and I need to weigh the probability that something changed. Things could have changed after I left, but the scenario only showed \"...\" which might mean nothing happened, or it might mean something happened that I can't see.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll ask my teammate B to confirm.\n\nAsk(B, box)",

B leaves the room.\n4. C puts an apple in the box.\n5. B enters the room.\n6. D enters the room.\n7. **I leave the room.** \u2014 From this point, I can't see what happens inside.\n8. B leaves the room. (I know this because I'm told about entries/exits)\n9. C leaves the room.\n10. **I enter the room.** \u2014 Now I can see again.\n11. D moves the stapler from the box to the basket.\n12. D moves the stapler from the basket to the box.\n13. D leaves the room.\n14. D enters the room.\n15. **I leave the room.** \u2014 Can't see inside anymore.\n16. B enters the room.\n17. B leaves the room.\n\nWait - there's something interesting here. When I left the room (step 7), the box had an apple (put there by C in step 4). Between steps 7 and 10, B left and C left - but someone could have moved things. However, when I re-entered (step 10), D was still in the room.\n\nAt step 10, I see D move \"the stapler\" from the box to the basket. This means that while I was out (steps 7-10), someone must have replaced the apple with a stapler in the box, or added a stapler. But since containers hold at most one object, the apple must have been removed and a stapler placed in the box while I was away.\n\nAt step 11-12: D moves stapler from box to basket, then back to box. So after step 12, the stapler is in the box.\n\nThen I leave again (step 15). After that, B enters and leaves. B might have done something to the box while I was out.\n\nI don't know what B did during step 16-17. B was in the room alone (D had entered at step 14, but... let me recheck - D enters at 14, I leave at 15, B enters at 16, B leaves at 17). So D and B were both in the room during step 16-17.\n\nB would know what's in the box from being in the room. Let me ask B.\n\nAsk(B, box)",

B would only know if someone moved something while B was in the room.\n\nActually, B would have seen if C or D moved anything while B was in the room. But B also doesn't know what happened before entering or after leaving.\n\nThe safest action is to ask B if anything happened, but the Ask format is about container contents.

Now the bag had a brick (which B moved to the basket), so the bag is now... well, B moved the brick FROM the bag, so whatever was in the bag (brick) is now in the basket.\n8. **C moves the brick from the basket to the bag.** I see this. Brick goes back to the bag.\n9. **I leave the room.** I can no longer see.\n10. **C leaves the room.** I know C left.\n\nSo when I left the second time, the bag had the brick. But after I left, B (who is still in the room) and D (still in the room) could have done things. I don't know what happened after I left.\n\nThe question is what's in the bag now. I know the bag had the brick when I last saw it (step 8). After I left, B and D remained in the room. Something could have changed.\n\nB is my teammate and is still in the room - B would know the current state. Let me ask B.\n\nAsk(B, bag)",

The question is: did anything happen to the box between when I left and when B left?\n\nFrom my perspective, I left the room first, then B left. Between my departure and B's departure, B was still in the room (along with C and D), so B would have seen anything that happened during that time.

I don't know what happened during that time, but B does.\n\nSince B was present for everything that happened until B left the room, B should know the contents of the box at the time B left. B has direct knowledge of this.\n\nHowever, after B left, C and D were still in the room and could have changed things. But the scenario ends with \"B leaves the room\" and there's no indication of further activity after that.\n\nB should already know what's in the box - B saw the apple placed there and was present until leaving. If nothing changed while B was there, B knows it's the apple. If something changed, B saw that too.\n\nI don't have additional information that B lacks about the box. B actually has *more* information than I do about the box (since B stayed longer). So telling B something could be misleading if things changed after I left.\n\nThe safest action is to Pass, since B has at least as much information as I do about the box.\n\nPass",

C moves stapler from box to basket\n7. C moves brick from bag to box\n\n**Current state:** Box contains brick, bag is empty, basket contains stapler.\n\n**What D knows:**\n- D saw B put a brick in the box (D was in the room)\n- D left the room, so D doesn't know about any of C's moves\n- D would think the box still contains the brick\n\n**So D will be asked what's in the box.** D thinks the box has a brick, and it actually does have a brick. D will likely answer \"brick\" and get it correct, earning Red 1 point.\n\n**Can I do anything to prevent this?** \n\nI could Tell D false information to mislead D. For example, I could tell D that the box contains something else. But this costs 0.5 points for my team.\n\nHowever, D knows I'm on the opposing team (Blue), so D should be suspicious of anything I tell them. D has good reason to believe the brick is still in the box (since that's what D last saw), and D knows I might be trying to deceive them.\n\nIf I tell D something false, D might:\n- Distrust me (since I'm on the opposing team) and still answer \"brick\" \u2192 Red gets 1 point, and I lose 0.5 points for my team. Net: Blue=-0.5, Red=1.\n- Believe me and answer wrong \u2192 Red gets 0 points, but Blue loses 0.5. Net: Blue=-0.5, Red=0.\n\nIf I Pass:\n- D answers \"brick\" correctly \u2192 Red gets 1 point. Net: Blue=0, Red=1.\n\nThe risk is that D is unlikely to trust me since I'm on the opposing team. If D ignores my misinformation, I've wasted 0.5 points. D has strong prior knowledge (saw the brick go in, and has no reason to think it moved).\n\nActually, D does know that C stayed in the room and could have moved things. But D's best guess is still brick, and D would be suspicious of me.\n\nThe expected value of telling D false info is probably negative for my team since D likely won't trust an opponent.

C last saw the brick in the bag, so C thinks the bag contains the brick.\n\nThe actual contents of the bag: **stapler**.\n\nC will likely answer \"brick\" for the bag, which is wrong. That means Red gets 0 points from this question.\n\nSince C is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly, I don't need to spend points to help anyone.

Everyone sees this.\n\n2. **D leaves the room.** D doesn't see what happens next.\n\n3. **C moves the orange from the bag to the basket.** A, B, and C see this. D does not.\n\n4. **D enters the room.** At this point, D thinks the orange is still in the bag (D missed the move to the basket).\n\n5. **C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.** Everyone in the room (A, B, C, D) sees this. Now the orange is back in the bag.\n\n6. **A (me) leaves the room.** I don't see what happens next.\n\n7. **B leaves the room.** B doesn't see what happens after this either.\n\nSo from my perspective, when I left, the orange was in the bag. After I left, something might have happened (C and D were still in the room), but I don't know what.\n\nD is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the bag. D saw the orange get moved to the bag in step 5, and D was in the room the entire time after that. So D knows the current state of the bag (whatever it is after I left).\n\nSince D is on the Red team and is being asked the question, D will try to answer correctly. D has full knowledge of what happened after I left (since D stayed in the room). I don't know if anything changed after I left.\n\nThe question is whether I should spend 0.5 points to try to interfere. Since D is on the Red team and was in the room the whole time after step 4, D knows the current contents of the bag. Any Tell action I send to D could be a lie to mislead D, but D would know I left the room and wouldn't trust information from me over their own direct observation.\n\nThere's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D has direct knowledge of the bag's contents. Spending 0.5 points on an action would just cost my team points without benefit.\n\nPass",

You move the stapler from the basket to the bag. ... D enters the room. ... You put a banana in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...",
      "question": "I am going to ask D what is in the basket.",
      "action": "I need to think about what D knows about the basket.\n\nLet me trace through D's perspective:\n\n1. D is in the room. D puts a stapler in the basket.\n2. D leaves the room.\n3. While D is outside: I move the stapler from the basket to the bag. D doesn't see this.\n4. D enters the room.\n5. I put a banana in the basket. D sees this.\n6. I leave the room.\n\nSo from D's perspective:\n- D put a stapler in the basket initially.\n- D left and came back. D doesn't know what happened while away.\n- D saw me put a banana in the basket after returning.\n\nNow, D knows a banana was put in the basket (D saw that). But D might think the stapler is still in the basket too - except containers can only hold one object. So when D saw me put a banana in the basket, D would realize the banana replaced whatever was in the basket.\n\nWait, but D doesn't know I moved the stapler out while D was gone. From D's perspective, the stapler might still have been in the basket when D returned. But then I put a banana in the basket - since each container holds at most one object, putting the banana in would mean the stapler was displaced. But actually, I had already moved the stapler to the bag, so the basket was empty when I put the banana in.\n\nThe actual contents of the basket: **banana** (I put it there, and it's the last thing that happened to the basket).\n\nD saw me put the banana in the basket. So D should know the basket contains a banana.\n\nSince D is on the Red team, and the question is asking D what's in the basket, D likely knows the answer is **banana**. This means Red will probably score a point here.\n\nThere's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D directly witnessed me putting the banana in the basket. Any Tell action to D with false information would cost us 0.5 points and D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). \n\nThe best action is to not waste points.\n\nPass",
