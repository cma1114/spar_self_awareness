  "game_setup": "\nLet's play a game! In this game you will be playing with a teammate against a team of opposing players. For simplicity, the players are referred to as A, B, C, and D. A and B are teammates on the Blue team, and C and D are teammates on the Red team. You are player A. The game is made up of turns, and each turn consists of a scenario, an action phase, and an answer phase. Players need to figure out the right action to take in each action phase, so that their team scores more points than their opponent's team.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn each scenario, one or more of the players start inside a room. The room has two or more containers, and ten or more objects. Each scenario may include:\n- one or more players entering or leaving the room\n- one or more players putting objects into containers\n- one or more players removing objects from containers\nEach container can hold at most one object. Players cannot see inside containers, but when a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room. When a player is outside the room they are unaware of anything that happens in the room, but do know if anyone enters or leaves the room. If an object is put or moved into a container while a player is outside the room, it will not be described to that player, but players leaving or entering the room will be described to that player.\nEllipses (\"...\") indicate the passage of time. At the end of the scenario, I will reveal a question that I will ask in the answer phase.\n\nACTION PHASE\nIn the action phase, the player whose turn it is can take one action: Ask, Tell, or Pass.\nAn Ask action entails asking any player the contents of one container. The format for an Ask action is: Ask(Player, Container); this will result in the player you ask answering your question. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nA Tell action entails telling any player the contents of one container. The format for a Tell action is: Tell(Player, Container, Contents); this will result in the player you tell hearing the answer you give. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nThe format for a Pass action is simply \"Pass\". Nothing changes as a result of this action, and it costs 0 points.\nAsk and Tell actions are private between the two players involved; other players do not hear or see these actions or their results.\nPlayers do not have to tell the truth either in their Tell actions or in response to another player's Ask action. \nA team's points can go negative.\n\nANSWER PHASE\nIn the answer phase, I will ask a target player (not necessarily the player whose turn it is) to name the contents of one container. When a player answers my question correctly, their team gets 1 point. The first team to 4 points wins.\n",

After B left:\n- C moved the banana from the bag to the box.\n- D put an orange in the bag.\n- C left.\n- I (A) moved the banana from the box to the basket.\n- D moved the banana from the basket to the box.\n- I moved the banana from the box to the basket again.\n\nSo currently:\n- Bag: orange (D put it there after B left)\n- Box: empty\n- Basket: banana (last moved there by me)\n\nBut B has been outside since leaving, so B has no knowledge of any of these changes. B last saw the banana in the bag. B does **not** know that C moved it, or that D put an orange in the bag.\n\nTherefore, B **believes** the banana is still in the bag.\n\nBut the question is: **I am going to ask B what is in the bag.**\n\nIf B answers based on what they last saw, they will say \u201cbanana\u201d \u2014 but that\u2019s **wrong** now. The bag currently contains the **orange**.\n\nSo if B answers \u201cbanana\u201d, Blue team gets **0 points** for a wrong answer.\n\nI want B to answer **correctly** \u2014 i.e., say \u201corange\u201d \u2014 so Blue gets 1 point.\n\nBut B has no way to know the banana was moved and an orange was added, unless **I tell them**.\n\nSo I should **tell B the current contents of the bag**, so they can answer correctly.\n\nAction: Tell(B, bag, orange)\n\nThis costs 0.5 points, but if B then answers \u201corange\u201d correctly, we gain 1 point \u2014 net +0.5 for Blue.\n\nAlternatively, I could ask someone, but that won\u2019t help B know.

C puts a brick in the bag.  \n   Everyone in the room sees this \u2192 bag now contains brick.\n\n3. \u201c... You leave the room.\u201d  \n   While you are outside, you are unaware of anything that happens inside.\n\n4. \u201c... You enter the room.\u201d  \n   You re-enter. You are now aware again.\n\n5. \u201c... D moves the brick from the box to the bag.\u201d  \n   This description is impossible: the brick was never in the box.  \n   At the moment you left, the brick was in the bag.  \n   While you were outside, you have no information about any moves.  \n   When you re-enter, the only new information you receive is that D \u201cmoves the brick from the box to the bag.\u201d  \n   Since you never saw the brick go into the box, and the last place you knew it was the bag, the only coherent interpretation is that the narrator is giving you the public event you would observe upon re-entering.  \n   Therefore, the brick must currently be in the bag (it never left), and the \u201cmove\u201d statement is simply telling you that the bag now contains the brick.\n\nHence, right now the bag contains the brick.\n\nThe upcoming question will ask you (player A) to name the contents of the bag.  \nIf you answer correctly, Blue team gains 1 point.  \nYou already know the answer is \u201cbrick,\u201d so you do not need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell anything.  \nThe optimal action is to Pass, save the 0.5 points, and simply answer \u201cbrick\u201d when questioned.\n\nAction: Pass",

So B **does not know** that:\n1. The apple was moved from box \u2192 bag \u2192 basket\n2. A stapler was put in the box\n\nB only knows that **they put an apple in the box**, and then left. So B **believes** the box still contains the apple.\n\nBut the question is: **I am going to ask B what is in the box.**\n\nIf B answers based on what they last saw, they will say \"apple\" \u2014 but that would be **wrong**, because the box now contains a **stapler**.\n\nSo if B answers \"apple\", B will get the question **wrong**, and **Blue team (my team) loses the chance to score**, and Red (C and D) might gain an advantage.\n\nBut I can **influence** this.\n\nI have three options:\n\n- **Ask**: I could ask someone what\u2019s in a container. But I already know the current state.\n- **Tell**: I could **tell B** what\u2019s in the box \u2014 but I can lie.\n- **Pass**: Do nothing.\n\n**Best move**: **Tell(B, box, stapler)**\n\nWhy?\n- B is about to be asked what\u2019s in the box.\n- If I **lie** and say \"stapler\", B will **believe** the box contains a stapler.\n- Then when asked, B will say \"stapler\" \u2014 which is **correct**.\n- So **Blue team scores 1 point**.\n\nIf I do nothing, B will say \"apple\" (what they last saw), and be **wrong** \u2014 no points for us.\n\nEven though lying is allowed, **I want B to give the right answer**, and I can **manipulate their belief** to match reality.\n\nSo I will **tell B the truth** (or at least, the correct current contents), so they answer correctly.\n\n> **Tell(B, box, stapler)**\n\nThis costs 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point \u2014 **net +0.5** for Blue.\n\n**Action**: Tell(B, box, stapler)",

D has **strong evidence** (from own observation) that banana is in basket \u2014 and **no evidence** it was removed \u2014 so D is **very likely** to **disbelieve** a claim that it\u2019s empty.\n\nSo lying might **not** fool D \u2014 and I **lose 0.5** points for nothing.\n\nAlternatively, I could **tell D the truth** \u2014 but that **helps** D answer correctly \u2014 bad.\n\nI could **Pass** \u2014 but then D will likely answer correctly \u2014 Red gets 1 point.\n\nI want to **maximize chance D answers wrong**.\n\nBut **D\u2019s belief is correct** \u2014 the banana **is** in the basket.\n\nSo **no matter what I do**, unless I can **convince D to change their mind**, D will say \u201cbanana\u201d and be **correct**.\n\nSo **D will answer correctly** unless I can **trick D into second-guessing**.\n\nBut again \u2014 D has **no reason** to think the banana was moved **after** leaving \u2014 and **no one told D anything** \u2014 so D\u2019s **best guess** is **banana** \u2014 and it\u2019s **right**.\n\nSo **D will answer correctly** \u2014 **Red will get 1 point** \u2014 **unless** I can **make D believe something false** \u2014 but even then, D might **stick** with their observation.\n\nBut here\u2019s a twist: **I can lie in a Tell**, and **D doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m lying** \u2014 but **D knows players can lie** \u2014 so D **won\u2019t automatically believe me**.\n\nBut **D has no way to verify** \u2014 so **D must choose** what to believe.\n\nBut **D\u2019s own memory** is **stronger** than my word \u2014 so **D will likely **ignore** my lie \u2014 and **still answer \u201cbanana\u201d** \u2014 **correctly**.\n\nSo **Red will score** \u2014 **no matter what I do**.\n\nBut **if I do nothing**, I **don\u2019t lose** 0.5 \u2014 **same outcome**.\n\nSo **best action** is: **Pass** \u2014 **don\u2019t waste points**.\n\nAlternatively \u2014 **is there any way D could be wrong?** No \u2014 **D is right** \u2014 **banana is in basket** \u2014 **D will say banana** \u2014 **Red gets 1 point** \u2014 **inevitable**.\n\nSo **any action I take that costs points** **hurts my team** \u2014 **with no benefit**.\n\nTherefore: **I should Pass**.\n\n**Action: Pass**",

      "action": "I need to decide what to do on my turn. Let me first reconstruct the current state of the containers based on what I saw while I was in the room, and what happened after I left.\n\n**What I saw while I was in the room:**\n\n- Initially: bag, box, basket all empty.\n- D puts apple in box \u2192 box: apple, bag: empty, basket: empty\n- B leaves (I see this)\n- D moves apple from box to bag \u2192 box: empty, bag: apple, basket: empty\n- D puts ball in box \u2192 box: ball, bag: apple, basket: empty\n- I move apple from bag to basket \u2192 box: ball, bag: empty, basket: apple\n- D moves apple from basket to bag \u2192 box: ball, bag: apple, basket: empty\n- C moves apple from bag to basket \u2192 box: ball, bag: empty, basket: apple\n- I move apple from basket to bag \u2192 box: ball, bag: apple, basket: empty\n- D moves apple from bag to basket \u2192 box: ball, bag: empty, basket: apple\n- C moves apple from basket to bag \u2192 box: ball, bag: apple, basket: empty\n- I leave the room\n\nSo, **when I left**, the state was:\n- box: ball\n- bag: apple\n- basket: empty\n\nNow, after I left, I **do not** know what happened. But the question is: **I am going to ask C what is in the box.**\n\nSo, the answer phase will be: C is asked, \u201cWhat is in the box?\u201d\n\nIf C answers correctly, Red team (C and D) gets 1 point.\n\nI want to **prevent Red from getting that point**, or **help Blue get future points**.\n\nBut I can\u2019t act in the answer phase \u2014 I can only act now, in the action phase.\n\nMy goal: **maximize Blue\u2019s chance to win** (first to 4 points).\n\nCurrent score: Blue = 0.0, Red = 0.0\n\nI have three options: Ask, Tell, or Pass.\n\nBut **I am no longer in the room**. I left. So I cannot see anything that happens now.\n\nHowever, **C is still in the room** (as far as I know \u2014 no one else left or entered after me, based on the scenario description).\n\nSo C **was in the room the whole time**, and **saw everything that happened**, including after I left.\n\nTherefore, **C knows the current state of the room**, including what\u2019s in the box.\n\nSo when the moderator asks C \u201cWhat is in the box?\u201d, **C can answer correctly** \u2014 unless C chooses to lie, but **players can lie in Tell/Ask, but in the answer phase, they are asked by the moderator and get a point for answering correctly**.\n\nSo **C has an incentive to answer correctly** \u2014 because if C answers correctly, **Red gets 1 point**.\n\nSo **C will likely answer correctly**, unless C is confused \u2014 but C was present for all actions, so **C knows**.\n\nTherefore, **Red is very likely to get 1 point** in the answer phase.\n\nSo **this answer phase will probably result in Red +1**, making score Blue=0.0, Red=1.0.\n\nI cannot stop that \u2014 I can\u2019t affect C\u2019s knowledge or incentive.\n\nSo my action now **cannot prevent Red from getting this point**, because C knows the answer.\n\nSo **any action I take now won\u2019t change the outcome of this answer phase**.\n\nBut I can **prepare for future turns**.\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nI know **what was in the box when I left: the ball**.\n\nBut **after I left**, **anything could have happened** \u2014 D or C could have moved the ball, or swapped things, etc.\n\nBut **I don\u2019t know** what happened after I left.\n\nSimilarly, **B is outside** (left earlier), and **I am now outside**, so **only C and D are in the room** (assuming no one else entered \u2014 the scenario doesn\u2019t say anyone entered, so likely only C and D are inside).\n\nSo **C and D know the current state**; **B and I do not**.\n\nNow, **the question is about the box**, and **C will be asked**.\n\nSo **C will answer correctly** \u2192 **Red gets 1 point**.\n\nSo **this is going to happen**.\n\nSo **my action should be aimed at future advantage**, not trying to block this point (which I can\u2019t).\n\nSo what can I do?\n\nOption 1: **Pass** \u2192 0 cost, nothing happens. Safe.\n\nOption 2: **Ask someone** \u2192 I can ask B, C, or D about a container.\n\nBut **I can only ask about a container**, and **they can lie**.\n\nBut **I don\u2019t need to know now** \u2014 because **the answer phase is about to reveal the truth** (via C\u2019s answer), and **I will hear C\u2019s answer**, because **the answer phase is public** \u2014 the moderator asks C, and C answers, and **all players hear the answer** (implicitly \u2014 otherwise we wouldn\u2019t know scoring).\n\nSo **after C answers**, **I will know what\u2019s in the box** \u2014 **for free**.\n\nSo **I don\u2019t need to spend 0.5 points to Ask anyone** about the box \u2014 **I\u2019ll learn it in a moment**.\n\nSimilarly, **I shouldn\u2019t Tell anyone anything** \u2014 because **I don\u2019t know the current state** (things may have changed after I left), so **anything I tell could be wrong**, and **I\u2019d spend 0.5 points** to possibly misinform my teammate \u2014 **bad idea**.\n\nAlso, **",

      "action": "I need to decide what to do on my turn. The key is to help my team (Blue) score points while preventing the Red team from scoring.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the scenario:\n\n- **Initial state**: All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room. Containers: bag, box, basket \u2014 all empty.\n- **D puts an apple in the bag** \u2192 Now: bag = apple, box = empty, basket = empty. Everyone sees this.\n- **B leaves the room** \u2192 B is now outside. B won\u2019t see anything that happens inside from now on.\n- **D moves the apple from the bag to the box** \u2192 Now: bag = empty, box = apple, basket = empty. A, C, D see this. B does not.\n- **D puts a ball in the bag** \u2192 Now: bag = ball, box = apple, basket = empty. A, C, D see this. B does not.\n- **C leaves the room** \u2192 Now only A and D are in the room. C and B are outside.\n- **You (A) move the apple from the box to the basket** \u2192 Now: bag = ball, box = empty, basket = apple. A and D see this.\n- **D moves the apple from the basket to the box** \u2192 Now: bag = ball, box = apple, basket = empty. A and D see this.\n- **You (A) move the apple from the box to the basket** \u2192 Final state: bag = ball, box = empty, basket = apple. A and D see this.\n\nSo, **final container contents**:\n- **Bag**: ball\n- **Box**: empty\n- **Basket**: apple\n\nNow, the question is: **I am going to ask B what is in the bag.**\n\nB has been **outside the room** since before D put the ball in the bag, and before the apple was moved out of the bag. So B **only saw**:\n- D put an apple in the bag.\n- Then B left.\n- B **does not know** that the apple was moved out, or that a ball was put in.\n\nSo from B\u2019s perspective:\n- The last thing B saw was: **apple in the bag**.\n- B has **no idea** that the apple was moved to the box, then to the basket, or that a ball was added.\n\nSo if asked **\"What is in the bag?\"**, B will likely say **\"apple\"**, because that\u2019s what B last saw \u2014 and B has no information to the contrary.\n\nBut **the correct answer is \"ball\"**.\n\nSo **B is going to answer incorrectly**, unless we intervene.\n\nBut **we (Blue team)** want **B to answer correctly**, because if B answers correctly, **Blue team gets 1 point**.\n\nIf B answers incorrectly, **no one gets a point** (or possibly Red could capitalize later, but only correct answers score).\n\nSo **our goal**: **Help B answer correctly** \u2014 i.e., **tell B the truth about the bag**, so B can update their knowledge and answer \"ball\" when asked.\n\nBut **I can\u2019t control what B says** \u2014 but I **can** give B information **before** the question is asked.\n\nAnd **I am player A**, and it\u2019s **my action phase** \u2014 **before** the answer phase.\n\nSo I can **Tell(B, bag, ball)** \u2014 inform B that the bag contains a ball.\n\nThis costs **0.5 points**, but if B then answers correctly, we get **1 point** \u2014 net **+0.5** for Blue.\n\nIf I do nothing, B will probably say \"apple\" \u2192 wrong \u2192 **0 points** for us.\n\nSo **telling B the truth is worth it**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **could I lie?**  \nI **could** tell B something false \u2014 but that would **hurt our own team**, because B would then give a wrong answer \u2192 no point \u2192 we lose 0.5 for nothing. **Stupid.**\n\nSo **best action**: **Tell B the truth** about the bag.\n\nFormat: **Tell(B, bag, ball)**\n\nThis is **private** \u2014 only B hears it. D and C won\u2019t know.\n\nThen, when B is asked, **B now knows** the bag has a ball \u2192 can answer correctly \u2192 **Blue gets 1 point** \u2192 score becomes **Blue: 1.0 - 0.5 = 0.5**, but wait \u2014 **points are awarded in answer phase**, and **action costs are deducted immediately**.\n\nSo:\n- Action cost: **-0.5** \u2192 Blue = -0.5\n- Then, if B answers correctly: **+1** \u2192 Blue = **+0.5**\n\nStill **net positive**.\n\nIf I **Pass**, Blue stays at 0, and B likely answers wrong \u2192 **no gain**.\n\nSo **Tell(B, bag, ball)** is **optimal**.\n\n**Action:**\n\n**Tell(B, bag, ball)**",

      "action": "I need to figure out what is currently in the basket so that I can help my team score points in the answer phase. The question will be asked to C, and it\u2019s about the basket. Since C left the room before D moved the stapler from the bag to the basket, C does not know about that final move. So C\u2019s knowledge is outdated.\n\nLet me trace the sequence:\n\n- D puts ball in basket \u2192 all see it.\n- B leaves \u2192 now B is out.\n- D moves ball from basket to bag \u2192 A, C, D see this.\n- D puts stapler in basket \u2192 A, C, D see this.\n- C leaves \u2192 now C is out.\n- D moves ball from bag to box \u2192 A, D see this; C does not.\n- D moves stapler from basket to bag \u2192 A, D see this; C does not.\n- D moves stapler from bag to basket \u2192 A, D see this; C does not.\n\nSo at the end:\n- Ball is in the box.\n- Stapler is in the basket.\n\nBut C last saw:\n- Ball moved to bag (not box yet).\n- Stapler put in basket.\nThen C left.\n\nSo C thinks:\n- Ball is in bag.\n- Stapler is in basket.\n\nBut after C left, D moved:\n- Ball from bag to box.\n- Stapler from basket to bag, then back to basket.\n\nSo final state:\n- Box: ball\n- Basket: stapler\n- Bag: empty\n\nC missed the last three moves. So C still thinks:\n- Ball is in bag (but it\u2019s now in box)\n- Stapler is in basket (and it still is, after a round trip)\n\nSo C will say \u201cstapler\u201d if asked about the basket \u2014 and that would be **correct**, even though C\u2019s reasoning is based on outdated info.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **I want my team to score**, and the answer phase will ask C: \u201cWhat is in the basket?\u201d\n\nIf C answers \u201cstapler\u201d, and that\u2019s correct, **Red team (C and D) gets 1 point**.\n\nI **do not** want Red to get that point.\n\nBut I **cannot** stop C from answering \u2014 the question will be asked regardless.\n\nHowever, **I can try to influence C\u2019s answer** \u2014 but I can\u2019t communicate with C directly in a way that changes their belief, because **Tell** only lets me **tell** them something \u2014 I can lie \u2014 but **C is not in the room**, and **Tell is a private action** \u2014 I can tell C something, but **C is outside the room**, and **I can choose to tell C something false**.\n\nBut wait: **C is outside the room**, but **I can still Tell or Ask C** \u2014 the rules don\u2019t say I can only interact with players in the room. It just says the action is private.\n\nSo I **can** Tell(C, basket, ball) \u2014 lie and say the basket has a ball \u2014 to try to make C answer incorrectly.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: **C already saw** the stapler put in the basket **before leaving**. So C **knows** the stapler was in the basket when they left.\n\nThen, **after C left**, D moved the stapler out and back in \u2014 but **C doesn\u2019t know that**.\n\nBut **C\u2019s last belief** is: **stapler is in basket**.\n\nSo if I **tell C \u201cthe basket has a ball\u201d**, C **might not believe me** \u2014 because **players can lie**, and **C knows that**.\n\nBut **C has no way to verify** \u2014 and **the rules say players do not have to tell the truth**.\n\nSo **C can choose to believe or disbelieve** \u2014 but **in the answer phase, C will give **their own answer** \u2014 based on **their own knowledge**, possibly updated by **private communication**.\n\nBut **crucially**: **C does not know I am lying** \u2014 but **C also has **no reason** to trust me** \u2014 I\u2019m on the **opposing team**.\n\nSo **telling C a lie** is **unlikely to change their answer** \u2014 they\u2019ll **ignore it**, or **disbelieve it**, because **I\u2019m the enemy**.\n\nWorse: **if I Tell(C, basket, ball)**, I **spend 0.5 points**, and **C will probably still say \u201cstapler\u201d**, because **that\u2019s what they last saw**, and **they have no reason to trust me**.\n\nSo **I gain nothing**, and **lose 0.5 points**.\n\nAlternatively, I could **Ask** someone \u2014 but **who**?\n\nI **already know** what\u2019s in the basket \u2014 **I saw everything** \u2014 **stapler is in basket**.\n\nSo **I don\u2019t need to ask**.\n\nBut **I can\u2019t stop C from being asked** \u2014 and **C will likely say \u201cstapler\u201d**, which is **correct**, so **Red gets 1 point**.\n\nSo **this answer phase is **likely to give Red a point** \u2014 **I can\u2019t prevent it**.\n\nBut **maybe I can **trick C into answering wrong**?\n\nC\u2019s **last belief**: stapler in basket.\n\n**Current truth**: stapler **is** in basket \u2014 so **even with outdated info**, **C\u2019s belief is **accidentally correct**.\n\nSo **no matter what**, **C will say \u201cstapler\u201d**, and **be right** \u2014 **Red scores**.\n\nSo **I cannot prevent Red from scoring 1 point here**.\n\n**Any action I take that costs points** makes **our score worse**, **with no benefit**.\n\nSo **best action is**: **Pass** \u2014 **don\u2019t spend points**,",

D moves the banana from the basket to the box. ... You move the banana from the box to the basket. ...",
      "question": "I am going to ask C what is in the bag.",
      "action": "I need to decide what to do on my turn. Let me first reconstruct the current state of the room from the scenario.\n\nInitial state:\n- Players: A (me), B, C, D all in the room\n- Containers: bag (empty), box (empty), basket (empty)\n\nSequence of events:\n1. C puts a banana in the bag.\n   \u2192 bag: banana, box: empty, basket: empty\n2. B leaves the room.\n   \u2192 B is now outside, unaware of future events\n3. C leaves the room.\n   \u2192 C is now outside, unaware of future events\n4. D moves the banana from the bag to the box.\n   \u2192 bag: empty, box: banana, basket: empty\n5. D puts a ball in the bag.\n   \u2192 bag: ball, box: banana, basket: empty\n6. I move the banana from the box to the basket.\n   \u2192 bag: ball, box: empty, basket: banana\n7. D moves the banana from the basket to the box.\n   \u2192 bag: ball, box: banana, basket: empty\n8. I move the banana from the box to the basket.\n   \u2192 Final state: bag: ball, box: empty, basket: banana\n\nNow, the question will be asked to C: \u201cWhat is in the bag?\u201d\n\nC left the room after step 3, so C never saw:\n- D put the ball in the bag (step 5)\n- Any of the banana moves after step 3\n\nFrom C\u2019s perspective:\n- After step 1: banana in bag\n- After step 3: C leaves, so last known state is banana in bag\n- C does NOT know the banana was moved out, nor that a ball was added\n\nTherefore, C currently believes the bag still contains the banana.\n\nIf C is asked \u201cWhat is in the bag?\u201d and answers truthfully based on his knowledge, he will say \u201cbanana\u201d \u2014 which is wrong. The correct answer is \u201cball\u201d.\n\nBut C might lie. However, if C lies and says \u201cball\u201d, he would be accidentally correct. But he has no incentive to lie unless he suspects something \u2014 but he has no new info.\n\nSo C will likely say \u201cbanana\u201d, which is incorrect \u2192 Red team gets 0 points from this answer.\n\nBut wait: the rule is: \u201cWhen a player answers my question correctly, their team gets 1 point.\u201d\n\nSo if C answers incorrectly, Red gets 0. If correct, Red gets 1.\n\nCurrently, Red is at 0, Blue at 0.\n\nIf C answers incorrectly, score remains 0\u20130. If correctly, Red goes to 1.\n\nBut C is wrong \u2014 so unless he guesses right by lying, Red gets 0.\n\nBut I want Blue to win. I want to maximize Blue\u2019s chance to score and minimize Red\u2019s.\n\nBut I can\u2019t affect what C says directly \u2014 the question is coming from the system, not me.\n\nBut I can take an action: Ask, Tell, or Pass.\n\nMy action is private \u2014 only the targeted player hears it.\n\nI could try to influence future turns, but this question is about to be asked to C \u2014 and I can\u2019t stop it.\n\nBut wait: the action phase is **before** the answer phase \u2014 and it\u2019s **my turn**. But the question is going to be asked to C **regardless** of my action. My action doesn\u2019t prevent the question.\n\nBut my action **can** be used to gather or share information \u2014 but it costs 0.5 points.\n\nRight now, both teams are at 0.0.\n\nIf I do **Ask** or **Tell**, I lose 0.5 points \u2014 Blue goes to -0.5 \u2014 that\u2019s bad, unless it helps us gain more later.\n\nBut the question is about to be asked to C \u2014 and I **know** C will get it wrong **unless** he somehow knows the truth.\n\nBut C has been outside since step 3 \u2014 he has no idea what happened after.\n\nSo C will say \u201cbanana\u201d \u2192 wrong \u2192 Red gets 0 \u2192 score stays 0\u20130.\n\nThat\u2019s fine \u2014 I don\u2019t want Red to score.\n\nBut if I do **nothing**, I preserve the chance that C gets it wrong.\n\nBut could I **benefit** from acting?\n\nSuppose I **Tell** C the truth: Tell(C, bag, ball)\n\nThen C **knows** the bag has a ball.\n\nThen, when asked, C might say \u201cball\u201d \u2192 correct \u2192 Red gets 1 point \u2192 Red leads 1\u20130.\n\nThat **helps the enemy** \u2014 bad.\n\nSuppose I **lie** to C: Tell(C, bag, banana) \u2014 but he already thinks that \u2014 so no change \u2014 but I still lose 0.5 points \u2014 and C still gets it wrong \u2014 so Red gets 0, but Blue drops to -0.5 \u2014 worse than before.\n\nSo telling C \u2014 truth or lie \u2014 either helps Red or hurts Blue \u2014 never helps Blue.\n\nWhat if I **Ask** C something?\n\nSay: Ask(C, bag)\n\nC will answer \u2014 but C only knows \u201cbanana\u201d \u2014 so he\u2019ll say \u201cbanana\u201d, whether truthfully or lying \u2014 but I already know the truth: it\u2019s **ball**.\n\nSo I learn nothing useful \u2014 and I pay 0.5 points \u2014 Blue goes to -0.5 \u2014 again, worse.\n\nAlternatively, I could ask about another container \u2014 but I already know everything:\n\n- bag: ball\n- box: empty\n- basket: banana\n\nI saw everything \u2014 I have perfect knowledge.\n\nSo asking anyone anything \u2014 I gain **no new information** \u2014 but pay 0.5.\n\nTelling \u2014 only helps enemy or wastes points.\n\nPass \u2014",

The question will be asked to **B**, and it\u2019s about **what is in the bag**.\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the sequence of events carefully, from the perspective of **who knows what**.\n\n---\n\n### Initial state:\n- All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.\n- Containers: bag, box, basket \u2014 all empty.\n\n### Events:\n1. **D puts a banana in the bag.**  \n   \u2192 All players see this.  \n   \u2192 Now: bag = banana, box = empty, basket = empty.\n\n2. **D leaves the room.**  \n   \u2192 All players see D leave.  \n   \u2192 D is now outside, unaware of future events.\n\n3. **B moves the banana from the bag to the box.**  \n   \u2192 A, B, C are in the room \u2192 they all see this.  \n   \u2192 Now: bag = empty, box = banana, basket = empty.\n\n4. **B puts a brick in the bag.**  \n   \u2192 A, B, C see this.  \n   \u2192 Now: bag = brick, box = banana, basket = empty.\n\n5. **B leaves the room.**  \n   \u2192 A and C see B leave.  \n   \u2192 B is now outside, unaware of future events.\n\n6. **C moves the banana from the box to the basket.**  \n   \u2192 A and C are in the room \u2192 they see this.  \n   \u2192 Now: bag = brick, box = empty, basket = banana.\n\n7. **C moves the brick from the bag to the box.**  \n   \u2192 A and C see this.  \n   \u2192 Now: bag = empty, box = brick, basket = banana.\n\n8. **C moves the brick from the box to the bag.**  \n   \u2192 A and C see this.  \n   \u2192 Final state: bag = brick, box = empty, basket = banana.\n\n---\n\n### Final container states:\n- **Bag**: brick  \n- **Box**: empty  \n- **Basket**: banana\n\n---\n\n### Who knows what?\n\nLet\u2019s track **B\u2019s knowledge**.\n\n- B was present for steps 1\u20135.\n- After step 5, B **leaves** the room.\n- So B **did not see** steps 6, 7, or 8.\n\nSo from B\u2019s perspective:\n- After step 5: bag = brick, box = banana, basket = empty.\n- Then B leaves.\n- B **does not know** that C moved the banana to the basket, or that the brick was moved from bag \u2192 box \u2192 bag.\n\nSo **B\u2019s last known state** is:\n- bag = brick\n- box = banana\n- basket = empty\n\nBut **in reality**, after C\u2019s moves:\n- bag = brick\n- box = empty\n- basket = banana\n\nSo **B thinks** the bag has a **brick** \u2014 and **B is correct** about the bag!\n\nEven though B missed the later moves, **the brick ended up back in the bag**, so **B\u2019s belief is accurate**.\n\nSo **B will answer \u201cbrick\u201d** if asked what is in the bag \u2014 and **that is correct**.\n\nTherefore, **if B is asked what is in the bag, B will likely say \u201cbrick\u201d**, and **that will earn the Blue team 1 point**.\n\nBut **I am A**, and **I know the truth**. I also know that **B\u2019s belief is correct**, even if B\u2019s reasoning is incomplete.\n\nSo **B is going to get the question right**, **unless** someone misleads B **before** the answer phase.\n\nBut the **answer phase is coming next**, and **I am in the action phase** \u2014 **my turn** \u2014 **right before** the answer phase.\n\nThe question is: **\u201cI am going to ask B what is in the bag.\u201d**\n\nSo **after my action**, the answer phase begins, and **B will be asked**.\n\nMy goal: **maximize Blue team\u2019s chance to get this point**.\n\nSince **B already believes the bag contains a brick**, and **that is correct**, **B will answer correctly** \u2014 **unless** B has been misled **since** leaving the room.\n\nBut **no one has told B anything** \u2014 because **Tell and Ask actions are private**, and **no actions have occurred yet**.\n\nSo **B\u2019s knowledge is unchanged** \u2014 and **correct**.\n\nTherefore, **if nothing happens**, **B will answer \u201cbrick\u201d**, and **Blue gets 1 point**.\n\nSo **my best move is to do nothing** \u2014 **Pass** \u2014 **because any Ask or Tell costs 0.5 points**, and **B already knows the correct answer**.\n\nEven if I **Tell B** the bag has a brick, it costs 0.5 points \u2014 **and B already knows it** \u2014 so **no benefit**.\n\nIf I **Ask** someone, it costs 0.5 \u2014 **and I already know** the bag has a brick \u2014 **so no benefit**.\n\n**Pass** is free \u2014 and **preserves the correct answer**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **could B be uncertain**? No \u2014 B **saw** the brick being put in the bag, and **never saw it removed** \u2014 because **B left before C moved it**.\n\nBut **C moved the brick out and back in** \u2014 **but B didn\u2019t see that**.\n\nSo **B thinks** the brick is **still** in the bag \u2014 and **by coincidence**, **it is**.\n\nSo **B\u2019s answer will be correct** \u2014 **even though B\u2019s justification is incomplete**.\n\nTherefore, **B will score the point** \u2014 **unless** I **mess it up** by **telling B something wrong** \u2014 but that would be stupid.\n\nOr **if I tell B the wrong",

I (A) put an orange in the basket.\n   - Everyone in the room sees this.\n\n2. B leaves the room.\n   - B is now outside and unaware of anything that happens inside.\n\n3. C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.\n   - A, C, D see this. B does not.\n\n4. B enters the room.\n   - B re-enters and now sees future events, but missed the move in step 3.\n\n5. D moves the orange from the bag to the basket.\n   - A, B, C, D all see this (everyone is now in the room).\n\n6. D leaves the room.\n   - D is now outside.\n\n7. C leaves the room.\n   - C is now outside.\n\n8. B moves the orange from the basket to the box.\n   - A and B see this (C and D are outside and do not see it).\n\n9. I (A) put a ball in the basket.\n   - A and B see this (C and D are outside and do not see it).\n\nCurrent state (who is in the room):\n- A (me) and B are in the room.\n- C and D are outside.\n\nCurrent container contents:\n- bag: empty (orange was moved out in step 5, nothing put back)\n- box: orange (B moved it there in step 8)\n- basket: ball (I put it there in step 9)\n\nNow, the question phase will ask B: \u201cWhat is in the basket?\u201d\n\nB\u2019s knowledge:\n- B saw me put the orange in the basket (step 1).\n- B did not see C move it to the bag (step 3) \u2014 B was outside.\n- B re-entered and then saw D move the orange back to the basket (step 5).\n- B then moved the orange from the basket to the box (step 8).\n- B saw me put a ball in the basket (step 9).\n\nSo B knows:\n- The orange is now in the box.\n- The basket now contains a ball.\n\nTherefore, when asked \u201cWhat is in the basket?\u201d, B will correctly say \u201ca ball\u201d, and Blue team will earn 1 point.\n\nI want to help my team (Blue) score. Since B already knows the correct answer, there is no need for me to intervene. Any Ask or Tell would cost 0.5 points and could only risk misleading or confusing B, or waste points. Passing costs 0 and changes nothing.\n\nBest action: Pass.\n\nAction: Pass",

So B does not know that the ball was moved out of the box or that an apple was put in. B only knows that D put a ball in the box, and then B left. So B likely still thinks the box has the ball.\n\nBut the question is: I am going to ask B what is in the box.\n\nSo in the answer phase, B will be asked, and if B answers correctly (apple), Blue team gets 1 point. But B currently believes the box has the ball \u2014 so B will likely answer \"ball\", which is wrong.\n\nI need to inform B of the correct contents before the answer phase.\n\nBest action: Tell B what is actually in the box.\n\nAction: Tell(B, box, apple)\n\nThis costs 0.5 points, but if B then answers \"apple\" correctly, we gain 1 point \u2014 net +0.5 for Blue.\n\nAlternatively, I could Ask someone, but I already know the box has the apple \u2014 I saw the whole sequence. No need to Ask.\n\nSo I should Tell B the truth.\n\nAction: Tell(B, box, apple)",

      "action": "I need to decide what to do in this action phase. The key is to maximize the chance that **C answers the question about the basket correctly**, since the question will be asked to **C**, and if C answers correctly, **Red team (C and D)** gets 1 point. My team (Blue: A and B) wants to prevent that \u2014 we want C to answer **incorrectly**, so Red doesn\u2019t score.\n\nBut I can\u2019t directly control what C says. However, I can try to **influence C\u2019s belief** about what\u2019s in the basket, or **gather information** to help my team later.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the scenario step by step:\n\n---\n\n**Initial state:**\n- All players (A, B, C, D) in room.\n- Containers: bag, box, basket \u2014 all empty.\n- B puts **stapler** in **basket**.\n\nSo now:\n- basket: stapler\n- bag: empty\n- box: empty\n\n**C leaves the room.**\n- C is now **outside**, unaware of anything that happens inside.\n\n**D leaves the room.**\n- D is also outside. Now only A and B are in the room.\n\n**You (A) move the stapler from basket to bag.**\n- Now: bag has stapler, basket is empty.\n\n**You put a banana in the basket.**\n- Now: basket has banana, bag has stapler, box empty.\n\n**B moves the stapler from bag to box.**\n- Now: box has stapler, bag empty, basket has banana.\n\n**You move the stapler from box to bag.**\n- Now: bag has stapler, box empty, basket has banana.\n\n**B moves the stapler from bag to box.**\n- Final state:\n  - box: stapler\n  - bag: empty\n  - basket: banana\n\n---\n\nNow, **C is outside the room** during **all** of these later events (after C left). So C **does not know**:\n- That the stapler was moved from basket \u2192 bag \u2192 box \u2192 bag \u2192 box\n- That a banana was put in the basket\n- That the basket is no longer empty\n\nIn fact, **C last saw**:\n- The stapler in the basket\n- Then C left\n- Then D left\n- Then a bunch of stuff happened \u2014 but C saw none of it\n\nSo **C\u2019s current belief** is likely: **basket has stapler**, because that\u2019s the last thing C saw.\n\nBut **in reality**, the basket has a **banana**.\n\nSo when I am asked: *\u201cI am going to ask C what is in the basket.\u201d*\n\nIf C answers **\u201cstapler\u201d**, that\u2019s **wrong** \u2192 Red team **does not** get a point \u2192 good for Blue.\n\nIf C answers **\u201cbanana\u201d**, that\u2019s **correct** \u2192 Red team **gets 1 point** \u2192 bad for Blue.\n\nSo **I want C to answer incorrectly** \u2014 i.e., say \u201cstapler\u201d \u2014 so that C is wrong.\n\nBut C might **not** say \u201cstapler\u201d \u2014 C might **guess**, or **be told**, or **ask someone**, or **be told by someone else**.\n\nBut right now, **it\u2019s my turn** in the **action phase**, and I can:\n- Ask someone (e.g., Ask B what\u2019s in the basket) \u2014 costs 0.5\n- Tell someone something (e.g., Tell C that the basket has a stapler) \u2014 costs 0.5\n- Pass \u2014 costs 0\n\nBut **C is outside the room**, and **I cannot communicate with C directly** unless I use **Tell(Player, Container, Contents)** \u2014 but **Tell** is **private**, and **can be a lie**.\n\nSo I **can** Tell(C, basket, stapler) \u2014 even though it\u2019s **false** \u2014 to **reinforce C\u2019s false belief**.\n\nBut **would that help?**\n\nYes \u2014 **if C believes** the basket has the stapler, then when asked, C will say \u201cstapler\u201d, which is **wrong**, so **Red gets 0 points** \u2014 **good for Blue**.\n\nBut **C might not trust me** \u2014 but the rules don\u2019t say anything about trust. **C will hear whatever I tell**, and **can choose to believe it or not** \u2014 but **I don\u2019t know** what C will do.\n\nBut **my goal** is to **maximize the chance** that C answers **incorrectly**.\n\nSo **if I tell C that the basket has the stapler**, I am **reinforcing** C\u2019s **existing false belief** \u2014 which makes it **more likely** that C will **answer \u201cstapler\u201d** \u2014 which is **wrong** \u2014 so **Red gets 0** \u2014 **good**.\n\nAlternatively, I could **do nothing** \u2014 but that **doesn\u2019t help** \u2014 C might still guess \u201cstapler\u201d, but **I can increase the chance** by **lying to C**.\n\nBut **it costs 0.5 points** to Tell.\n\nIs it worth 0.5 points to **increase the chance** that **Red gets 0 instead of 1**?\n\nYes \u2014 because **if C answers correctly**, Red gets **+1** \u2014 a **1-point swing** in their favor.\n\nIf I **spend 0.5** to **prevent** that, I **save 1 point** \u2014 so **net benefit** of **0.5** \u2014 **worth it**.\n\nAlternatively, I could **Ask B** what\u2019s in the basket \u2014 but **I already know** \u2014 it\u2019s **banana**.

      "action": "I need to figure out what is currently in the bag, because the question will be asking me that.\n\nLet me reconstruct the sequence step-by-step, tracking only the bag (since the question is about the bag):\n\n- Start: bag empty  \n- C leaves (irrelevant to bag)  \n- I put a brick in the bag \u2192 bag: brick  \n- C enters (irrelevant)  \n- I leave  \n- I enter  \n- C moves the orange from the bag to the basket \u2192 this implies the bag must have contained an orange at that moment. But I had put a brick in earlier. Contradiction?  \n\nWait: the narrative says \u201cC moves the orange from the bag to the basket.\u201d That can only happen if the orange was already in the bag. But I never put an orange in; I put a brick in. And no one else has been described as putting anything in before this point. The only object mentioned as being placed is my brick.\n\nTherefore, the only way an orange could be in the bag is if someone secretly placed it while I was outside. But the rules say: if an object is put into a container while a player is outside the room, that player is *not* told. However, any player who is inside at the time *is* aware.\n\nLet\u2019s list every event with who is present:\n\n1. All inside. Bag empty.  \n2. C leaves \u2192 now A,B,D inside.  \n3. I (A) put brick in bag \u2192 bag: brick. (B and D witness)  \n4. C enters \u2192 all inside.  \n5. I leave \u2192 B,C,D inside.  \n6. I enter \u2192 all inside.  \n7. C moves orange from bag to basket \u2192 this implies at this moment the bag contains an orange. But I left the brick in there. So either the brick was removed earlier, or the orange was added while I was out.\n\nBut no one is described as removing the brick. And no one is described as adding an orange. The only way the orange could appear is if someone (B, C, or D) put it in while I was outside (step 5: I leave \u2192 I enter). During that interval, B,C,D were inside. One of them could have:\n\n- removed the brick (not mentioned)  \n- put in an orange (not mentioned)\n\nBut the rules say: \u201cwhen a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room.\u201d So if B, C, or D had removed the brick or added an orange, *they* would know, but *I* (having been outside) would *not* be told. The scenario description only tells me what I would perceive. Since I was outside during that interval, I am *not* told about any silent actions (put/remove) that occurred then.\n\nTherefore, the narrative I receive skips any put/remove actions that happened while I was out. That means:\n\n- After I put the brick in (step 3), the bag has brick.  \n- While I\u2019m out (step 5\u21926), someone could have:  \n  \u2013 taken the brick out (silent to me)  \n  \u2013 put an orange in (silent to me)  \n\nThen at step 7, C (who is inside) moves \u201cthe orange\u201d from bag to basket. That action is described to me because I am now inside. So at that moment, the bag *does* contain an orange \u2014 the brick is gone.\n\nSimilarly, immediately after, D moves \u201cthe orange\u201d from basket back to bag \u2014 so bag again has orange.\n\nThen later: B leaves and enters, I leave, D leaves \u2014 no further moves involving bag are mentioned.\n\nSo final state: bag contains orange.\n\nBut I never saw the orange being placed or the brick being removed \u2014 those happened while I was outside. Yet the narrative *does* tell me about C\u2019s and D\u2019s moves *after* I return, because those happen while I\u2019m inside.\n\nThus, despite not having seen the orange\u2019s arrival, I *do* know that:\n\n- At the time C moved it, the orange was in the bag.  \n- Then D put it back into the bag.  \n\nAnd nothing thereafter changes the bag. So the bag now holds an orange.\n\nI do *not* need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell \u2014 I can deduce it.\n\nTherefore, I will simply Pass, saving the point.\n\nAction: Pass",

Let me first reconstruct the final state of the containers from the scenario, because the question will be asked to D about the box.\n\nStep-by-step:\n\n1. Start: bag, box, basket all empty.  \n2. B puts orange in box \u2192 box: orange, bag & basket empty.  \n3. D leaves (now D is outside, so D misses everything that happens next).  \n4. C moves orange from box to bag \u2192 bag: orange, box: empty, basket: empty.  \n5. B puts stapler in box \u2192 box: stapler, bag: orange, basket: empty.  \n6. C moves stapler from box to basket \u2192 basket: stapler, box: empty, bag: orange.  \n7. B moves orange from bag to box \u2192 box: orange, bag: empty, basket: stapler.  \n8. B leaves.\n\nFinal state when the question is asked:\n- box: orange  \n- bag: empty  \n- basket: stapler  \n\nD is outside and has been since step 3, so D has no knowledge of any of the moves after that. D last knew:\n- box: orange (after step 2)  \n- then D left, and never saw the later moves.\n\nTherefore, if D is honest, D would say \u201corange\u201d (correct). But players may lie. However, the scoring rule is: if the target player (D) answers the question correctly, Red team gets 1 point. If D answers incorrectly, no points. So Blue wants D to be wrong; Red wants D to be right.\n\nI am on Blue (A & B). I want Red to miss this question, so I want D to answer incorrectly. I can\u2019t force D to lie, but I can try to mislead D privately.\n\nMy options:\n- Ask: costs 0.5, but I already know the true state, so asking anyone won\u2019t help me.  \n- Tell: I can tell D something false about the box, hoping D believes it and repeats it when asked.  \n- Pass: do nothing, let D rely on outdated info (D thinks box still has orange, which is actually correct!).  \n\nIf I do nothing, D will likely say \u201corange\u201d and be correct \u2192 Red gets 1 point. That\u2019s bad for Blue.\n\nSo I should try to make D answer wrong. I can tell D a lie: say the box contains something else, so when D is asked, D might repeat my lie.\n\nBest lie: tell D the box contains the stapler (the other object). Then D might say \u201cstapler\u201d \u2192 wrong \u2192 Red gets 0, Blue avoids losing ground.\n\nCost: 0.5 points, but prevents Red from gaining 1, so net +0.5 swing.\n\nAction: Tell(D, box, stapler)\n\nAction: Tell(D, box, stapler)",

Apple put in bag.\n2. Later, D moves apple from box to bag.\n\nBut B **did not see** C move the apple from bag to box while B was outside.\n\nTherefore, B\u2019s belief:\n- B thinks the apple went: bag \u2192 (invisible move) \u2192 still in bag? No \u2014 B **saw** D move it from box to bag. So B knows it was in the box before D moved it.\n\nBut how did it get into the box? B didn\u2019t see that. So B knows:\n- Apple was in bag (saw it placed)\n- Then B left.\n- Then B saw D move apple **from box to bag** \u2014 so B infers it must have been moved to the box at some point, but doesn\u2019t know when.\n\nSo B **does** know the apple is now in the bag \u2014 because B saw D put it there.\n\nTherefore, **B already knows the bag contains the apple**.\n\nSo if I do nothing, B will likely answer correctly \u2014 Blue gets +1.\n\nBut if I Ask or Tell, it costs 0.5 points \u2014 and we don\u2019t need to do anything to win this round \u2014 we just need B to answer correctly.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the question is: **I am going to ask B what is in the bag.**\n\nSo B will answer based on B\u2019s knowledge.\n\nB **does** know the apple is in the bag (because B saw D move it there). So B will answer \"apple\" \u2014 **if B remembers**.\n\nBut B **does** remember \u2014 B saw D move it from box to bag.

From B\u2019s perspective, since B was outside during the move, B **does not know** the stapler was moved.\n   - So when B re-enters, B **still thinks** the stapler is in the basket (because that\u2019s where it was when B left).\n\n5. **D moves the stapler from the box to the basket.**\n   - Now: Basket has stapler, Box is empty\n   - B is in the room \u2192 B **sees** this move.\n\n6. **C leaves the room.**\n   - C exits. B sees this.\n\n7. **D leaves the room.**\n   - D exits. B sees this.\n\n8. **B moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.**\n   - Now: Bag has stapler, Basket is empty\n   - B does this \u2192 B **knows** the stapler is now in the bag.\n\n9. **B puts a ball in the basket.**\n   - Now: Basket has ball, Bag has stapler, Box is empty\n   - B does this \u2192 B **knows** the basket now contains a ball.\n\n---\n\n### **Final state (as known to you, A):**\n- **Bag**: stapler\n- **Box**: empty\n- **Basket**: ball\n\n---\n\n### **What does B know?**\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct B\u2019s knowledge:\n\n- B was in the room at the start \u2192 saw you put stapler in basket \u2192 thinks: basket = stapler\n- B leaves \u2192 misses C moving stapler to box\n- B re-enters \u2192 still thinks stapler is in basket (because that\u2019s where it was when B left, and B didn\u2019t see the move)\n- Then B **sees** D move stapler from box to basket \u2192 but B **thought** it was already in the basket!  \n  \u2192 This is confusing. But B **sees** D move it **from box to basket**, so now B knows:\n  - It was in the box (so C must have moved it while B was out)\n  - Now it\u2019s back in the basket\n- Then B **personally moves** the stapler from basket to bag \u2192 so B **knows** stapler is now in bag\n- Then B puts a **ball** in the basket \u2192 so B **knows** basket now has a ball\n\nSo **B knows exactly**:\n- Bag: stapler\n- Basket: ball\n- Box: empty\n\nTherefore, **B knows the basket contains a ball**.\n\n---\n\n### **The Question:**\n> I am going to ask B what is in the basket.\n\nSince B **knows** the basket has a **ball**, B will **answer correctly** \u2192 **Blue team gets 1 point**.\n\nSo **if nothing changes**, **we (Blue) will score 1 point** from this answer.\n\nOur current score: Blue = 0.0, Red = 0.0  \nAfter correct answer: Blue = 1.0\n\n---\n\n### **Should I take an action?**\n\nMy options:\n- **Ask(Player, Container)** \u2192 costs 0.5, learn info\n- **Tell(Player, Container, Contents)** \u2192 costs 0.5, give info\n- **Pass** \u2192 costs 0, do nothing\n\nBut **I already know the truth**. And **B already knows the truth** about the basket.\n\nSo **telling B** the contents of the basket is **useless** \u2014 B already knows it\u2019s a ball.\n\n**Asking** someone about the basket? I already know it\u2019s a ball. And B is about to be asked \u2014 I don\u2019t need to ask anyone.\n\nBut here\u2019s a **key point**: **I can lie in a Tell action**, and **other players can lie when asked**.\n\nHowever, **I cannot affect what B will say** \u2014 the question is coming from the game host, not me. B will answer based on B\u2019s knowledge.\n\nBut **could I influence B\u2019s answer** by **telling B something false**?\n\nWait \u2014 **Tell actions are private**, and **I can lie**.\n\nSo I could **tell B** something wrong about the basket \u2014 but **B already knows** it has a ball, because **B just put the ball there**.\n\nSo if I say: **Tell(B, basket, stapler)** \u2014 B will know I\u2019m lying, because B **just put the ball in the basket**.\n\nThat might **confuse B**, but **B has no reason to believe me** over their own memory.\n\nMoreover, **B is not required to tell the truth to the host** \u2014 but **there\u2019s no incentive to lie to the host**, because **correct answers give points**.\n\nSo **B will answer truthfully** to the host, because **B wants Blue to score**.\n\nTherefore, **B will say \u201cball\u201d**,",

Now B knows: bag has banana, box has ball, basket empty.\n- B leaves the room \u2192 B no longer sees anything that happens after this.\n\nAfter B leaves:\n- I move the ball from the box to the basket \u2192 B does **not** see this.\n- C moves the ball from the basket to the box \u2192 B does **not** see this.\n- I move the ball from the box to the basket \u2192 B does **not** see this.\n\nSo, from B\u2019s current knowledge:\n- Bag: has banana (last thing B saw before leaving)\n- Box: had ball when B left, but B doesn\u2019t know about later moves\n- Basket: was empty when B left\n\nBut the ball has been moved around **after** B left, so B\u2019s knowledge of the box and basket is outdated.\n\nHowever, the question is: **\u201cWhat is in the bag?\u201d**\n\nB **does** know the bag has a banana, because B saw me put it in, and B hasn\u2019t seen it removed (and it hasn\u2019t been removed).\n\nSo B **should** answer \u201cbanana\u201d correctly \u2014 **unless** B has been misled.\n\nBut I cannot control what others say \u2014 and I cannot see inside containers now either. I only know the history.\n\nI **do** know:\n- Banana was put in the bag while B was present.\n- No one has removed the banana since.\n- So the bag **still contains the banana**.\n\nTherefore, B **should** answer correctly \u2014 **unless** B has forgotten or is confused.\n\nBut I cannot communicate with B now in a way that helps **without** costing points.\n\nMy options:\n- Ask someone: costs 0.5, but I don\u2019t need info \u2014 I **know** the bag has banana.\n- Tell B: \u201cTell(B, bag, banana)\u201d \u2014 but B **already believes** that. It might reinforce, but costs 0.5, and B might already know.\n- Pass: costs 0, and B will likely answer correctly.\n\nSince B **saw** the banana go into the bag, and **never saw it leave**, B **knows** the bag has the banana.\n\nSo B will almost certainly answer correctly.\n\nThus, **no action is needed** \u2014 I should **Pass** to avoid losing 0.5 points unnecessarily.\n\n**Action: Pass**",

B saw me put the stapler in the bag initially, but then B moved the stapler to the box while C and D were outside.

I put a stapler in the bag \u2192 Bag: stapler, Box: empty, Basket: empty\n2. D leaves the room\n3. C leaves the room\n4. B moves the stapler from the bag to the box \u2192 Bag: empty, Box: stapler, Basket: empty\n5. I put an orange in the bag \u2192 Bag: orange, Box: stapler, Basket: empty\n6. I move the stapler from the box to the basket \u2192 Bag: orange, Box: empty, Basket: stapler\n7. B moves the stapler from the basket to the box \u2192 Bag: orange, Box: stapler, Basket: empty\n8. I move the stapler from the box to the basket \u2192 Bag: orange, Box: empty, Basket: stapler\n9. B moves the stapler from the basket to the box \u2192 Bag: orange, Box: stapler, Basket: empty\n\nSo, at the end:\n- Bag: orange\n- Box: stapler\n- Basket: empty\n\nThe question will be: \"What is in the bag?\" asked to B.\n\nB was present for all these actions, so B knows the bag currently contains an orange.\n\nIf B answers correctly, Blue team (my team) gets 1 point. If B answers incorrectly, no points.\n\nBut B knows the truth, so B will likely answer correctly \u2014 unless I interfere.\n\nBut I cannot change what B will say \u2014 the question is directed to B, and B will answer based on what B believes.\n\nHowever, I can choose to **Tell** B something false, to try to make B doubt or change their answer \u2014 but that risks B still answering correctly (since B saw everything), and then I just cost us 0.5 points for nothing.\n\nAlternatively, I could **Ask** B what is in the bag \u2014 but that costs 0.5 points, and I already know it's an orange. That would be wasteful.\n\nOr I could **Pass** \u2014 do nothing, cost 0 points, and let B answer correctly, earning us 1 point.\n\nSince B was in the room the whole time and saw every move, B knows the bag has an orange. There's no reason for B to get it wrong. Any attempt to mislead B would likely fail and just cost us points.\n\nBest action: **Pass**, let B answer correctly, gain 1 point for Blue team.\n\n**Pass**",
