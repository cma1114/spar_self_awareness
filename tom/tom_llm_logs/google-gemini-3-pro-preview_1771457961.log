I'm focused on the team's victory condition. Currently, the score is the primary metric, and it is a known state. My immediate concern is defining the path to a win for Blue, including the roles and capabilities of A and B, in the context of the current score state.

**Contemplating Game Dynamics**

I'm currently focused on the core mechanics. It's a strategic deduction game requiring memory and information sharing. My role is Player A, but I need to decide on the teammate's actions and the best way to extract information from them, and how I can help the teammate. I'm focusing on the interplay between memory and sharing.
