Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. There's an empty bag, empty box, and empty basket.
2. D puts a brick in the box. → Box has brick.
3. I (A) leave the room. → I can no longer see what happens inside.
4. **While I'm outside, things may have happened that I didn't see.** Specifically, the next event I see after re-entering is "C moves the brick from the bag to the box." This means that while I was outside, someone must have moved the brick from the box to the bag (since when I left, the brick was in the box, but C later moves it FROM the bag).
5. I enter the room.
6. C moves the brick from the bag to the box. → Box has brick.

So after all events, the brick is in the box.

But wait - I need to consider whether anything else happened while I was outside that I didn't see. The scenario describes what I see, so while I was out, I only know about people entering/leaving. The fact that the brick ended up in the bag (so C could move it from bag to box) means someone moved it while I was out. But could other objects have been placed too?

The key question is: what is currently in the box? From what I observed, C moved the brick from the bag to the box. So the box contains the brick. However, something could have been placed in the box while I was outside (after the brick was moved to the bag), and then C's action of moving the brick to the box would only work if the box was empty at that point (since each container holds at most one object). So the box must have been empty when C put the brick in it.

Therefore, the box contains the brick. I'm confident in this answer.

Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag based on what I observed.

Let me trace through the events I witnessed:

1. I, B, C, and D are in the room (bag, box, basket all empty)
2. B leaves the room
3. D leaves the room
4. C puts an apple in the bag → **bag has apple**
5. B enters the room
6. D enters the room
7. I leave the room → I can no longer see what happens inside
8. I enter the room → I can see again
9. C moves the apple from the bag to the basket → **bag empty, basket has apple**
10. D moves the apple from the basket to the bag → **bag has apple, basket empty**
11. D leaves the room
12. D enters the room
13. I leave the room → I can no longer see what happens

After I left the room the last time, something could have happened. But based on what I last saw, the bag contains the apple. However, since I'm now outside the room, things might have changed after I left.

The question is: do I know for certain what's in the bag right now? After I left, B, C, and D (D re-entered) are in the room and could have moved things. I don't know if anything changed after I left.

But the question will be asked to me, and I last saw the apple in the bag. The risk is that something changed after I left. Let me consider whether to ask someone.

If I ask B (my teammate), it costs 0.5 points. B is in the room and would know the current state. If the answer is correct, I get 1 point, net 0.5. If I pass and answer correctly, I get 1 point net. If I pass and answer wrong, I get 0 points.

The probability that nothing changed seems reasonable - there's no indication of further movement after I left. But opponents C could have moved things to trick me.

I think asking my teammate B is the safe play to ensure I get it right.

Ask(B, bag)
A answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: The stapler was put in the bag by B. Then D moved it to the basket, then C moved it back to the bag. All of this happened while I was in the room. After I left, B also left, but I need to consider whether C or D did anything after I left.

After I left the room, C and D remained inside. I don't know what happened after I left. The stapler was in the bag when I left, but C and D could have moved it.

Since I'm the one being asked, and I'm not certain the stapler is still in the bag (C and D could have moved it after I left), let me consider whether to ask someone.

B also left the room after me, so B doesn't know what happened after I left either. C and D are on the opposing team and could lie.

The cost of asking is 0.5 points, and if C or D lie, I waste 0.5 points. If I just guess "stapler" (the last known contents when I left), there's a reasonable chance it's correct since C and D may or may not have moved it.

However, C and D are opponents - they have no incentive to help me. Asking them would cost 0.5 and they'd likely lie.

The safest play is to Pass and answer "stapler" based on my last observation. The expected value of asking an opponent is likely negative (they'll lie), and B doesn't have more information than I do.

A answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are in the room. Bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. D leaves the room.
3. C puts a brick in the box. (I see this)
4. D enters the room.
5. I leave the room. (From here, I can't see what happens inside)
6. I enter the room. (I can see again)
7. D moves the brick from the box to the basket. (I see this)
8. C moves the brick from the basket to the box. (I see this)
9. I leave the room. (I can't see what happens after this)
10. C leaves the room.

So after step 8, the brick is in the box. Then I leave the room (step 9), and C leaves the room (step 10). 

Between step 9 and step 10, B and C and D are in the room. Could something have happened? The scenario only describes what I can observe. Since I'm outside the room, I wouldn't know if B or D moved anything.

Between step 10 and the end, B and D are in the room. They could have moved things too.

So the last state I know for certain is: brick is in the box (after step 8). But things could have changed after I left.

B was in the room the entire time and saw everything. Let me ask B what's in the box.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through what I know:

1. **Everyone in room**: D puts a banana in the box. (I see this)
2. **I leave the room.** (I can no longer see what happens inside)
3. **I enter the room.** (I can see again)
4. **I'm in the room**: D moves the banana from the box to the basket. (I see this)
5. **I'm in the room**: C moves the banana from the basket to the box. (I see this)
6. **I leave the room.** (I can no longer see what happens)

So at the point I left the room the last time, the banana was in the box. However, things could have happened after I left that I'm unaware of.

Since I left the room at the end, I don't know if anything changed after I left. B might also not know since B's status after step 1 isn't explicitly stated - let me re-read.

Actually, looking at the scenario again: it says "You, B, C, and D are in a room" at the start. Then "You leave the room" - only I leave. Then "You enter the room" - only I enter. Then after the moves, "You leave the room" again.

B was in the room the entire time (no mention of B leaving). C and D were also in the room the entire time. So B knows everything that happened, including anything after I left.

Since something might have happened after I left, I should ask B what's in the box. B was there the whole time and is my teammate, so B has incentive to tell me the truth.

B's knowledge: B was present when the stapler was put in the box. B then left the room. After B left, nothing happened to the box - the stapler is still there.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

The question is: "What is in the box?"

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a stapler in the box.
3. D leaves the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. I put a banana in the bag.
6. C moves the banana from the bag to the basket.
7. I move the banana from the basket to the bag.
8. C moves the banana from the bag to the basket.

So currently:
- Box: stapler (nothing happened to it after B put it there)
- Bag: empty
- Basket: banana

B's perspective: B saw himself put the stapler in the box. Then D left, then B left. After B left, B doesn't know what happened in the room. But nothing happened to the box after B left - the only movements were the banana between bag and basket.

So B should know the stapler is still in the box. B will correctly answer "stapler" and Blue gets 1 point.

Since B already knows the correct answer (the stapler is in the box, and B was present when it was placed there, and nothing changed about the box after B left), there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

So the current state is:
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty
- Basket: stapler

B's perspective: B left after putting the brick in the box. B doesn't know about any of the moves C made. So B thinks the box still contains the brick.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B.

B will likely answer "brick" based on their last knowledge - and that happens to be correct! The brick is indeed back in the box after C moved it around.

So B will answer correctly without any help from me. I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

B will be asked what's in the basket. Let me trace what B saw:

1. B was in the room and put an orange in the basket.
2. D left the room (B was still inside).
3. C moved the orange from the basket to the bag (B was still inside, so B saw this).
4. B put a banana in the basket (B was still inside).
5. B left the room.

So B saw everything that happened while they were in the room. B knows:
- The orange was moved from the basket to the bag by C.
- B then put a banana in the basket.

So B knows the basket contains a banana. B will answer correctly.

Since B already knows the correct answer (banana is in the basket), there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

B will be asked what's in the basket. Let me trace what B saw:

1. B was in the room initially.
2. B put an orange in the basket.
3. D leaves the room (B still inside).
4. C moves the orange from the basket to the bag (B sees this).
5. B puts a banana in the basket (B sees this, obviously).
6. B leaves the room.
7. After B leaves: C moves orange from bag to box, I move orange from box to bag, C moves orange from bag to box.

So from B's perspective, when B left the room:
- Basket: banana
- Bag: orange
- Box: empty

After B left, B doesn't know about any changes. But the changes after B left only involved the orange moving around (bag → box → bag → box). The banana stayed in the basket the whole time.

So B should know the basket contains a banana. B saw himself put the banana in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that (even before B left). So B should correctly answer "banana" for the basket.

Since B already knows the correct answer (banana is in the basket), I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

B answers: banana

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a brick in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. C moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (A, B, C see this)
5. B puts a banana in the basket. (A, B, C see this)
6. B leaves the room.
7. C moves the brick from the bag to the box. (Only A and C see this)
8. C moves the banana from the basket to the bag. (Only A and C see this)
9. C moves the banana from the bag to the basket. (Only A and C see this)

So the current state is:
- Bag: empty
- Box: brick
- Basket: banana

Now, what does B know? B saw steps 1-5, then left. From B's perspective when leaving:
- Bag: brick
- Basket: banana
- Box: empty

B doesn't know about steps 7-9 (the moves after B left).

So B would think the basket contains a **banana**, which happens to also be the correct answer! The banana was moved from basket to bag and back to basket, so it ended up back in the basket.

Since B's belief (banana in the basket) matches reality (banana in the basket), B should answer correctly without my help. I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: The scenario is straightforward. I was in the room when B put a stapler in the basket, and B was the one who did it. So B knows what's in the basket - it's a stapler. B hasn't been in the room since leaving, and nothing happened after B left that would change the basket's contents.

Since B already knows the answer (B put the stapler in the basket themselves), there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

However, I need to consider whether C (a Red team player) might try to deceive B. But since Ask/Tell actions are private between two players, C can't interfere with B's answer unless C gets a turn to Tell B misleading information.

Since B directly placed the stapler in the basket and nothing changed after that, B should confidently know the answer is "stapler." No action is needed from me.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

B was in the room when they put a stapler in the basket. Then B left the room. After B left, various movements happened with the apple, but the basket was never touched again - the stapler is still in the basket.

B knows:
- B put a stapler in the basket (B saw this)
- After B left, B doesn't know what happened in the room

So B should know the basket contains the stapler, since B put it there and has no reason to think it was moved (B was outside and wouldn't know about any changes, but in fact the basket wasn't touched after B left).

Since B will be asked what's in the basket, and B knows the stapler is in the basket (B put it there), and the stapler is indeed still in the basket (nobody moved it), B should answer correctly without any help from me.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. B puts a banana in the basket. (B and I both see this)
2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. C moves the banana from the basket to the bag.
4. C puts an orange in the basket.
5. C moves the orange from the basket to the box.
6. C moves the banana from the bag to the basket.

So the current state is:
- Basket: banana
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty

B's perspective: B last saw the banana in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about any changes C made. So B would think the basket still contains the banana.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to B.

The basket currently contains the banana. B believes the basket contains the banana (from when B put it there). So B would answer "banana" which is actually correct!

Since B will likely answer correctly without any help from me, I should Pass to avoid spending 0.5 points. Telling B the correct answer would cost 0.5 points but B already knows (or at least believes) the correct answer.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts an orange in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
4. D moves the orange from the box to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
5. C moves the orange from the basket to the box. (B doesn't see this)
6. D moves the orange from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
7. D puts a ball in the box. (B doesn't see this)
8. C leaves the room.

So the current state is:
- Bag: orange
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

B last saw the orange being put in the box, then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B would think the box still contains the orange.

But the actual answer is that the box contains a **ball**.

Since I'll be asked about what B thinks is in the box — wait, no. The question is asking B what is in the box. B needs to answer correctly (the actual contents) for our team to get a point.

B thinks the box has an orange, but the correct answer is a ball. I need to tell B what's actually in the box.

Tell(B, box, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the best action here.

Let me analyze what each player knows:

**Me (A):** I saw everything. The box currently contains a **ball**. The bag contains the **apple**. The basket is empty.

**B:** B saw me put the apple in the box, then B left the room. B doesn't know about C moving the apple to the bag or C putting a ball in the box. So B thinks the box contains the **apple**.

**C:** C knows everything (was in the room the whole time). C knows the box contains a **ball**.

**D:** D saw me put the apple in the box, then D left the room. D doesn't know about the subsequent changes. D thinks the box contains the **apple**.

**The question will be asked to B:** "What is in the box?"

B thinks the box contains an apple, but it actually contains a ball. B will answer incorrectly unless I tell B the truth.

I should tell B what's actually in the box so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The Tell action costs 0.5 points, but a correct answer gives 1 point, so we'd net +0.5 points.

Tell(B, box, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

So currently:
- Box contains: **ball**

- Bag contains: **empty**

B left before any changes happened after the apple was placed in the box. So B thinks the box still contains the apple. B will answer "apple" which is **wrong**.

I need to tell B that the box contains a ball so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the basket.

Let me trace through the scenario from B's perspective:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room.
2. C puts a ball in the basket - B sees this.
3. C leaves the room - B is still in the room.
4. D puts an apple in the bag - B sees this.
5. B moves the apple from the bag to the box - B does this.
6. D moves the apple from the box to the bag - B sees this.
7. B moves the apple from the bag to the box - B does this.

B was in the room the entire time and saw C put the ball in the basket. The ball was never moved from the basket. So B knows the basket contains a ball.

Since B knows the correct answer (ball in the basket), I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the basket.

Let me trace through what B observed:

1. **B is in the room**: C puts a brick in the basket. (B sees this)
2. **B leaves the room.**
3. **B is outside**: D moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (B does NOT see this)
4. **B enters the room.**
5. **B is in the room**: C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (B sees this)
6. **C leaves the room.**

So B saw:
- C put a brick in the basket (step 1)
- C moved the brick from the bag to the basket (step 5)

B knows the brick is currently in the basket. B saw C move the brick from the bag to the basket, so B knows the basket contains the brick.

The actual contents of the basket: the brick (C moved it back to the basket in step 5).

B should be able to answer correctly that the basket contains a brick. No need to spend points on a Tell action.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: Looking at this scenario, I need to figure out what B knows about the box.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Everyone starts in the room. D puts a ball in the box.
2. D leaves the room.
3. C leaves the room.
4. B moves the ball from the box to the bag.
5. I put an apple in the box.
6. B moves the ball from the bag to the basket.
7. I move the ball from the basket to the bag.
8. B moves the ball from the bag to the basket.

B was in the room the entire time, so B saw everything that happened. B knows:
- The ball was moved around and ended up in the basket
- I put an apple in the box (step 5)
- Nothing else was done to the box after that

So B knows the box contains an apple. B will answer correctly.

Since B already knows the correct answer (apple is in the box), there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the bag.

Let me trace through the events from B's perspective:

1. B is in the room: D puts a stapler in the bag. (B sees this)
2. B leaves the room.
3. C moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
4. B enters the room.
5. D puts a ball in the bag. (B sees this)
6. D leaves the room.
7. C leaves the room.
8. B moves the stapler from the bag to the box. (Wait - B can't move the stapler from the bag because the stapler isn't in the bag anymore. Let me re-read.)

Wait, let me re-read the scenario carefully. The scenario says "B moves the stapler from the bag to the box." But the stapler was moved to the basket by C while B was out. So when B returns, B doesn't know the stapler was moved. But the scenario describes what actually happens - so somehow B moves the stapler... 

Hmm, actually when D puts a ball in the bag (step 5), B is in the room and sees this. But the stapler was already moved to the basket by C. So the bag only has the ball. Then "B moves the stapler from the bag to the box" - this is confusing because the stapler isn't in the bag. 

Wait, let me re-read: After C moves stapler to basket, B enters. D puts ball in bag. D leaves. C leaves. Then "B moves the stapler from the bag to the box." 

Perhaps this is an error, or perhaps B thought the stapler was still in the bag and actually moved the ball? No - the scenario describes what actually happens. If B moved the stapler from the bag to the box, but the stapler is in the basket... 

I think the scenario is authoritative about what happens. Maybe B found the stapler somehow. But more likely, B moved what B thought was the stapler. Actually, the scenario states facts. If it says B moves the stapler from the bag to the box, that's what happened. But the stapler is in the basket...

I'll take the scenario literally: B moved the ball (thinking it was the stapler?) - no, the scenario says stapler. Let me just accept it as stated.

After everything: I put an apple in the bag. B saw me do this. So B knows the bag has an apple.

B should know the bag contains an apple since B was present when I put it there.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Now, when I put the banana in the basket, B was outside the room. So B doesn't know what's in the basket. B entered the room after that, but players cannot see inside containers - they only observe events that happen while they're present.

After B entered (step 5), the events that happened in the room while B was present were: C enters, I leave, C leaves, C enters. No one moved the banana. But B doesn't know what happened while B was away.

So B doesn't know the basket contains a banana. I need to tell B.

Since B is my teammate and I need B to answer correctly about the basket, I should tell B.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the bag. ... C puts a ball in the basket. ... You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

Action: Let me think through this carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the bag (I saw this).
- C put a ball in the basket (I saw this).
- I left the room, then B left the room.
- After I left, things may have happened that I don't know about. After B left, things may have happened that neither B nor I know about.

**What B knows:**
- B put an apple in the bag.
- C put a ball in the basket.
- After I left, B was still in the room, so B saw anything that happened between my departure and B's departure.
- After B left, B doesn't know what happened.

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the bag.

B knows that they put an apple in the bag. B also stayed in the room after I left, so B would have seen if anything changed with the bag before B left. After B left, C and/or D might still be in the room and could have changed the bag's contents - but B wouldn't know about that.

**Key consideration:** After B left, C and D could still be in the room (the scenario doesn't say they left). They could have moved the apple out of the bag or replaced it. But neither B nor I would know about this.

Since B was in the room after I left, B actually has **more** information than I do about the bag. B would know the state of the bag at the time B left. I don't have any additional information that B lacks about the bag.

Therefore, telling B something would not help - B already knows at least as much as I do about the bag. Asking B would cost 0.5 points and B already knows what they know. There's no useful action I can take here.

Pass
B answers: apple

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:
- Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room.
- B puts an apple in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
- D puts a brick in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
- I (A) leave the room. (After this, I don't know what happens inside.)
- B leaves the room. (B also doesn't know what happened between my leaving and B's leaving.)

So at the time B left the room, B knew:
- Bag: apple (B put it there)
- Basket: brick (D put it there)
- Box: empty

But wait - between when I left and when B left, something could have happened (C and D were still in the room). However, B was still in the room during that time, so B would have seen anything that happened. The scenario shows "..." between my leaving and B leaving, but from B's perspective, B was still in the room and would be aware of any changes.

Actually, looking at the scenario more carefully: "You leave the room. ... B leaves the room." The ellipsis between these events means time passed. During that time, B was still in the room with C and D. B would have observed anything that happened. But from MY perspective, I don't know what happened during that time.

Since B was in the room the entire time until B left, B knows the state of all containers at the moment B left. B has full knowledge of the bag's contents.

The question is: will B know the correct answer? B was present for everything until B left. After B left, C and D might have changed things, but the question is about what's in the bag NOW (at the end of the scenario).

After B left, C and D are still in the room and could have moved things. But we don't know if they did.

From the scenario as described to me, nothing else happened that I'm aware of after B left (since I'm outside too). But C and D could have done things.

Given that B was in the room after I left and saw everything up to when B left, B likely knows what was in the bag when B left. The risk is that C or D changed things after B left.

Since B has good knowledge and the question is directed at B, and B saw everything up until leaving, I should consider whether to help B or not. B already knows what was in the bag when B left. The main risk is if C or D moved the apple after B left.

I don't have any additional information that B doesn't have. In fact, B has MORE information than I do (B saw what happened between my departure and B's departure). So telling B something wouldn't help, and asking B would cost points.

Pass
B answers: apple

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag now and whether B knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. **All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.** B puts a stapler in the bag. Everyone sees this.
2. **I (A) leave the room.** I can no longer see what happens inside.
3. **B leaves the room.** B also can no longer see what happens inside. At this point, D and possibly others are still inside.
4. **C leaves the room.** Now only D is in the room. D could have done anything while alone (or with C after I left).
5. **C enters the room.** Now C and D are in the room. They could do things.
6. **B enters the room.** Now B, C, and D are in the room. B can see what happens from this point.
7. **B leaves the room.** 

The key question: After I left, D was in the room (and C was too for a while). They could have moved the stapler out of the bag or put something else in. Then C re-entered, and B re-entered briefly.

B's knowledge: B knows the stapler was in the bag when B left. When B re-entered, B wouldn't automatically know the bag's contents (players can't see inside containers). B would only know if something happened to the bag while B was present during the re-entry. Since nothing is described as happening while B was back in the room, B still thinks the stapler is in the bag based on last known state.

But the actual contents could have changed while only D (and later C) were in the room. Since I don't know what D did, and B doesn't know either, B will likely answer "stapler" based on last known information.

The question is whether D or C moved the stapler. Since I have no information about what happened, and B likely believes it's still a stapler, B's best guess would be "stapler."

Since B likely already believes the bag contains a stapler (which was the last thing B knew before leaving, and nothing observable happened when B re-entered), telling B what I know doesn't add new information. B's knowledge matches mine.

I'll pass to save points.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- I put a stapler in the bag.
- C was in the room when I put the stapler in the bag, so C knows the bag contains a stapler.
- C then left the room, followed by B leaving.
- Nothing else happened to the bag after C left, so the bag still contains a stapler.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag.

Since C was present when I put the stapler in the bag, C knows the correct answer is "stapler." C is on the Red team, so if C answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?** 

- I could Tell C false information, like Tell(C, bag, something_else), but C already knows what's in the bag because C witnessed it. C would have no reason to believe my lie over their own observation.
- I could Ask or Tell B, but B isn't the one being asked.
- Any Ask or Tell action costs 0.5 points and wouldn't help here.

Since C directly observed me putting the stapler in the bag, C knows the answer. There's nothing I can do to change C's knowledge or prevent C from answering correctly. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell with false information would be wasteful since C has no reason to trust it over their own observation.

The best action is to not waste points.

C answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What C saw before leaving:**
- I put a stapler in the bag
- The box and basket were empty

**After C left:**
- B left the room
- D put a ball in the box
- I moved the ball from box to basket
- D moved the ball from basket to box

**C's knowledge:**
- Bag: stapler (C saw this)
- Box: empty (from C's perspective, nothing happened to it before C left)
- Basket: empty (from C's perspective)

Since C saw me put the stapler in the bag, C should know the bag contains a stapler. The question is asking C what's in the bag, and C should correctly answer "stapler" since C witnessed that and nothing happened to the bag after C left.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (earning Red 1 point), I should consider whether I can do anything to prevent this. 

I could try to Tell C false information about the bag to confuse them, but C directly saw me put the stapler in the bag. C might be suspicious of me (a Blue team player) telling them something different from what they witnessed. A rational C would likely trust their own observation over my claim.

However, it's worth trying to mislead C since the cost is only 0.5 points, and if it works, it prevents Red from gaining 1 point (net benefit of 0.5 points for my team).

Let me tell C something false about the bag to try to confuse them:

Tell(C, bag, ball)
C answers: ball

Action: I need to think about what C knows and whether I need to help C answer correctly.

C is on the Red team, so I actually **don't** want C to answer correctly - that would give the Red team a point.

Let me think about what C knows:
- C was in the room when I put a stapler in the bag.
- C then left the room.
- After C left: B left, D put a brick in the box, I moved the brick from box to basket, I moved the brick from basket to box, D moved the brick from box to basket.
- None of these actions involved the bag, so the bag still contains the stapler.

C saw me put the stapler in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. So C should know the bag contains a stapler.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (stapler), there's not much I can do to prevent that. I could try to Tell C wrong information to mislead them, but C saw me put the stapler in the bag themselves, so they'd likely trust their own observation over anything I tell them.

Let me consider: If I Tell C something false about the bag, C might be suspicious since they saw me put the stapler in. It would cost me 0.5 points and likely not change C's answer.

The best action is to Pass, since spending 0.5 points to try to mislead C (who already knows the correct answer from direct observation) would likely just cost us points without any benefit.

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether I should help C or not.

Let me trace through the events from C's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room. I put a ball in the bag. (C sees this)
2. C leaves the room. (C misses everything after this)

From C's perspective, the last thing C saw was the ball being placed in the bag. C doesn't know about any subsequent moves.

Now let me trace what actually happened:
1. Ball → bag
2. C leaves
3. B moves ball from bag → box
4. D puts orange in bag
5. B moves orange from bag → basket
6. D moves ball from box → bag
7. B leaves

So the bag currently contains: **the ball**

C's best guess would be that the ball is still in the bag (since that's the last thing C saw before leaving). And that happens to be correct! After all the moves, the ball ended up back in the bag.

Since C is on the Red team (my opponent), I do NOT want to help C. But C's natural guess (ball in the bag) is actually correct.

Could I mislead C? I could tell C something false about the bag's contents. But C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Let me think about whether telling C false information is worth the 0.5 point cost. If C already believes the ball is in the bag (which is correct), then telling C something false might or might not change C's answer. C knows I'm on the opposing team and might ignore my lie. In that case, I'd lose 0.5 points for nothing.

If I pass, C will likely guess "ball" (correct) and Red gets 1 point. Score: Blue=0, Red=1.

If I tell C something false (e.g., "the bag has an orange") and C believes me, Red gets 0 points but I spent 0.5. Score: Blue=-0.5, Red=0. That's better for Blue relatively.

But if C doesn't believe me, Score: Blue=-0.5, Red=1. That's worse.

C might reason: "A is my opponent, why would A help me? A is probably lying." So C would likely ignore my tell.

The risk of losing 0.5 points for nothing is significant. I think the safest play is to Pass.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player saw:

**C's perspective:**
- C was in the room when D put an apple in the basket.
- C was in the room when B left.
- C was in the room when D moved the apple from the basket to the bag.
- C was in the room when D put a stapler in the basket.
- Then C left the room.

So C knows the basket contains a **stapler**. C will answer correctly.

Since C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the basket, C knows the answer (stapler) and will answer correctly, giving Red 1 point. There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly - C saw the stapler being placed in the basket before leaving.

Any Tell or Ask action would cost my team 0.5 points and wouldn't change C's answer (C already knows the truth). So the best action is to Pass.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what I should do.

Let me trace through what C saw before leaving the room:

1. D puts an apple in the basket (everyone sees this)
2. B leaves the room
3. D moves the apple from the basket to the bag (C sees this)
4. D puts a stapler in the basket (C sees this)
5. C leaves the room

After C left:
- I moved the apple from the bag to the box
- D moved the apple from the box to the bag
- I moved the apple from the bag to the box

So C knows that when they left, the **basket had a stapler** and the **bag had an apple**. C doesn't know about any changes after they left.

The question is: "What is in the basket?"

C last saw a stapler being put in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that. So the basket still contains the stapler. C should correctly answer "stapler" based on their own knowledge.

Since C is on the Red team, if C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. I want to prevent that.

I could Tell C false information about the basket to try to mislead them. But C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. However, it's worth trying since it only costs 0.5 points. If C believes me and answers wrong, Red gets 0 points and we only lose 0.5. If C doesn't believe me, Red gets 1 point and we lose 0.5, netting us at -0.5 vs Red at 1.0.

The risk is: if C ignores my lie, we're at -0.5 and Red is at 1.0. If C believes my lie, we're at -0.5 and Red is at 0.0.

C might reason that since I'm on the opposing team, I'd have incentive to lie. So C would likely ignore my Tell. This makes the Tell action likely to just cost us 0.5 points for nothing.

On the other hand, C saw the stapler go in the basket and nothing changed with the basket after C left. C's knowledge is solid here. A lie is unlikely to work.

I'll Pass to avoid losing points.

Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether I should help C or not.

Let me trace through what C saw before leaving:

1. Everyone starts in the room. D puts an apple in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the apple from the basket to the bag.
4. D puts a stapler in the basket.
5. C leaves the room.

So when C left, C saw:
- Bag: apple
- Basket: stapler
- Box: empty

After C left:
- D moved the apple from the bag to the box
- I moved the apple from the box to the bag
- D moved the apple from the bag to the box

Current actual state:
- Bag: empty
- Basket: stapler
- Box: apple

C is on the Red team. The question is asking C what's in the basket. From C's perspective, the last thing C saw was a stapler being put in the basket, and nothing has happened to the basket since then. So C should correctly answer "stapler" since the basket still contains the stapler.

If C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. I should try to mislead C if possible.

I could Tell C false information about the basket. For example, I could tell C that the basket contains something else, hoping C doubts their own memory. But C saw the stapler placed in the basket before leaving, so C might not believe me. However, it costs 0.5 points to Tell, so if C doesn't believe me, we lose 0.5 points for nothing.

The risk is: spending 0.5 points to try to deceive C, but C likely trusts their own observation. Since C directly saw the stapler placed in the basket and has no reason to think it moved, C will probably stick with "stapler" regardless of what I say.

I think the best action is to Pass, since the cost of a Tell likely outweighs the small chance of successfully deceiving C.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what I should do.

Let me trace through what C saw before leaving the room:

1. D puts a ball in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
2. B leaves the room. (Everyone knows this)
3. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. (C, A, D see this)
4. D puts a stapler in the basket. (C, A, D see this)
5. C leaves the room. (C leaves at this point)

So C's last knowledge of the room:
- Bag: ball
- Basket: stapler
- Box: empty

After C left:
6. D moves the ball from the bag to the box.
7. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.
8. D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket.

So the actual current state:
- Bag: empty
- Basket: stapler
- Box: ball

C will be asked what's in the basket. C last saw the stapler in the basket. The actual answer is also the stapler (since D moved it out and then back). So C would likely answer "stapler" which is correct!

This means if C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. I should consider whether I can mislead C.

If I tell C something false about the basket, C might change their answer. Since C is on the Red team, they might be suspicious of information from me (Blue team). However, there's a chance they might second-guess themselves.

Let me try to mislead C by telling them something false about the basket.

Tell(C, basket, ball)
C answers: ball
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- I put a banana in the basket.
- D was in the room when I put the banana in the basket, so D saw this happen.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, nothing else happened (no objects were moved).

**So D knows the basket contains a banana.**

Since D was present when I put the banana in the basket, and nothing changed after D left, D already knows the correct answer. D will be asked what's in the basket, and D knows it's a banana.

However, D is on the Red team. If D answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point. There's nothing I can do to prevent D from knowing the answer — D saw me put the banana in the basket.

Could I try to deceive D with a Tell action? I could tell D something false, like "Tell(D, basket, apple)" to try to make D doubt their own memory. But D saw me put the banana in the basket directly, so D would likely trust their own observation over my claim. Plus, it would cost my team 0.5 points.

The best action here is to Pass, since:
1. Any Tell to D trying to deceive would cost 0.5 points and is unlikely to work since D directly observed the event.
2. Any Ask or Tell to B serves no purpose since B isn't being asked.
3. Spending points on a low-probability deception isn't worth it.

Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the right answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario from D's perspective:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room with empty bag, box, and basket.
2. I put a banana in the basket - D sees this.
3. D leaves the room - from this point, D doesn't see what happens inside.
4. C puts a stapler in the bag - D doesn't see this.
5. I move the stapler from the bag to the box - D doesn't see this.
6. B moves the stapler from the box to the bag - D doesn't see this.

So the current state is:
- Basket: banana
- Bag: stapler
- Box: empty

D knows the banana was put in the basket (D saw that). D left before anything else happened. So D should know the basket contains a banana.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to D.

D is on the Red team. D saw the banana go into the basket and then left. Nothing happened to the basket after D left - the banana is still there. So D should correctly know the answer is "banana."

Since D (Red team) will likely answer correctly (getting Red 1 point), and I can't prevent that, there's no benefit to spending 0.5 points on an action. D is on the opposing team, so if I Tell D wrong information, D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). It would cost me 0.5 points and likely not change D's answer since D directly saw the banana placed in the basket.

Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room when I put a banana in the basket. ✓ D knows basket has banana.
2. D leaves the room.
3. After D left: I put orange in bag, B moved orange to box, C moved orange to bag, B moved orange to box.

D doesn't know about any of the orange movements, but D **does** know the banana was put in the basket. Since nothing happened to the basket after that, the basket still contains the banana.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to D.

D knows the banana was placed in the basket before they left. Nothing happened to the basket after D left (all the movements involved the orange between bag and box). So D should correctly know the basket contains a banana.

Since D is on the Red team, if D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. I want to prevent that.

Could I tell D something false to mislead them? I could tell D that the basket contains something else, but D saw me put the banana in the basket with their own eyes. D would likely not trust a false Tell from an opposing team player, since they have direct knowledge.

Telling D false information would cost me 0.5 points and likely wouldn't work since D has firsthand knowledge of the basket's contents.

The best action is to Pass, since any action I take would either cost points without benefit or potentially help the opposing team.

Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would best help my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room initially and saw me put a ball in the basket.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: C moved the ball from basket to bag, B put a stapler in the basket, C moved the stapler from basket to box, B moved the ball from bag to basket.

D doesn't know about any of the moves after leaving. D thinks the ball is still in the basket (which is actually correct now, since B moved the ball back to the basket).

So D will likely answer "ball" for the basket, which is correct! The ball IS in the basket currently.

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider whether I can mislead D. But wait - D is on the Red team, so if I tell D something false, it might cause D to answer incorrectly, which would benefit my team.

D believes the ball is in the basket. The actual contents of the basket IS the ball. So D would answer correctly.

I could tell D something false to confuse them - like telling D the basket contains something else. But D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

However, there's a chance D might second-guess themselves if I tell them something different. Let me try to mislead D.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room when I put a ball in the bag. So D knows the bag contains a ball.
2. D leaves the room.
3. After D leaves: B moves the ball from the bag to the box, and C puts a banana in the bag.
4. D doesn't see any of these changes.

So D thinks the bag still contains a ball. But the bag actually contains a banana.

D will be asked what's in the bag. D will likely answer "ball" (which is wrong - the correct answer is "banana"). Since D is on the Red team, if D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point, which is good for us.

Now, should I Tell D the correct contents? No! That would help the Red team and cost us 0.5 points.

Should I Tell D incorrect information? That would cost 0.5 points, but D already believes wrong information (ball instead of banana), so it's unnecessary.

The best action is to Pass - D already has incorrect information and will likely answer "ball" which is wrong.

1. Everyone starts in the room. The bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. I put a ball in the bag. (D sees this)

4. After D leaves: B moves ball from bag to box, C puts banana in bag, B leaves, I move ball from box to basket, C moves ball from basket to box, I move ball from box to basket.

So D last saw: ball in the bag, box empty, basket empty. D doesn't know about any changes after leaving.

Current actual state:
- Bag: banana
- Basket: ball
- Box: empty

D will be asked what's in the bag. D likely thinks the ball is still in the bag (since that's what D last saw). D would answer "ball" which is **wrong**. The correct answer is "banana."

Since D is on the Red team, I actually **want** D to answer incorrectly. If D answers "ball" (which is wrong), Red doesn't get a point. That's good for my team.

If I Tell D the truth, D would answer correctly and Red gets a point. That's bad for me.

I could Tell D a lie to reinforce their wrong belief, but that costs 0.5 points and D is already likely to answer wrong.

I could also Tell D a lie that's different from what they already believe, which might confuse them but is unnecessary.

D is on the Red team. If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. If D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points.

Since D is on the opposing team, I want D to answer incorrectly. D currently thinks the bag has a ball, which is wrong (it has a banana). So D is likely to answer incorrectly on their own.

If I Tell D the truth (banana), that would help the Red team - bad for me.
If I Tell D a lie, D might get confused but D already has the wrong answer, so telling a lie could accidentally make things worse or keep things the same.

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room initially and saw me put an orange in the bag.
- D then left the room.
- After D left: C moved orange from bag to basket, B moved orange from basket to bag, B moved orange from bag to box, C put banana in bag, B left.
- D doesn't know about any of these moves after leaving.
- So D thinks the **bag still contains the orange**.

**What's actually in the bag:** A banana (C put it there).

Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer incorrectly. D currently believes the bag has an orange, which is wrong. If I do nothing, D will likely say "orange" and get it wrong, meaning Red doesn't score.

**What I know:**
- C put a banana in the bag, then left the room.
- After C left, D moved the banana from the bag to the box, and put a ball in the bag.
- C doesn't know about D's actions (C was outside the room), so C thinks the banana is still in the bag.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag.

**What C believes:** C thinks the banana is in the bag (since C left before D made changes).

**What's actually in the bag:** A ball.

So C will likely answer "banana," which is **wrong**. That's good for my team (Blue)!

**Should I take an action?**
- If I Tell C the truth (that the bag has a ball), C might answer correctly, giving Red a point. That would be bad for me.
- If I Tell C something false, it costs 0.5 points and C might or might not believe me.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a banana in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... D puts a ball in the bag. ... You move the banana from the box to the basket. ... D moves the banana from the basket to the box. ... You move the banana from the box to the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what C saw:
- C was in the room initially and put a banana in the bag.
- B leaves the room (C sees this).
- C leaves the room.
- After C leaves: D moves banana from bag to box, D puts ball in bag, I move banana from box to basket, D moves banana from basket to box, I move banana from box to basket.

C doesn't know about any of these changes after leaving. C last saw the banana in the bag. So C will likely answer "banana" for the bag.

But the bag currently contains a **ball**.

So C will likely answer incorrectly (saying "banana"), which means Red gets 0 points from this question. That's good for us.

However, could C get help? Let me think about the turn order. It's my turn now. After my action, there may be other turns before the answer phase. But I should consider whether D could tell C the correct answer.

D was in the room the whole time and knows the bag contains a ball. If D gets a turn before C answers, D could Tell(C, bag, ball), which would cost Red 0.5 points but gain them 1 point (net +0.5).

My options:
1. **Pass** - costs nothing. C will likely answer "banana" (wrong). But D might get a turn to correct C.
2. **Tell(C, bag, banana)** - reinforce C's wrong belief, but costs us 0.5 points. C might trust this or might not.
3. **Tell(C, bag, some wrong answer)** - try to confuse C, but costs 0.5 points.

If I Tell C the wrong thing, it costs us 0.5 points, and C already believes "banana" anyway. If D then tells C "ball," C might be confused between my answer and D's answer. But C might trust D (teammate) over me.

The best play is likely **Pass**. C already has the wrong belief. If D corrects C, it costs Red 0.5 points. If D doesn't get a turn or passes, C answers wrong and Red gets 0.

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What C saw before leaving:**
- C put a banana in the bag
- C was in the room the whole time until they left
- B left the room (C saw this)
- Then C left the room

**After C left:**
- D moved the banana from the bag to the box
- D put a ball in the bag
- I moved the banana from the box to the basket
- I moved the banana from the basket to the box

**So C believes:** The banana is still in the bag (since C left before any changes were made to the bag's contents).

**Current actual state:**
- Bag: ball
- Box: banana
- Basket: empty

**C will be asked what's in the bag.** C likely thinks the banana is in the bag, so C will probably answer "banana." The correct answer is "ball." If C answers wrong, Red gets 0 points. If C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

Now, should I use Tell to mislead or help? 

- If I Tell C the truth (bag contains ball), C might answer correctly, giving Red 1 point. That costs me 0.5 points too. Net: Red +1, Blue -0.5. Bad for me.
- If I Tell C something false, C might get confused. But C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.
- If I Pass, C will likely answer "banana" (wrong), and Red gets 0 points.

The best action is to Pass. C will likely answer incorrectly based on their outdated information, and my team loses no points.

C answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- C put a brick in the box, then left the room.
- After C left, D moved the brick around and eventually put it in the bag, then put a ball in the box.
- C doesn't know about any of D's moves since C was outside the room.
- C thinks the brick is still in the box (that's what C last saw).

**The question:** I will be asked to C what is in the box.

**What C will likely answer:** C will probably say "brick" because that's what C last saw in the box. But the actual contents of the box is a "ball."

**The correct answer is "ball"** - but C doesn't know this.

**My options:**
- I could Tell C the truth about the box contents so C answers correctly. But C is on the Red team - if C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. That would be bad for me.
- I could Pass and let C answer incorrectly (C will likely say "brick"), which means Red gets 0 points.
- I could Tell C wrong information, but C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Since C is on the **Red team**, I do NOT want C to answer correctly. C likely thinks the box contains a brick (which is wrong - it actually contains a ball). If I do nothing, C will probably answer incorrectly, and Red won't score.

If I tell C the truth, I'd be helping the Red team score, which hurts my team.

The best action is to **Pass** - let C answer with their outdated information, which will likely be wrong.

Pass
C answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Let me analyze what each player knows:

**Me (A):** I saw everything. The bag currently contains a ball, the box contains the orange, and the basket is empty.

**B:** B was in the room the whole time. B saw D put the orange in the bag, saw D and C leave, saw me move the orange from the bag to the box, and saw themselves put a ball in the bag. B knows the bag has a ball.

**C:** C saw D put the orange in the bag. Then C left the room. C doesn't know about any changes after that. C thinks the bag still has the orange.

**D:** D put the orange in the bag, then left. D doesn't know about any changes after that. D thinks the bag still has the orange.

**The question is for C: "What is in the bag?"**

C will likely answer "orange" because that's what C last saw. The actual contents of the bag is a ball, so C would be **wrong**. This is good for the Blue team - Red gets 0 points.

Now, should I use a Tell action to try to mislead C? If I Tell C the bag contains an orange, that would reinforce C's wrong belief... but wait, C already thinks it's an orange, and the actual answer is a ball. C answering "orange" is wrong, which is good for us.

But what if I Tell C the truth (ball)? That would cost us 0.5 points and help Red score 1 point, netting Red +1 and us -0.5. Bad idea.

What if I Tell C something wrong to reinforce the wrong belief? That costs 0.5 points but C is already going to answer wrong. Not worth it.

The best action is to Pass. C will almost certainly answer "orange" (wrong), Red gets no points, and we lose no points.

Pass
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when D put an orange in the bag.
2. D left the room.
3. C left the room.
4. After C left, I moved the orange from bag to box, B put a ball in the bag, I moved orange from box to basket, B moved orange from basket to box, I moved orange from box to basket.

C doesn't know about any of the movements after they left. So C's last knowledge is that the orange is in the bag.

The question is: "What is in the bag?"

Currently, the bag contains a ball (B put a ball in the bag, and it was never moved out).

C will likely answer "orange" since that's what they last saw in the bag. That would be wrong - the correct answer is "ball."

Since C is on the Red team, I want C to answer incorrectly. C is already likely to answer "orange" (incorrect), which is good for my team.

I should **Pass** - there's no benefit to spending points. If I tell C the correct answer, that would help the Red team. If I do nothing, C will likely say "orange" which is wrong.

Pass
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be best for my team.

Let me trace through what C saw:
- C was in the room when D put an orange in the bag.
- D left the room (C was still inside).
- C left the room.
- After C left: I moved the orange from the bag to the box, B put a ball in the bag, and B moved the orange around.

So C believes the bag contains the **orange** (since that's the last thing C saw before leaving).

The actual contents of the bag: **ball** (B put a ball in the bag).

The question is being asked to C: "What is in the bag?" C will likely answer "orange" based on what they know, which is **wrong**. That means the Red team won't score a point.

Since the Red team will likely get this wrong on their own, I don't need to spend points to interfere. I should Pass.

- Then D left the room
- Then C left the room
- After C left, I moved the brick from the bag to the basket, then B moved it back to the bag, then I moved it to the box, and B put a ball in the bag

So C last saw the brick in the bag. C doesn't know about any of the movements that happened after they left. C will likely answer "brick" for the bag, but the bag actually contains a ball.

Since C is on the Red team, I want C to answer incorrectly. C will likely say "brick" (which is wrong - the bag has a ball). That's good for us because C answering wrong means Red doesn't get a point.

However, could C's teammate D help? D left before C, so D also last saw the brick in the bag. D has even less information than C. Neither D nor C knows about the subsequent movements.

If I Pass, C will likely answer "brick" which is incorrect. Red gets 0 points.

If I Tell C the truth (that the bag contains a ball), that would cost us 0.5 points AND help the Red team score 1 point. That's terrible.

If I Tell C a lie, it costs 0.5 points but C might not trust me anyway since I'm on the opposing team.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. D puts a brick in the bag.
2. C leaves the room.
3. D moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (C doesn't see this)
4. C enters the room.
5. D moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (C sees this)
6. A (me) leaves the room.
7. B leaves the room.

After step 5, the brick is in the bag. Then I leave, then B leaves. I don't know if anything happened after I left.

Now, what does C know? C saw the brick go into the bag initially (step 1). C left and missed step 3. C came back and saw step 5 (brick moved from basket to bag). So C knows the brick is in the bag as of step 5.

After step 5, both A and B leave. C and D remain in the room. Something could have happened after I left that I don't know about, but C would know about it since C is still in the room.

The question is asking C what's in the bag. C is on the Red team, so C wants to answer correctly to score for Red. 

Since I don't know what happened after I left (C and D were alone in the room), I can't be sure what's currently in the bag. C, however, would know since C stayed in the room.

There's nothing I can do to help my team here - the question is directed at C (Red team), and C has full knowledge of the current room state since C never left after re-entering. C will likely answer correctly.

I could try to Tell C false information to confuse them, but C was in the room the whole time after re-entering, so C would know I'm lying.

The best action is to Pass, since spending 0.5 points on an Ask or Tell won't help - C has direct knowledge of the room's current state.

Action: The question will be asked to C, who is on the Red team. C was in the room the entire time and witnessed everything that happened, so C knows that the basket contains a banana.

Since C is on the opposing team and knows the correct answer, there's nothing I can do to help or hinder here. C will answer correctly regardless of any action I take. Using Ask or Tell would cost my team 0.5 points for no benefit.

Pass
C answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a banana in the basket. (Everyone sees this: A, B, C, D are all in the room)
2. C puts a ball in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. B moves the ball from the bag to the box. (Everyone sees this)
4. D moves the ball from the box to the bag. (Everyone sees this)
5. I move the ball from the bag to the box. (Everyone sees this)
6. I leave the room. (Everyone knows this)

After I leave, something might happen that I don't know about. But the scenario ends with "..." after I leave, meaning time passes but I'm not told about any specific events inside the room.

The question is: What is in the basket? The answer is **banana** - I put it there and nothing in the scenario moved it.

C was in the room the entire time and saw everything, including me putting the banana in the basket. C knows the basket contains a banana. However, after I left, something could have happened that I'm unaware of - but the scenario doesn't indicate anything happened after I left (the "..." just indicates passage of time).

Wait - C is on the Red team. C knows the answer is "banana" since C saw me put it there and nothing moved it. C has no reason to answer incorrectly since answering correctly gives the Red team a point.

Actually, C will be asked by the game master, and C must answer. C knows the banana is in the basket (C was present when I put it there, and nothing moved it while C was in the room... but after I left, things could have happened that I don't know about).

Since I left the room, I don't know if anything changed after I left. But C is still in the room and would know the current state. C is on the Red team and will answer correctly to earn a point for Red.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly - C has full knowledge. Any Tell action would cost us 0.5 points and C would ignore misinformation. Any Ask would also cost 0.5 points unnecessarily.

Pass
C answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put an orange in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the orange from the basket to the bag. ... C enters the room. ... You move the orange from the bag to the basket. ... You leave the room. ...

I am going to ask C what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what C knows about the basket and whether I need to take any action.

Let me trace through what C has seen:

1. **Everyone in room**: I put an orange in the basket. (C sees this)
2. **C leaves the room**: C is now outside.
3. **While C is outside**: D moves the orange from the basket to the bag. (C does NOT see this)
4. **C enters the room**: C is back inside.
5. **After C returns**: I move the orange from the bag to the basket. (C sees this)
6. **I leave the room**: I'm now outside.

So what does C know? 
- C saw me put the orange in the basket initially.
- C was outside when D moved the orange to the bag, so C missed that.
- C came back and saw me move the orange from the bag to the basket. This is interesting - C would see me move the orange from the bag to the basket, which might surprise C (since C last knew the orange was in the basket), but C does witness this action.
- After step 5, C knows the orange is in the basket.

Now, after I left the room, C and D are still in the room. I don't know if anything happened after I left. But the scenario doesn't mention any further actions after I leave - just "..." which means time passes but I'm not told of any movements (since I'm outside).

However, C and D (both Red team) are in the room together. They could have moved the orange after I left. But the scenario as described to me doesn't show any further movements - though I wouldn't see them since I'm outside.

The question is asking C what's in the basket. C is on the Red team, so C will try to answer correctly to score for Red. 

If nothing moved after I left, the orange is in the basket, and C knows this - C would answer correctly.

If D moved the orange after I left, C would have seen it and would know the new location.

Since I can't affect C's answer (C is on the opposing team and won't listen to misinformation from me), and C likely knows the correct answer, I should Pass to avoid losing points.

Pass
C answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. There's an empty bag, empty box, empty basket.
2. D puts a brick in the basket. → Basket has brick.
3. ... I leave the room. → I can't see what happens while I'm out.
4. ... I enter the room. → I can see what happens again.
5. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. → This tells me that while I was out, the brick was moved to the bag (I didn't see this). Now C moves it from the bag back to the basket.
6. C leaves the room.

So after step 5, the basket has the brick.

But wait - I need to consider what else might have happened while I was outside. The scenario only describes what I can see. While I was out, someone moved the brick from the basket to the bag (which I didn't witness directly, but I can infer from step 5). Could other things have happened too?

The scenario describes what I'm aware of. When I'm outside, I only know about players entering/leaving. When I'm inside, I see everything. So after I re-enter, I see C move the brick from the bag to the basket. After that, C leaves.

After step 5, the basket contains the brick. But could something else have happened between step 5 and now? After C leaves, B and D are still in the room with me. The scenario doesn't mention any further actions, so the basket should still contain the brick.

However, I should consider: while I was outside, could additional objects have been placed? I only know what I directly observe. But the scenario as described to me is complete - it shows everything I'm aware of.

The basket contains the brick. I'm confident in this answer.

Pass

Action: I need to think carefully about what I observed.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. There's an empty bag, empty box, and empty basket.
2. C puts a ball in the basket. (I see this.)
3. I leave the room.
4. (While I'm outside, things may happen that I don't see.)
5. I enter the room.
6. C moves the ball from the bag to the basket. (I see this.)

Now, the key observation: When I re-entered the room, I saw C move the ball **from the bag to the basket**. This means that while I was outside, someone must have moved the ball from the basket to the bag. I didn't see that happen, but the fact that C moved it from the bag confirms the ball was in the bag when I returned.

After C moves the ball from the bag to the basket, the ball is now in the basket.

So I know the basket contains the ball. I can answer this directly without needing to ask anyone.

Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events I witnessed:

1. Everyone starts in the room. B leaves.
2. C leaves.
3. I put a brick in the basket.
4. B enters the room.
5. C enters the room.
6. I leave the room.
7. I enter the room.
8. D moves the brick from the basket to the bag.
9. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket.
10. D leaves the room.
11. D enters the room.
12. I leave the room.

After step 9, the brick is in the basket. Then D leaves and enters (steps 10-11), but I was still in the room at that point so I would have seen any moves. Then I leave the room (step 12).

After I leave the room, things could have happened that I'm not aware of. The question is whether anything happened after I left.

At the time I left (step 12), the brick was in the basket. But something might have happened after I left that I can't see.

Since I'm being asked what's in the basket, and I know it was the brick when I left, but I'm uncertain about what happened after I left, I need to consider whether to ask someone.

However, the question is being asked to ME, so I need to answer. Let me think about whether to ask someone who might know what happened after I left.

After I left, B, C, and D were in the room (B entered in step 4, C entered in step 5, D entered in step 11). Any of them could have moved things.

I should ask my teammate B what's in the basket, since B was in the room after I left and would know the current state.

Ask(B, basket)
A answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Action: Pass

The answer to the question is straightforward. I was in the room when D put an orange in the box, and nothing was moved out of the box while I was present. After I left the room, only D and B remained (C had already left), and then D left too. But I need to consider what happened after I left - only B was in the room at that point, and B could have moved something. However, since I'm being asked the question directly, I know that when I left, the orange was in the box. Let me just answer based on what I know.

Wait - I should reconsider. The action phase is separate from the answer phase. I'm choosing my action now, and the question will be asked to me in the answer phase. Since I saw the orange placed in the box and never saw it removed before I left, I'm fairly confident the answer is "orange." After I left, only B remained in the room, and B could theoretically have moved the orange, but I have no indication of that. I'll save the 0.5 points and Pass.

**Pass**
A answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Action: The ball is in the bag. Let me trace through what I know:

1. We all start in the room. C leaves.
2. D puts a ball in the bag. (I see this.)
3. I leave the room.
4. I enter the room.
5. D moves the ball from the bag to the box. (I see this.)
6. D moves the ball from the box to the bag. (I see this.)
7. I leave the room.
8. D leaves the room.

After step 6, the ball is back in the bag. After I leave (step 7), D leaves (step 8). But between steps 7 and 8, D is alone in the room - however, the scenario doesn't mention D doing anything else. But I need to be careful: the scenario only describes what I can observe. When I'm outside the room and D is still inside (between steps 7 and 8), D could have moved the ball without me knowing.

However, the scenario says "D leaves the room" and nothing else is described between my leaving and D leaving. Since I'm outside the room during that time, I wouldn't see any actions D takes. So there's uncertainty about whether D moved the ball.

But given that the question is directed at me and I need to answer, and no additional information suggests D moved anything, the most likely answer is that the ball is still in the bag. I'm fairly confident.

Action: The question will be asked to B about the basket. B was in the room when they put the brick in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that (D just left the room, no objects were moved). So B knows the basket contains a brick.

Since B already knows the correct answer, there's no need to spend points telling them.

B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room.
2. B puts a brick in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens.)
4. D leaves the room.
5. C puts a ball in the bag. (B doesn't see this.)
6. I move the ball from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this.)
7. C moves the ball from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this.)

Current state of containers:
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

B will be asked what's in the basket. B saw the brick being put in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that. So B should know the basket contains a brick.

Since B was present when the brick was placed in the basket, and nothing changed in the basket after B left, B should correctly answer "brick" without any help from me.

I don't need to spend points telling B something they already know.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

B is being asked what's in the basket. Let me trace through what B knows:

1. B was in the room and put a brick in the basket.
2. B then left the room.
3. After B left, various things happened with the banana (moved between bag, box, bag, box), but nothing happened to the basket.

So the basket still contains the brick. B knows he put the brick in the basket, and since B left the room after that, B wouldn't know if anything changed in the basket. But in fact, nothing did change in the basket - the brick is still there.

B should correctly answer "brick" for the basket, since B put it there and has no reason to think it changed (and it didn't change).

Since B will likely answer correctly on their own, I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a banana in the basket.
3. B leaves the room.
4. C moves the banana from the basket to the bag.
5. D puts an orange in the basket.
6. C moves the orange from the basket to the box.
7. D moves the banana from the bag to the basket.
8. D leaves the room.

So the current state is:
- Basket: banana
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty

B left the room after step 2, so B only knows that the banana was in the basket. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. B would think the basket still contains the banana.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to B.

The basket currently contains the banana. B thinks the basket contains the banana (from when B put it there). So B would answer "banana" which is actually correct!

Since B will likely answer correctly without any help, I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

B answers: banana

B was in the room when:

- D left the room
- B moved the apple from the box to the bag
- B put a brick in the box
- B left the room

After B left, I moved the apple around, but the brick stayed in the box. So B knows the brick is in the box (B put it there), and nothing happened to the box after B left.

B should correctly answer "brick" when asked what's in the box. B has full knowledge of this since B was the one who put the brick there, and B has no reason to think it was moved (B left the room after placing it, but the brick was never moved).

Wait - but B doesn't know what happened after leaving. B might worry that someone moved the brick. However, B's best knowledge is that the brick is in the box. B should answer correctly.

Since B should already know the correct answer (brick is in the box), there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

The question is: "What is in the box?"

Let me trace what B knows:
- B was in the room initially and saw D put an apple in the box.
- B was in the room when B moved the apple from the box to the bag.
- B was in the room when B put a brick in the box.
- B then left the room.
- After B left, C moved the apple from the bag to the basket, I moved the apple from the basket to the bag, and C moved the apple from the bag to the basket.

So B knows that when B left, the box contained a brick. B doesn't know about anything that happened after leaving. Since nothing happened to the box after B left (only the apple was moved around), the box still contains a brick.

B should know the answer: the box contains a brick. B was the one who put the brick in the box, and nothing happened to the box after that (even after B left, no one touched the box).

So B should correctly answer "brick" without any help from me. I should Pass to save points.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room.
2. D puts a banana in the bag.
3. D leaves the room.
4. B moves the banana from the bag to the box.
5. B puts a brick in the bag.
6. B leaves the room.
7. C moves the banana from the box to the basket.
8. C moves the brick from the bag to the box.
9. C moves the brick from the box to the bag.

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: brick
- Box: empty
- Basket: banana

**What B knows:**
B was present for steps 1-5, then left at step 6. After leaving, B knows C and I (A) remained in the room, but B doesn't know what happened after they left.

From B's perspective when they left:
- Bag: brick
- Box: banana
- Basket: empty

B doesn't know about steps 7-9 (C's movements). So B would likely answer "brick" for the bag, which happens to be correct! The brick is currently in the bag.

Wait, let me re-check. After C's moves:
- Step 7: banana moves from box to basket
- Step 8: brick moves from bag to box
- Step 9: brick moves from box to bag

So the bag currently contains the **brick**.

B's last knowledge of the bag was that it contained a **brick** (from step 5). So B would naturally answer "brick" for the bag.

Since B's answer would be correct without any intervention, I should Pass to avoid spending points.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A (me), B, and D are in the room. I put a banana in the basket.
2. B leaves the room. (B last saw: banana in basket)
3. After B leaves: D moves banana from basket to bag. D puts brick in basket. D moves brick from basket to box. D moves banana from bag to basket.

So the current state is:
- Basket: banana
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty

B was present when I put the banana in the basket, then B left. B doesn't know about any of the moves D made after leaving. So B would think the basket still contains the banana.

The question is asking B what's in the basket. B's last knowledge is that the banana is in the basket, which happens to also be the correct current state (banana is in the basket).

So B would naturally answer "banana" which is correct! No need to spend points telling B anything.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I saw everything since I was in the room the whole time.
- Bag: brick
- Box: empty
- Basket: ball

**What B knows:** B put a brick in the basket, then left. B didn't see anything after leaving. So B thinks:
- Basket: brick
- Bag: empty
- Box: empty

**What the question is:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the basket. Wait, no - "I am going to ask B what is in the basket." So B will be answering about the basket.

B thinks the basket has a brick (since B left before C moved the brick and D put a ball in). The actual answer is a ball.

B will answer "brick" which is **wrong**. So Blue team gets 0 points from this question.

I should Tell B the correct contents of the basket so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we get 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

If I Pass, B answers "brick" (wrong) and we get 0 points.
If I Tell B the basket has a ball, it costs 0.5 but B can answer "ball" correctly for 1 point, netting +0.5.

B answers: ball

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a brick in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the brick from the basket to the bag. ... D puts a ball in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the brick from the bag to the box. ... You move the brick from the box to the bag. ... C moves the brick from the bag to the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. B puts a brick in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. C moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. D puts a ball in the basket. (B doesn't see this)
5. D leaves the room.
6. C moves the brick from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)
7. I move the brick from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
8. C moves the brick from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)

Current state:
- Basket: ball
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty

B's perspective: B last saw the brick placed in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about any changes after that. So B would think the basket contains the brick.

But the actual answer is that the basket contains a **ball**.

I need to tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Tell(B, basket, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. B puts a brick in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. D puts a ball in the basket. (B doesn't see this)
5. D leaves the room. (B knows D left)
6. C moves the brick from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)
7. I (A) move the brick from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)

Current state of containers:
- Basket: ball
- Bag: brick
- Box: empty

What B knows: B saw the brick go into the basket, then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent changes. So B would think the basket contains the brick.

But the actual answer to "what is in the basket" is the **ball**.

B will be asked what is in the basket. B likely thinks it's the brick, but the correct answer is the ball. I need to tell B the correct answer so our team gets the point.

Tell(B, basket, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a stapler in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ...

----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens inside.)
4. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this.)
5. C moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this.)
6. C moves the stapler from the basket to the box. (B doesn't see this.)
7. D puts a ball in the basket. (B doesn't see this.)
8. D leaves the room. (B doesn't see this.)

So the current state is:
- Bag: empty
- Box: stapler
- Basket: ball

B's knowledge: B last saw the stapler placed in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. B would think the basket still contains the stapler.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the basket?"

B would answer "stapler" based on their knowledge, but the correct answer is "ball."

If B answers incorrectly, Blue gets 0 points. So I should tell B what's actually in the basket so B can answer correctly and earn Blue 1 point. The Tell action costs 0.5 points, so the net gain would be 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 points.

If I Pass, B will likely answer "stapler" (wrong) and we get 0 points.

So telling B is the better option.

Tell(B, basket, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**Me (A):** I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything:
- D put a banana in the bag
- C left the room
- B left the room
- D moved the banana from the bag to the box
- D put a brick in the bag
- So: bag = brick, box = banana, basket = empty

**B:** B saw D put a banana in the bag, then C left, then B left. B did NOT see D move the banana to the box or put a brick in the bag. So B thinks: bag = banana.

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the bag. Wait, no - "I am going to ask B what is in the bag." So B will be asked.

B thinks the bag has a banana (since B left before D moved things around). But the actual contents of the bag is a brick. B will answer "banana" which is **wrong**.

I should Tell B what is actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and our team gets 1 point. The cost is 0.5 points, but the correct answer gives us 1 point, netting +0.5.

If I Pass, B will answer "banana" (incorrect) and we get 0 points.

B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room. D puts a banana in the bag.
2. C leaves the room. (C knows: banana in bag)
3. B leaves the room. (B knows: banana in bag)
4. D moves banana from bag to box. (Only A and D see this)
5. D puts a brick in the bag. (Only A and D see this)
6. I move banana from box to basket. (Only A and D see this)
7. D moves banana from basket to box. (Only A and D see this)
8. I move banana from box to basket. (Only A and D see this)

Current state:
- **Bag**: brick
- **Box**: empty
- **Basket**: banana

B was in the room only for step 1, so B thinks the bag has a banana (which is what B last saw). B doesn't know about any changes after leaving.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the bag?" The correct answer is **brick**.

B thinks the bag has a banana, so B will answer "banana" — which is wrong. I need to tell B the correct contents of the bag.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I saw everything. The bag currently contains a ball, the box contains a banana, and the basket is empty.

**What B knows:** B saw the banana put in the bag, then left. B doesn't know about D moving the banana to the box or C putting a ball in the bag. So B thinks the bag still contains a banana.

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the bag. The correct answer is "a ball."

B will likely answer "banana" based on their outdated knowledge, which would be **wrong**. I need to tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and score a point for our team.

The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points. If I don't tell B, B will almost certainly answer "banana" and get 0 points. So telling is worth it.

Current state:

B's knowledge: B last saw the banana placed in the bag, then left. B doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So B would think the bag still contains the banana.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B.

B thinks the bag contains a banana, but it actually contains a ball.

If I Tell B the correct contents of the bag, B can answer correctly and we get 1 point (minus 0.5 for the Tell action = net 0.5 points).

If I Pass, B will likely answer "banana" which is wrong, and we get 0 points.

So telling B is worth +0.5 net points.

However, I need to consider whether C or D might try to mislead B. But since Ask/Tell actions are private, C and D can't interfere with my Tell to B. Also, it's currently my turn, so only I act now.

The best action is to tell B what's in the bag.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B.

B will likely answer "apple" (which is wrong - the box actually contains a ball).

Since B is my teammate, I should help B get the right answer. I should tell B what's actually in the box.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and C are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a ball in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the ball from the bag to the box. ... B enters the room. ... C puts a brick in the bag. ... C leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the bag.

Let me trace through B's perspective:
1. B is in the room and puts a ball in the bag. B knows: bag has a ball.
2. B leaves the room.
3. While B is outside: C moves the ball from the bag to the box. B doesn't see this.
4. B enters the room. B doesn't know what changed while away.
5. C puts a brick in the bag. B sees this happen. So B now knows a brick was put in the bag.

Wait - does B know the brick is in the bag? B saw C put a brick in the bag. But B might think the ball is still in the bag too... except each container holds at most one object. So if C puts a brick in the bag, B might wonder what happened to the ball.

Actually, B saw C put a brick in the bag while B was present. B knows containers hold at most one object. So B might reason that the ball was removed from the bag at some point while B was outside (since C was able to put a brick in the bag). But B doesn't know where the ball went.

The key question: does B know what's in the bag? B saw C put a brick in the bag, so B should know the bag contains a brick.

Actually, B should correctly answer "brick" for the bag. B witnessed C putting a brick in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. So B should know the answer.

Since B likely knows the correct answer (brick), I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:
1. I put a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this - A, B, C, D all in room)
2. D leaves the room.
3. C leaves the room.
4. B moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (A and B see this)
5. I put a ball in the basket. (A and B see this)
6. B moves the stapler from the bag to the box. (A and B see this)
7. I move the stapler from the box to the bag. (A and B see this)
8. B moves the stapler from the bag to the box. (A and B see this)

Current state:
- Basket: ball
- Box: stapler
- Bag: empty

B was in the room the entire time and witnessed everything, so B knows the basket contains a ball.

Since B knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the basket.

Let me trace through B's perspective:
1. B is in the room: sees me put an orange in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. (B doesn't see C move orange from basket to bag)
4. B enters the room.
5. B sees D move the orange from the bag to the basket.
6. D leaves the room.
7. C leaves the room.
8. B moves the orange from the basket to the box.
9. B sees me put a ball in the basket.

So B knows the ball is in the basket. B was present when I put the ball in the basket.

Since B knows the correct answer (ball is in the basket), I don't need to tell B anything.

B answers: ball

Let me trace through what happened:
- All three of us (A, B, D) were in the room the entire time.
- D put a stapler in the bag — B saw this.
- D put an orange in the basket — B saw this.
- B moved the orange from the basket to the box — B did this.
- I moved the orange from the box to the basket — B saw this.

So B was present for everything, including D putting the stapler in the bag. B knows the bag contains the stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B needs help.

Let me trace through what B saw:

1. B is in the room: D puts a ball in the bag. ✓ B sees this.
2. B leaves the room. B misses what happens next.
3. D moves the ball from the bag to the box. ✗ B doesn't see this.
4. B enters the room. B is now back.
5. D moves the ball from the box to the bag. ✓ B sees this.

Now, when B re-enters the room, B sees D move the ball from the box to the bag. But B didn't know the ball was in the box (B last knew it was in the bag). However, B does witness the action "D moves the ball from the box to the bag" — B sees this happen and knows the ball ends up in the bag.

So B knows the ball is in the bag. The correct answer is "ball" for the bag.

Since B already knows the correct answer, I should Pass to save points.

- B was in the room initially and saw the empty bag, empty box, and empty basket.
- B left the room before anything was placed in any container.
- B doesn't know what happened after leaving.

So B has no idea what's in the basket. The correct answer is that the **stapler** is in the basket (D put a stapler in the basket, and nothing moved it after that).

I should tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly.

Action: The brick was placed in the basket while everyone (A, B, C, D) was in the room. B saw this happen. After that, I left the room, then B left the room.

However, after both A and B left, C and D were still in the room and could have moved the brick or done something else. B wouldn't know about any changes that happened after B left.

But B did see me put the brick in the basket, and B has no information about any changes after leaving. So B should reasonably answer "brick" for the basket.

The risk is that C or D moved the brick after we left, and the question is about what is *actually* in the basket now. If C or D moved it, B's answer of "brick" would be wrong.

Since I can't know what happened after I left, and B also can't know, there's no additional information I can provide to B that B doesn't already have. Telling B "brick is in the basket" is redundant since B saw it happen.

I should Pass to save the 0.5 points, since B already knows what was in the basket when we were both present, and I have no additional information to share.

Pass
B answers: brick
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

Action: The question will be asked to B about the basket's contents.

Let me think about what B knows:

1. B was in the room when I put a brick in the basket - so B saw that.
2. B was in the room when C put a ball in the box - so B saw that.
3. I left the room first, then B left the room.

After B left, we don't know if C or D moved anything. But from B's perspective, the last thing B saw was the brick in the basket.

However, after both A and B left, C and D could have moved objects around. But B wouldn't know about that - B would only know what was in the basket when B last saw it, which was the brick.

Since B was present when I put the brick in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket before B left (the only other action was C putting a ball in the box), B should know the basket contains a brick.

But wait - I need to consider whether C or D might have changed the basket contents after B left. The question is what's *currently* in the basket. If C or D moved the brick out after we left, B wouldn't know.

However, I also don't know what happened after I left (I left before B). Let me reconsider: I left first, then B left. Between my leaving and B leaving, B would have seen anything that happened. But after B left, neither of us knows what happened.

Since B saw the brick in the basket and nothing changed before B left, B's best knowledge is that the brick is in the basket. Since I have the same information, there's no need to spend points telling B something they already know.

The risk is that C or D moved things after we both left, but neither B nor I can know that. B should answer "brick" based on their knowledge.

Pass
B answers: brick

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket now and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I, B, C, and D are all in the room. I put a stapler in the basket. Everyone sees this.
2. I leave the room. B, C, and D remain.
3. B leaves the room. C and D remain.
4. D leaves the room. C is alone in the room.
5. D enters the room. C and D are in the room.
6. B enters the room. B, C, and D are in the room.
7. B leaves the room. C and D are in the room.

The key concern: While C was alone in the room (between steps 3 and 4, after B left and before D left - wait, D was still there). Let me re-trace:

- After I leave: B, C, D in room.
- After B leaves: C, D in room.
- After D leaves: C alone in room.
- C is alone and could have moved the stapler or done anything.
- D enters: C and D in room. Anything C did, D wouldn't know about (if it happened before D entered). But D would see the current state? No - players cannot see inside containers. D only sees actions happening while present.
- B enters: B, C, D in room. Again, B can't see inside containers.
- B leaves.

So B originally saw me put the stapler in the basket. But while B was outside the room, C was alone and could have moved the stapler. When B re-entered, B wouldn't know if anything changed unless something happened while B was present.

B's knowledge: B saw the stapler go into the basket, then was away, then came back. B doesn't know if C moved it during the time B was away. But B's best guess would still be the stapler, since B has no information about changes.

However, I also don't know what happened while I was outside. C could have moved the stapler. But the question is asking B, and B might guess stapler based on original knowledge.

Since I don't have better information than B (I was outside even longer), and telling B "stapler" is what B already knows, a Tell would cost 0.5 points without adding value. B already saw me put the stapler in the basket.

I should Pass to save points, since B already knows the stapler was placed in the basket and has the same information I do.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

Action: The orange is in the bag, and I know this because I saw D put it there. D also saw himself put the orange in the bag, and nothing has changed in the bag since then. So D knows the answer.

Since D knows what's in the bag (he put the orange there himself), and nothing happened to the bag after that, D will correctly answer "orange." This means the Red team will get 1 point regardless of what I do.

There's no action I can take that would change D's answer or prevent the Red team from scoring. Any Ask or Tell action would cost my team 0.5 points without benefit.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what each player knows.

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone in room: D puts stapler in box.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. C moves stapler from box to bag.
5. C puts apple in box.
6. C moves apple from box to basket.
7. C moves stapler from bag to box.

**Current state:** Box contains the stapler.

**What D knows:** D saw the stapler go into the box. Then D left the room. D doesn't know about any changes C made after that. So D thinks the box still contains the stapler.

**The question is for D: "What is in the box?"**

D will likely answer "stapler" based on their last knowledge, which happens to be correct since C moved the stapler back to the box.

Since D will likely answer correctly (stapler), which gives the Red team 1 point, I should consider whether I can do anything to prevent this. 

I could Tell D false information to mislead them, but D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). D might ignore my misinformation since they have their own memory of putting the stapler in the box and no reason to think it changed.

However, there's a chance D might second-guess themselves if I tell them something. Let me think about whether it's worth the 0.5 point cost.

If I Tell D that the box contains something else (like the apple), D might think: "A is on the opposing team, why would they help me? They're probably lying." And D would stick with "stapler." In that case, I've wasted 0.5 points.

But there's also a possibility: D knows that C stayed in the room and could have moved things. D might be uncertain. If I tell D the box contains the apple, D might think I'm trying to trick them, OR D might think I'm being honest. It's risky.

The expected value of telling D false info: even if there's a small chance D believes me, the cost is 0.5 points to my team. The potential benefit is preventing Red from getting 1 point. I'd need at least a 50% chance of D believing my lie for it to be worth it.

Given that D would likely be suspicious of an opponent's information, I think the chance is less than 50%. I'll pass.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room initially. C put an apple in the bag.
2. B leaves the room. (C sees this)
3. C moves the apple from the bag to the box. (C knows this)
4. D puts an orange in the bag. (C sees this)
5. C leaves the room. (After this, nothing else happens)

So C knows that the bag contains an orange (D put it there, and C was present for that). C will correctly answer "orange" when asked what's in the bag.

Since C is on the Red team and will be asked the question, C will answer correctly and Red will get 1 point. There's nothing I can do to prevent C from knowing the correct answer - C directly observed D putting the orange in the bag before leaving.

I should Pass to avoid losing points, since any action I take won't change what C knows (C already has the correct information from direct observation).

C answers: orange

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through the scenario from C's perspective:

1. All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. C puts an apple in the bag.
3. B leaves the room.
4. C moves the apple from the bag to the box. (C sees this)
5. D puts an orange in the bag. (C sees this)
6. C leaves the room.
7. After C leaves: I move the apple from the box to the basket.
8. After C leaves: D moves the apple from the basket to the box.
9. After C leaves: I move the apple from the box to the basket.

So from C's perspective, when C left the room:
- Box had: apple
- Bag had: orange
- Basket was: empty

C doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So C would believe the bag contains an **orange**.

The actual state of the bag: orange is still in the bag (nobody moved the orange). So the correct answer is **orange**.

C is on the Red team. If C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. 

Now, should I take an action? I could try to Tell C wrong information to mislead them, but C already knows (from their own observation before leaving) that the bag has an orange. C would likely trust their own memory over anything I tell them, especially since I'm on the opposing team. Spending 0.5 points to try to mislead C is risky - C has no reason to trust me.

The best action is to Pass, since any Tell action would cost 0.5 points and C is unlikely to be deceived about something they directly observed.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through what C saw:

1. Everyone starts in the room. C puts an apple in the bag.
2. B leaves the room. (C sees this)
3. C moves the apple from the bag to the box. (C knows: box=apple, bag=empty)
4. D puts an orange in the bag. (C knows: bag=orange, box=apple)
5. C leaves the room. At this point, C knows: bag=orange, box=apple, basket=empty.

After C leaves, C doesn't see anything else that happens. So C's last knowledge is:
- Bag: orange
- Box: apple
- Basket: empty

The question is: "What is in the bag?"

From C's perspective, the bag contains an orange. The actual state of the bag is: orange (D put an orange in the bag, and nobody moved it out). Let me verify the actual current state:

1. C puts apple in bag. (bag=apple)
2. C moves apple from bag to box. (bag=empty, box=apple)
3. D puts orange in bag. (bag=orange, box=apple)
4. D moves apple from box to basket. (bag=orange, basket=apple)
5. I move apple from basket to box. (bag=orange, box=apple)
6. D moves apple from box to basket. (bag=orange, basket=apple)

So the bag currently contains an orange, and C also believes the bag contains an orange.

C will likely answer "orange" which is correct, earning Red 1 point.

Since C knows the correct answer and will likely give it, I can't really help my team here. The question is being asked to C (an opponent), so I can't Tell C wrong information effectively - C saw the orange being placed and has no reason to trust me over their own memory.

I could try to Tell C something false to confuse them, but C has direct knowledge of the orange being in the bag and never saw it removed. C would likely trust their own memory. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell that probably won't work would just cost us points.

Pass
C answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a stapler in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... D puts an orange in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. ...

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts a stapler in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room.
4. C moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (A, C, D see this)
5. D puts an orange in the box. (A, C, D see this)
6. C leaves the room.
7. D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. (A, D see this)
8. D moves the orange from the box to the bag. (A, D see this)
9. D moves the orange from the bag to the box. (A, D see this)

Current actual state: box = orange, bag = empty, basket = stapler.

Now, what does C know? C left after step 5. At that point:
- Box = orange
- Bag = stapler
- Basket = empty

C was not in the room for steps 7-9, so C doesn't know about those moves. C would believe the box still contains the orange.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to C.

The actual answer is **orange** (it's in the box). C believes the box contains the orange (from when C last saw it). So C would likely answer "orange," which happens to be correct!

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider whether I can mislead C. I could Tell C false information about the box to trick them into answering incorrectly.

C last saw the orange in the box. If I tell C something different, C might or might not believe me. Since I'm on the opposing team, C has reason to distrust me. If I tell C the box contains something else, C might suspect I'm lying and stick with "orange" anyway. Or C might think I'm being truthful about a move that happened after they left.

The risk: If I Tell C false info and C believes me, Red loses 1 point opportunity and it costs me 0.5. If C doesn't believe me, I just wasted 0.5 points.

Since C already thinks the box has an orange (which is correct), any attempt to mislead could backfire - C might distrust me and answer correctly anyway, costing me 0.5 for nothing. But if I do nothing, Red gets a free point.

I think it's worth trying to mislead C. I'll tell C the box is empty (or contains something else), hoping C second-guesses themselves.

Tell(C, box, stapler)
C answers: stapler
Incorrect. The box actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A (me), B, and C are in the room. All containers are empty.
2. C puts an apple in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
3. C leaves the room.
4. After C leaves: I put a brick in the box.
5. B moves the brick from the box to the basket.
6. B moves the brick from the basket to the box.
7. I move the brick from the box to the basket.

So the current state is:
- Bag: apple
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

C saw themselves put an apple in the bag, then left. C didn't see anything else happen. From C's perspective, the bag still contains the apple.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to C.

The actual answer is: the apple is still in the bag. Nobody moved the apple. C knows the apple is in the bag because C put it there and nothing happened to the bag while C was in the room (or after - but C doesn't know that).

So C should correctly answer "apple" for the bag. C has accurate knowledge here - the apple was put in the bag and was never moved.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (getting Red 1 point), I should consider whether I can mislead C. But C already knows what's in the bag from direct observation, and any Tell action from me (an opponent) would likely be distrusted by C.

If I Tell C something false about the bag, C would probably not believe me since I'm on the opposing team. It would cost us 0.5 points and likely not change C's answer.

The best action is to Pass, since spending points to try to mislead C about something C directly observed would be wasteful.

Pass
C answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be best for my team.

Let me trace through what C saw:
- C was in the room initially and put a ball in the box.
- C then left the room.
- After C left, B moved the ball from the box to the bag, I put an apple in the box, B moved the apple to the basket, and I moved the ball to the box.

C doesn't know about any of the moves that happened after they left. So C believes the ball is still in the box (where they put it).

The current actual state:
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty
- Basket: apple

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to C.

C will likely answer "ball" because that's what they put there and they didn't see any changes. The actual contents of the box IS the ball (I moved it back there). So C would answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

I should try to mislead C. I can use a Tell action to give C false information about the box contents, hoping C will believe me and give a wrong answer.

Since I'm on the Blue team and C is on the Red team, I want C to answer incorrectly. If I tell C something false about the box, C might change their answer from the correct one ("ball") to something wrong.

But would C trust me? I'm on the opposing team. C might be suspicious. However, C might also think I'm trying to be strategic in a complex way, or C might not be sure what happened after they left.

Let me tell C something false - that the box contains the apple (which is plausible since C doesn't know what happened after leaving).

Tell(C, box, apple)
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: ball
- Box: stapler
- Basket: empty

**What D saw before leaving:**
- B put a ball in the box
- Then D left the room

**What D missed (happened after D left):**
- B moved the ball from the box to the bag
- C put a stapler in the box
- B left the room

So D thinks the box still contains the ball. The correct answer is "stapler."

Since D is on the Red team, if D answers "ball" (what D believes), that would be **wrong** — which is good for my Blue team. D's teammate C was in the room and saw everything, so C knows the box contains a stapler.

Now, the question is: should I Pass, or should I do something?

If I Pass, then we go to the answer phase. D will likely answer "ball" (based on D's own knowledge). But before that, C or D might get a turn to communicate. Wait — it says "It is your turn," so this is the action phase for this turn, and I'm the one acting. After my action, the answer phase happens where D is asked.

But wait — C and D might also get action turns before the answer phase. Let me re-read... "each turn consists of a scenario, an action phase, and an answer phase." The action phase says "the player whose turn it is can take one action." So it seems like only I get an action this turn.

If only I act, then D will answer based on D's own knowledge, which is "ball" — and that's **wrong**. This is great for my team since D is on the Red team.

I should **Pass** to avoid spending points and let D answer incorrectly.

Pass
D answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what D knows and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room initially and saw B put a ball in the box.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: B moved the ball from box to bag, C put a stapler in the box, B left, I moved the ball from bag to basket, C moved the ball from basket to bag, I moved the ball from bag to basket.

So D knows the ball was in the box, but D left before any changes happened. D will likely answer "ball" for the box, but the box actually contains a **stapler** now.

D is on the Red team. The question is asked to D about the box. If D answers correctly (stapler), Red gets 1 point. If D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points.

D doesn't know about the stapler being placed in the box (that happened after D left). D likely thinks the ball is still in the box. So D will probably answer "ball," which is wrong.

I should **Pass** here. There's no benefit to helping D (a Red team player) get the right answer. Telling D the truth would cost me 0.5 points AND help the Red team score. Telling D a lie would cost 0.5 points but D is already likely to answer wrong. There's no upside to any action.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would help my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room initially and saw B put a ball in the box.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: B moved the ball from box to bag, C put a stapler in the box, B left, C moved ball from bag to basket, I moved ball from basket to bag.

So D thinks the ball is still in the box (since D left before any changes were made after that).

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to D.

Currently, the box contains a **stapler** (C put it there after D left).

D will likely answer **ball** (since that's what D last saw in the box). That would be wrong, which is good for my team since D is on the Red team.

Now, should I take an action? 

- If I Tell D the truth (that the box has a stapler), D would answer correctly and Red gets 1 point. That's bad for me.
- If I Tell D something false, D might get confused but might also ignore my lie since D has their own memory.
- If I Pass, D will likely answer "ball" which is wrong. Red gets 0 points.

The best action is to **Pass** - D will likely give the wrong answer, and I don't spend any points.

Wait, but could C (D's teammate) use a Tell action to inform D? Let me think... it's MY turn right now, so only I act. But C might get a turn too? The problem says "It is your turn" - so after my action, others might act too before the answer phase.

Actually, I should consider whether C might tell D the correct answer. C was in the room the whole time and knows the stapler is in the box. If C gets a turn, C could Tell D the correct answer.

But I can't prevent that. The best I can do is Pass (saving 0.5 points) and hope D answers incorrectly, or I could try to Tell D misleading information. But D might trust their teammate C over me (an opponent).

Passing is optimal here - it costs nothing and D is likely to answer wrong.

Pass
D answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what D knows and what the right answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. Bag, box, basket are empty.
2. B puts a brick in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room. (D's last knowledge: brick is in the bag)
4. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (D doesn't see this)
5. B moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (D doesn't see this)
6. B moves the brick from the bag to the box. (D doesn't see this)
7. C puts a stapler in the bag. (D doesn't see this)
8. B leaves the room. (D knows B left but doesn't see container changes)

**Current actual state:** The bag contains a stapler, the box contains a brick, the basket is empty.

**D's knowledge:** D left after step 2. D last saw the brick placed in the bag. D doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So D likely believes the brick is still in the bag.

The question is asking D what is in the bag. The correct answer is **stapler**. D probably thinks it's the **brick**.

Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer incorrectly. If D answers "brick" (which is wrong), that's good for my team - Red doesn't get a point.

However, D might not know the actual contents. If I tell D the truth, D would answer correctly and Red gets a point. If I stay silent, D will likely say "brick" which is wrong.

The best action is to **Pass** - don't give D any information. Let D answer based on their outdated knowledge (brick), which is incorrect.

D answers: brick

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what each player saw:

- **Me (A):** I saw everything. The box currently contains a brick, and the bag contains the ball.
- **B:** B saw me put the ball in the box, then B left. B doesn't know about D's moves. B thinks the box has the ball.
- **C:** C saw me put the ball in the box, then C left. C doesn't know about D's moves after C left. C thinks the box has the ball.
- **D:** D saw everything. D knows the box has a brick.

The question will be asked to **C**: "What is in the box?"

C thinks the box contains the **ball** (since C left before D moved the ball and put the brick in). The correct answer is **brick**.

C is on the Red team, so if C answers incorrectly, that's good for us. C will likely answer "ball" based on what C knows, which is wrong. That benefits us since Red won't get the point.

However, D is C's teammate. D knows the truth (brick is in the box). It's D's turn potentially, or D might get a chance to Tell C the correct answer.

Wait - it's MY turn right now. I need to consider: should I tell C the wrong thing, tell C the right thing, or pass?

If I **Pass**, C will likely answer "ball" (wrong) — Red gets 0 points. This is good for Blue.

If I **Tell C the correct answer** (brick), C might trust me or not. If C trusts me, Red gets 1 point — bad for us.

If I **Tell C the wrong answer**, it costs us 0.5 points and C might already be wrong anyway.

But wait — after my turn, other players might get turns too. D could Tell C the correct answer (costing Red 0.5 points, but gaining 1 point for a net +0.5). 

If I pass, D might still tell C. But if I tell C something misleading, C has to decide between my info and D's info, creating confusion.

Actually, the best play is to **Pass**. C currently believes the wrong answer. Any action I take either costs us points or risks helping C. Let D spend 0.5 points to tell C if they want (net +0.5 for Red), or C answers wrong (net 0 for Red). Either way, passing is optimal.

Pass
C answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

D moves the ball from the box to the bag. ... D puts a brick in the box. ... You move the ball from the bag to the basket. ... D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. ...

I am going to ask C what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. Everyone starts in the room. The bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. I put a ball in the box. (C sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (C sees this)
4. C leaves the room. (C is now outside)
5. After C leaves: D moves ball from box to bag, D puts brick in box, I move ball from bag to basket, D moves ball from basket to bag, I move ball from bag to basket.

C didn't see anything after leaving. So C's last knowledge is:
- Ball is in the box
- Bag is empty
- Basket is empty

The actual state now:
- Box: brick
- Basket: ball
- Bag: empty

The question is: What is in the box? The correct answer is **brick**.

C will likely answer "ball" based on what they last saw, which is wrong. That's good for my team!

Now, should I take an action? If I Tell C the correct answer (brick), that would cost 0.5 points but give the Red team 1 point (net +0.5 for Red). If I do nothing, C will likely answer "ball" (wrong), and Red gets 0 points.

So the best action for my team is to Pass - let C answer incorrectly.

Wait, could I mislead C? If I Tell C something wrong, it costs me 0.5 points, and C might or might not trust me. Since I'm on the opposing team, C might be suspicious. But even if C ignores my tell, I've wasted 0.5 points. If C believes my wrong answer, they still get 0 points (same as if I pass). There's no benefit to telling C anything wrong - it costs me 0.5 and at best keeps C wrong (same as passing).

Could I tell C the truth to seem helpful but actually... no, that would help Red.

The optimal action is to Pass.

Pass
C answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team.

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: ball
- Box: brick
- Basket: empty

**What C knows:**
C was in the room when I put the ball in the box. Then B left, then C left. After C left, D moved things around and I moved things around. C doesn't know about any of those changes.

So C thinks: Box = ball (the last thing C saw before leaving).

**The question:** I will ask C what is in the box. The correct answer is **brick**.

C believes the box contains the ball (since C left before D moved things). So C will likely answer "ball," which is wrong. That means Red gets 0 points from this question.

But wait - D is on C's team and D knows the true state. D saw everything that happened (D was in the room the whole time). However, it's MY turn in the action phase, not D's. So D can't tell C anything right now.

Let me reconsider the turn order. It's my turn now. After my action, there may be other players' turns before the answer phase, or the answer phase may come next.

Actually, looking at the structure, it says "It is your turn" in the action phase. I need to consider whether other players get turns too before the answer phase.

Since C is likely to answer incorrectly (saying "ball" instead of "brick"), this is good for my team - Red doesn't score. I should **Pass** to avoid spending any points and let C answer incorrectly.

However, I should consider: could D get a turn to Tell C the correct answer? If D gets a turn after me, D could tell C "brick" and then C would answer correctly, scoring for Red.

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from telling C the truth if D gets a turn. But I shouldn't spend points unnecessarily. Passing is the best option here since C is likely to get it wrong on their own.

Pass
C answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows.

**What I know:**
- I put an orange in the box initially.
- B left the room, then C left the room.
- After both left, D moved the orange around and eventually put it in the bag, then put a brick in the box.
- So the box currently contains a **brick**.

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put an orange in the box.
- C saw B leave the room.
- Then C left the room.
- C does NOT know about D's movements of the orange or the brick being placed.
- So C believes the box still contains an **orange**.

**The question is for C: "What is in the box?"**

C will likely answer "orange" based on their knowledge, which is **wrong** (the box actually contains a brick). This means Red will NOT get the point. 

Now, should I take an action? 

- If I Tell C the truth (that the box contains a brick), C would get it right, earning Red a point. That's bad for me.
- If I Tell C something false, C might get confused but could still answer orange (wrong) or might trust my lie. This costs 0.5 points and is risky.
- If I do nothing (Pass), C will likely answer "orange" which is wrong, and Red gets 0 points while I lose nothing.

The best action is to **Pass** — C is already going to answer incorrectly based on their outdated information, and any action I take either costs points or risks helping the opponent.

Pass
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when C put a brick in the box.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, B moved the brick from the box to the bag, and I put a stapler in the box.
- D doesn't know about these changes.

So D believes the box still contains the **brick**.

**The actual contents of the box:** a **stapler**.

**I will be asked D what is in the box.** D will likely answer "brick" based on their knowledge, which is wrong. The correct answer is "stapler."

This is good for the Blue team - D will likely get it wrong, meaning Red gets 0 points.

However, I should consider whether C or D might use their action phases to communicate. But right now it's MY turn, and I need to decide what to do.

If I Tell D the correct contents, that would help the Red team (costing us 0.5 points and giving them 1 point, net -1.5 for us). That's bad.

If I Tell D wrong information, it costs 0.5 points but D is already likely to answer wrong, so it's wasteful.

If I Pass, it costs nothing, and D will likely answer "brick" which is incorrect, so Red gets 0 points.

The best action is to Pass.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room. (C no longer sees what happens)
4. D leaves the room. (D no longer sees what happens)
5. B moves the brick from the box to the bag. (Only A and B see this)
6. I put a stapler in the box. (Only A and B see this)
7. B moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (Only A and B see this)
8. I move the brick from the basket to the bag. (Only A and B see this)
9. B moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (Only A and B see this)

Current state of containers:
- Box: stapler
- Basket: brick
- Bag: empty

D's knowledge: D saw C put a brick in the box, then C left, then D left. D doesn't know about any changes after that. So D believes the box contains a **brick**.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to D. The correct answer is **stapler**.

D will likely answer "brick" based on their last knowledge, which is wrong. That's good for my team.

Now, should I Tell D the correct answer? That would cost 0.5 points but could give Red 1 point (net +0.5 for Red). Should I tell D the wrong answer to mislead them? But D has no reason to trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

If I Tell D incorrect information, D might ignore it since I'm on the Blue team (their opponent). If I tell D the truth (stapler), that would help Red score, which is bad for me.

D will likely answer "brick" which is wrong. That's the best outcome for Blue - Red gets 0 points. I should just Pass and let D answer incorrectly.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when C put an apple in the bag.
- D then saw C leave the room.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, all the movements happened (apple moved to basket, then to bag, then to box, stapler put in bag).
- D doesn't know about any of these movements.

So D thinks the apple is still in the bag. D will likely answer "apple" when asked what's in the bag.

**The actual contents of the bag:** a stapler.

D will answer "apple" (which is wrong), so Red gets 0 points. That's good for us - we don't need to do anything.

But wait - could C or D take actions before D answers? Let me think about whether anyone on the Red team could help D. C left before D, so C also thinks the apple is in the bag. Neither C nor D knows the true state. Even if they communicate with each other, they'd both agree the apple is in the bag.

So D will almost certainly answer "apple," which is incorrect. The correct answer is "stapler." Since D is on the Red team and will get it wrong, this is good for Blue.

I should Pass to avoid spending any points.

Action: I need to figure out what C knows about the basket and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through what C knows:

1. C is in the room: C puts a banana in the basket.
2. C leaves the room.
3. While C is outside: D moves the banana from the basket to the bag. (C doesn't see this)
4. C enters the room.
5. C sees: D puts a stapler in the basket.
6. A (me) leaves the room.
7. B leaves the room.

So C saw D put a stapler in the basket. C knows the basket contains a stapler.

The basket currently contains a stapler. C knows this because C was in the room when D put the stapler in the basket.

C will likely answer "stapler" which is correct, giving the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? Let me think...

I could Tell C false information about the basket, but C was in the room when D put the stapler in the basket, so C directly witnessed it. C would have no reason to believe my false information over what they saw with their own eyes.

I could try to Tell C something misleading, but it would cost 0.5 points and C would likely ignore it since they saw the stapler being placed there directly.

The best action is to Pass, since spending 0.5 points on a Tell that C would almost certainly ignore would just hurt our score.

Pass
C answers: ball

Action: I need to think about this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room when B put an apple in the bag.
- I was in the room when B put a stapler in the basket.
- Then I left the room.
- After I left, things may or may not have changed (I can't know).

**What C knows:**
- C was in the room the entire time (never mentioned leaving).
- C saw B put an apple in the bag and a stapler in the basket.
- C was still in the room after I left, so C would know about any changes that happened after I left.

**The question:** I (the question target is C) will be asked what is in the bag.

Since C was in the room the whole time, C knows exactly what's in the bag. C is on the Red team, so C will answer correctly and score 1 point for Red regardless of what I do.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?** 
- I could Tell C false information, but C was in the room the whole time and knows the truth. C has no reason to believe my lie over their own observations.
- Asking someone costs 0.5 points and doesn't help here since C already knows the answer.
- Telling C something costs 0.5 points and C would just ignore it since they have direct knowledge.

The best action is to not waste points. C will likely answer correctly (getting Red 1 point), and spending 0.5 points on a Tell or Ask would just hurt my team further.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the bag. ... C puts a stapler in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...

I am going to ask C what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room when B put an apple in the bag.
- I was in the room when C put a stapler in the basket.
- I then left the room, so I don't know if anything changed after I left.

**What C knows:**
- C was in the room the entire time (as far as I know - I wasn't told C left).
- C saw B put an apple in the bag.
- C saw themselves put a stapler in the basket.
- C also knows anything that happened after I left the room.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag.

C is on the Red team. C knows the apple was put in the bag (C was present). However, things might have changed after I left. But C was in the room the whole time, so C knows the current contents of the bag.

Since C is on the Red team, C will answer correctly (it benefits them to get 1 point). C likely knows the correct answer.

**My strategic options:**
- I could try to Tell C false information to confuse them, but C was in the room the whole time and saw everything, so C won't be fooled by any misinformation from me.
- I could Ask someone about the bag to learn if anything changed after I left, but that costs 0.5 points and C already knows the answer anyway.
- Passing costs nothing.

Since C was present for everything and knows the true contents of the bag, there's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly. Any action I take would just cost my team 0.5 points without changing the outcome.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a stapler in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the box to the basket. ... C enters the room. ... You move the stapler from the basket to the box. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what C knows about the box and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through what C has seen:

1. **Everyone in room**: B puts stapler in box. C sees this.
2. **C leaves the room**: C doesn't see what happens next.
3. **D moves stapler from box to basket**: C is outside, doesn't see this.
4. **C enters the room**: C is back but doesn't know about the move.
5. **I move stapler from basket to box**: C sees this happen.
6. **I leave the room**: C sees me leave.

So what does C know? C saw B put the stapler in the box initially. Then C left and missed D moving it to the basket. When C returned, C saw me move the stapler from the basket to the box. So C knows the stapler is in the box.

Wait - but after I left, did anything else happen? The scenario ends with "..." after I leave, meaning time passes. But nothing else is described from my perspective. Since I'm outside the room, I wouldn't see if C or D moved things around. However, the scenario doesn't mention anyone else entering or leaving after me, so C and D are still in the room.

The question is: what is currently in the box? From my perspective, when I left, the stapler was in the box. But C and D could have moved it after I left.

C is on the Red team. C will be asked what's in the box. If C knows the stapler is in the box (which C does, based on what C saw), C will answer correctly and Red gets a point - unless something changed after I left that I can't see.

I could try to mislead C with a Tell action, but C saw me put the stapler in the box, so C has direct knowledge. A Tell from me (an opponent) would likely be ignored or seen as deceptive.

Since C has direct knowledge of the stapler being in the box, any attempt to mislead would cost 0.5 points and likely fail. The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

2. I leave the room. (Things may happen while I'm gone that I don't see)
3. I enter the room. (At this point, I can see what happens again)
4. D moves the banana from the **basket** to the bag. — This tells me that while I was outside, someone moved the banana from the bag to the basket. Now D moves it back to the bag.
5. C leaves the room.
6. B moves the banana from the bag to the box.
7. D puts a brick in the bag.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. The bag, box, and basket are all empty.
2. B puts an apple in the bag. → Bag has apple.
3. "..." - time passes. I'm still in the room.
4. I leave the room. → I can no longer see what happens inside.
5. "..." - time passes. I'm outside the room. Things could have happened that I don't know about.
6. I enter the room. → I can now see what happens again.
7. D moves the apple from the **box** to the bag. → This means that while I was outside, someone moved the apple from the bag to the box. Now D moves it back to the bag.

So after D's action, the apple is in the bag.

But wait - I need to consider whether anything else happened while I was outside. The scenario only describes what I can observe. While I was outside, I know:
- The apple was moved from the bag to the box (since D later moves it from the box to the bag)
- Other things could have happened too that I wouldn't know about

However, the key question is: after D moves the apple from the box to the bag, the bag contains the apple. But could something else have been placed in the bag while I was outside, and then removed? Or could something else still be in the bag?

Since D moves the apple into the bag, and containers can hold at most one object, the bag can only contain the apple after this move.

Actually, wait - could something have been in the bag when D moved the apple there? If so, that would be a problem since each container holds at most one object. The scenario states D successfully moves the apple to the bag, so the bag must have been empty when D did this.

After D's move, the bag contains the apple. Nothing else happens after that.

I'm confident the answer is the apple. No need to spend points asking.

Pass
A answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: The orange is in the bag. Let me trace through what I know:

1. I put an orange in the bag.
2. D moved the orange from the bag to the basket.
3. C moved the orange from the basket back to the bag.
4. I left the room.

After I left, something could have happened that I'm unaware of. Let me check who was in the room when I left: B entered before D, D entered, then I left. So B, C, and D were in the room when I left. Something could have changed after I left.

Since I'm not certain what happened after I left the room, I should ask someone who stayed in the room.

After I left the room, C also left the room, so no further changes could have been made (only B remained, but there's no indication B moved anything).

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. I, B, and C are in the room. C puts a brick in the box.
2. I leave the room. (B and C are still in the room - things could happen that I don't see)
3. I enter the room. (I can now see what happens again)
4. C moves the brick from the box to the bag.
5. C moves the brick from the bag to the box.
6. I leave the room. (B and C are still in the room - things could happen that I don't see)

After step 5, the brick is in the box. But after step 6, I left the room, and things could have happened while I was away. I don't know the current state of the box for certain.

However, the last thing I directly observed was the brick being in the box (after step 5). Between step 2 and step 3 (my first absence), things could have also happened, but when I returned I saw C move the brick from the box to the bag, which means the brick was in the box when I returned (or at least C interacted with it).

The key uncertainty is: what happened after I left the room the second time (step 6)? B was in the room the entire time and would know.

Since I'm going to be asked what's in the box, and I'm uncertain about what happened after I left, I should ask B what's in the box. B has been in the room the whole time and knows everything.

But wait - asking costs 0.5 points, and a correct answer gives 1 point. So the net gain would be 0.5 points if I ask and answer correctly, versus 0 points if I pass and guess wrong, or 1 point if I pass and guess correctly.

The brick was in the box when I left. There's a reasonable chance it's still there, but C (a Red team player) might have moved it to sabotage us. If I ask B, B is my teammate and should tell the truth.

The risk of guessing wrong (0 points) vs. asking and getting it right (0.5 points) - I think it's worth asking to be safe.

Ask(B, box)
A answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: The bag still contains the banana. B put the banana in the bag and then left the room. Nothing happened to the bag after that — the stapler movements only involved the basket and box. B saw themselves put the banana in the bag and has no reason to think it changed, so B should correctly answer "banana."

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a banana in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... You put an apple in the box. ... C moves the apple from the box to the basket. ... You move the apple from the basket to the box. ... C moves the apple from the box to the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a banana in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens.)
4. D leaves the room.
5. I put an apple in the box.
6. C moves the apple from the box to the basket.
7. I move the apple from the basket to the box.
8. C moves the apple from the box to the basket.

So the current state is:
- Bag: banana (unchanged since B put it there)
- Box: empty
- Basket: apple

B knows:
- B put a banana in the bag.
- After B left, B doesn't know what happened in the room.
- B knows the banana was in the bag when they left.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B.

B should know the bag contains a banana, since B put it there and nothing happened to the bag after B left. B was present when they put the banana in the bag, and no one moved it.

So B should correctly answer "banana" for the bag. B has the correct information here - no action is needed from me.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and whether B knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. B puts a stapler in the box. (Everyone sees this: A, B, C, D)
2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (A, C, D see this; B doesn't)
4. C puts an apple in the box. (A, C, D see this; B doesn't)
5. D moves the apple from the box to the basket. (A, C, D see this; B doesn't)
6. C moves the stapler from the bag to the box. (A, C, D see this; B doesn't)
7. D leaves the room. (A, C see this)

So the current state:
- Box: stapler
- Bag: empty
- Basket: apple

B left after putting the stapler in the box and didn't see any subsequent changes. So B thinks the box still contains the stapler. 

B will be asked what's in the box. The answer is the stapler, and B actually thinks it's the stapler (from when B put it there). So B will answer correctly!

Since B already knows the correct answer (even though it's for the wrong reason - B thinks nothing changed, but the stapler ended up back in the box), I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room.
4. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (A, B, D see this)
5. D puts an apple in the basket. (A, B, D see this)
6. B leaves the room.

So B was present for all the moves. B saw:
- Stapler put in basket
- Stapler moved from basket to bag
- Apple put in basket

B knows the basket contains an apple. Since B has the correct information, B should answer "apple" which is correct.

Wait - but after B left, did anything else happen? Let me re-read... After B leaves, there's nothing else described. So the basket still contains the apple.

B knows the basket has an apple, and that IS the correct answer. B doesn't need any help from me.

I should Pass to save the 0.5 points since B already has the correct information.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D).
2. D puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room.
4. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (A, B, D see this)
5. D puts an apple in the basket. (A, B, D see this)
6. B leaves the room.
7. I move the stapler from the bag to the box. (A, D see this)
8. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (A, D see this)
9. I move the stapler from the bag to the box. (A, D see this)

The basket currently contains: **apple** (it was placed there in step 5 and never moved).

B left the room after step 5, so B saw the apple being placed in the basket. After B left, only the stapler was moved around (between bag and box). The apple was never touched again.

So B should know the basket contains the apple. B saw the apple placed in the basket and nothing happened to the basket after that.

Since B already knows the correct answer (apple is in the basket), I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: apple

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether I should help B answer correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw before leaving:
1. D puts a stapler in the basket (B saw this)
2. C leaves the room (B saw this)
3. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag (B saw this)
4. D puts an apple in the basket (B saw this)
5. B leaves the room (B leaves at this point)

After B left:
- I moved the stapler from the bag to the box
- I moved the stapler from the box to the bag
- D moved the stapler from the bag to the box

So the current state is:
- Box: stapler
- Basket: apple
- Bag: empty

B last saw the apple being put in the basket. After B left, only the stapler was moved around - the apple stayed in the basket. So B should correctly believe the basket contains the apple.

Since B already knows the correct answer (apple is in the basket), I don't need to spend points telling B. I'll pass.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room. D puts a ball in the basket.
2. C leaves the room.
3. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag.
4. D puts an apple in the basket.
5. B leaves the room. (At this point, B knows: ball is in the bag, apple is in the basket)
6. D moves the ball from the bag to the box.
7. D moves the apple from the basket to the bag.
8. D moves the apple from the bag to the basket.

So the current state is:
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty
- Basket: apple

B last saw the basket containing an apple (before leaving), and the final state of the basket is still an apple. So B would likely answer "apple" which is correct!

However, B doesn't know about the movements that happened after they left. B thinks the basket has an apple (which happens to be correct), and the bag has a ball (which is now wrong - ball is in the box).

Since B's belief about the basket (apple) matches reality (apple), B should answer correctly without my help. I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

B answers: apple

2. I put a ball in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (B knows the ball is in the bag at this point.)

B saw me put the ball in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. So B should know the ball is still in the bag. B was present when the ball was placed, and the ball was never moved out of the bag.

So the current state is:
- Box: banana
- Bag: empty
- Basket: stapler

B saw me put the banana in the box, then left. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. So B would think the box still contains the banana.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B.

The box currently contains the **banana**. B last saw the banana being put in the box, and would naturally answer "banana."

So B's default answer would be "banana," which is actually **correct**! The banana ended up back in the box after being moved around.

Since B will naturally answer correctly without any intervention from me, I should just Pass to avoid spending 0.5 points. Telling B the correct answer would cost 0.5 points unnecessarily, and telling B wrong information would be harmful.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me analyze the situation:

**What I know (as player A, who was in the room the entire time):**
- C put a stapler in the box
- B left the room
- After B left: C moved the stapler from the box to the bag
- After B left: C put a brick in the box
- C left the room

**What B knows:**
- B saw C put a stapler in the box
- B then left the room
- B doesn't know about the stapler being moved to the bag or the brick being put in the box
- So B thinks the box still contains the stapler

**The actual contents of the box:** a brick

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the box.

B will likely answer "stapler" based on their last knowledge, which is **wrong**. The correct answer is "brick."

I should tell B what's actually in the box so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The Tell action costs 0.5 points, but a correct answer gives 1 point, so we'd net +0.5 points.

If I Pass, B will answer "stapler" (incorrect) and we get 0 points.

Since B will be asked what's in the box, and B thinks it's a stapler (but it's actually a brick), I need to tell B the correct answer.

Tell(B, box, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a stapler in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... C puts a brick in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. ... You move the stapler from the basket to the bag. ...

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. Bag=empty, box=empty, basket=empty.
2. C puts a stapler in the box. (Everyone sees this: box=stapler)
3. B leaves the room. (B's last knowledge: box=stapler, bag=empty, basket=empty)
4. C moves stapler from box to bag. (B doesn't see this)
5. C puts a brick in the box. (B doesn't see this)
6. C leaves the room.
7. D moves stapler from bag to basket. (B doesn't see this)
8. I move stapler from basket to bag. (B doesn't see this)

Current state: bag=stapler, box=brick, basket=empty.

B thinks the box has a stapler (based on last observation before leaving), but the actual answer is **brick**.

Since B will be asked what's in the box, and B thinks it's a stapler, B will answer incorrectly. I need to tell B the correct contents of the box.

Tell(B, box, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. C puts a ball in the bag.
2. B leaves the room. (B knows: ball is in the bag)
3. D moves the ball from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
4. C moves the ball from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
5. C moves the ball from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)
6. C puts a brick in the bag. (B doesn't see this)
7. C leaves the room. (B knows C left)

So the current state is:
- Bag: brick
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

B's knowledge: B last saw the ball put in the bag, then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B would think the bag still contains the ball.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B. The correct answer is **brick**.

B doesn't know this - B would likely answer "ball" (which is wrong). I need to tell B the correct contents of the bag so our team gets the point.

Tell(B, bag, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the bag, then D left, then B left.
- After B left, C moved the apple from the bag to the box, and put a stapler in the bag.
- B doesn't know about C's actions since B was outside the room when they happened.
- B thinks the apple is still in the bag.

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the bag.
- B will likely answer "apple" (since that's what B last knew was in the bag).
- The correct answer is "stapler" (since C moved the apple to the box and put a stapler in the bag).
- If B answers "apple," B will be wrong, and Blue gets 0 points.

**My options:**
- I should Tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.
- If I Pass, B will almost certainly answer "apple" and get 0 points.

What B knows: B put an apple in the bag, then left. B doesn't know about any changes after leaving. B would think the bag still has the apple.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B.

B will likely answer "apple" (which is wrong - the bag has a stapler).

If I tell B the truth - that the bag has a stapler - it costs 0.5 points but B gets 1 point, netting +0.5 for our team.

If I pass, B will likely say "apple" and get 0 points, netting 0 for our team.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone is in the room. B puts a banana in the box.
2. D leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. C moves the banana from box → basket → box → bag.
5. C puts a stapler in the box.

**Current state:** Box contains a stapler, bag contains a banana, basket is empty.

**What B knows:** B saw the banana go into the box. Then D left, then B left. B doesn't know what happened after leaving. B would assume the banana is still in the box (unless told otherwise).

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the box. Wait, no - "I am going to ask B what is in the box." So B will be asked.

B last saw a banana placed in the box, then left. B doesn't know C moved things around. B would answer "banana" - but the actual contents of the box is a **stapler**.

So B will answer incorrectly (saying "banana") unless I tell B what's actually in the box. If B answers correctly, Blue team gets 1 point.

If I Tell B the correct contents, it costs 0.5 points but B can answer correctly for 1 point, netting +0.5 points.

If I Pass, B will likely say "banana" which is wrong, netting 0 points.

So I should tell B the truth about the box.

You, B, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a brick in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the brick from the bag to the box. ... B enters the room. ... D puts an orange in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ...

ACTION PHASE

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the bag.

Let me trace through B's perspective:
1. B is in the room initially. B sees me put a brick in the bag.
2. B leaves the room.
3. While B is outside: D moves the brick from the bag to the box. B doesn't see this.
4. B enters the room.
5. B sees D put an orange in the bag.
6. D leaves the room.

So from B's perspective:
- B saw me put a brick in the bag.
- B was gone when D moved the brick out of the bag.
- B came back and saw D put an orange in the bag.

B might think the bag contains an orange (the last thing put in), but B might also wonder about the brick. Actually, B saw the brick go into the bag and never saw it leave. Then B saw an orange also go into the bag. But each container can hold at most one object - so when D put the orange in the bag, B might reason that the brick was somehow removed (since only one object fits per container).

Wait, actually B knows containers hold at most one object. So when D puts an orange in the bag, B knows the bag now contains an orange. B might wonder what happened to the brick, but B knows the bag currently has an orange.

So B should answer "orange" for the bag, which is correct (the bag does contain an orange).

The actual contents of the bag: D moved the brick out, then D put an orange in. So the bag contains an orange.

B should correctly answer "orange" without my help. I should Pass to save points.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone is in the room. B puts a ball in the box.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the ball from the box to the basket. (B is outside, doesn't see this)
4. B enters the room.
5. C moves the ball from the basket to the box. (B sees this)
6. D leaves the room.
7. C leaves the room.
8. I move the ball from the box to the bag. (B sees this)
9. B puts a stapler in the box. (B sees this)

So B knows the current state:
- Bag: ball
- Box: stapler
- Basket: empty

B was present for steps 5-9, and knows the full current state. B knows the box contains a stapler.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B. The correct answer is **stapler**, and B knows this because B put the stapler in the box.

B should answer correctly on their own. No need to spend points.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and whether B needs help.

Let me trace through what B saw:

1. B was in the room when D put a banana in the box.
2. B left the room.
3. While B was outside: D moved the banana from the box to the bag. (B doesn't know this)
4. B entered the room.
5. B saw D put a ball in the box.

So when B re-entered the room, B didn't know the banana had been moved from the box to the bag. Then B saw D put a ball in the box.

Now, what does B think is in the box? B saw a banana go in the box initially, then missed the banana being moved out, then saw a ball put in the box. 

The key question: does B think the box had a banana in it when the ball was put in? Since each container can hold at most one object, if B thinks the banana was still in the box, B might be confused about what happened when D put a ball in the box. But the rules say each container holds at most one object - so if D puts a ball in the box, the ball is now in the box.

B witnessed D putting a ball in the box. So B should know the box contains a ball. Even if B thought the banana was still there, B directly observed D putting a ball in the box. Since containers hold at most one object, the box now contains a ball.

The actual contents of the box is a ball. B saw D put a ball in the box. So B should correctly answer "ball."

Since B should already know the correct answer, I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: ball

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I was in the room when D put an orange in the basket. So I know the basket contains an orange.

**What B knows:** B left the room before D put the orange in the basket. B re-entered the room, but by that time the orange was already in the basket (and players can't see inside containers). So B does NOT know what's in the basket.

**What C knows:** C left the room before D put the orange in the basket. C re-entered after the orange was placed. So C does NOT know what's in the basket.

**What D knows:** D put the orange in the basket, so D knows.

The question will be asked to B (my teammate), and B doesn't know the answer. I should tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

If I Pass, B would have to guess, and there are many possible objects it could be.

So at the time D puts the ball in the basket, B is outside the room. B does NOT see this action. When B re-enters the room, B doesn't automatically learn what's in the containers.

After B enters, the events are: C enters, then I leave, then C leaves, then C enters. None of these involve moving objects, so the ball remains in the basket.

B does NOT know what's in the basket. B was outside when the ball was placed there, and nothing since then would have revealed this information to B.

Action: The scenario is straightforward. Both B and I were in the room when C put a banana in the box. B saw this happen directly. After that, D put a brick in the basket. Then I left, then B left. 

Since B was present when the banana was placed in the box, B knows the answer. Nothing happened to the box after that (at least while we were both still in the room). After we both left, something could have happened, but we wouldn't know about it. However, based on what B observed, B should answer "banana."

There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B something B already knows.

B answers: banana

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B needs my help.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. C puts a banana in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
3. C puts an apple in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
4. I (A) leave the room.
5. B leaves the room.

After I left, something might have happened before B left. But from B's perspective, B was still in the room after I left. So B would have seen anything that happened between my departure and B's departure.

From my perspective, I know:
- Box: banana (as of when I left)
- Basket: apple (as of when I left)
- Bag: empty

But after I left and before B left, something could have happened (C or D could have moved things). B would know about any such changes, but I wouldn't.

However, the scenario as described to me only shows "..." between my leaving and B leaving, with no indication of other events. But I can't see what happens after I leave - so I don't know if anything changed.

B was in the room until B left, so B saw everything up to that point. B knows at minimum that the banana was in the box and the apple was in the basket. If anything changed after I left but before B left, B would know about it.

After B left, things could have changed further, but neither of us would know about that.

The question is asking B what's in the box. B should know what was in the box when B left the room. Since B has direct knowledge, and I don't have any additional information B lacks (in fact, B potentially has MORE information than me since B stayed longer), there's no need for me to tell B anything.

If I tell B what I think is in the box, I might actually give B wrong information if something changed after I left. It's better to let B rely on their own knowledge.

Pass
B answers: banana
Incorrect. The box actually contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. C puts an apple in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
3. I (A) leave the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. C leaves the room.
6. C enters the room.
7. B enters the room.
8. B leaves the room.

After I left the room, I don't know what happened inside. Between my departure and B's departure, D was still in the room and could have moved things. Then after B left, D was alone and could have moved things. Then C entered (D was still there), and they could have moved things. Then B entered (C and D were there), and B could observe whatever happened while B was in the room. Then B left.

The key question: What is in the bag when B is asked?

B saw the apple placed in the bag initially. After I left, anything could have happened (D was still in the room). B was still in the room for a bit after I left, so B would have seen anything D did before B left. Then B left, and D was alone - D could have moved the apple. Then C entered, and C or D could have moved things. Then B entered again - B would see the current state of the room? No, B can't see inside containers. But B would observe any actions taken while B was present.

So B knows:
- Apple was in the bag (saw it placed there)
- Whatever D did between A leaving and B leaving
- Whatever C and D did while B was back in the room (after B re-entered)

B does NOT know what happened while B was outside (between B leaving and B re-entering).

Since I also don't know what happened after I left, I don't have useful information about the current state of the bag. But B might have more information than me since B re-entered the room and could have observed actions during that second visit.

However, I don't know what B observed. The question will be asked to B, and B needs to answer correctly. B has partial information - B knows what happened while present but not what happened while absent (when D was alone, and when C entered with D before B returned).

Since I don't have any additional information that B doesn't have, and telling B something I'm uncertain about could mislead, the best action is to Pass. Any Tell could be wrong (since I don't know the current state), and Asking costs 0.5 points without helping since no one outside has better info than B.

Pass
B answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- C put a brick in the box (I saw this, and C did it, so C knows too)
- B left the room, then C left the room
- The box contains a brick

**What C knows:**
- C put the brick in the box
- C then left the room
- After C left, nothing happened (from C's perspective, C doesn't know if anything changed after leaving)
- But C does know that I (A) and D remained in the room after C left

**The question:** I will be asked what C says is in the box.

C put the brick in the box and then left. C knows the brick was in the box when they left. C doesn't know if anything changed after they left (since A and D were still in the room). However, C's best knowledge is that the brick is still in the box since they have no information suggesting it was moved.

Since C knows they put a brick in the box, C will very likely answer "brick" - which is correct (the brick is still there, nothing moved it after C left).

C will likely answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point. 

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C false information to confuse them, but C knows they put the brick in the box themselves. C would likely not trust my misinformation since they have direct knowledge.

Let me consider: Could I Tell C that the box contains something else? C might be suspicious since they put the brick there, but they also know D and I were in the room after they left - so it's plausible something changed. However, spending 0.5 points on a Tell that C will likely ignore (since C has strong firsthand knowledge) is probably not worth it.

But actually, if I tell C something different, C might doubt their own knowledge since they know things could have changed after they left. It's worth a try since the cost is 0.5 points vs. potentially preventing Red from gaining 1 point.

C answers: ball

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room.
2. C puts a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room.
4. C leaves the room.
5. I put a banana in the basket. (Only A and D see this - B and C are outside.)
6. D moves the banana from the basket to the bag. (Only A and D see this.)
7. I move the banana from the bag to the basket. (Only A and D see this.)

Current state of containers:
- Box: brick (unchanged since C put it there)
- Basket: banana
- Bag: empty

The question is: What is in the box?

C knows the brick is in the box because C put it there, and nothing happened to the box after that. C was present when the brick was placed and left afterward, but the box was never touched again.

So C should correctly answer "brick" - this would give the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell C false information, but C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). In fact, telling C something false might backfire or waste points.

Since C directly placed the brick in the box and nothing happened to the box after that, C has strong firsthand knowledge. Any attempt to mislead C would cost me 0.5 points and is very unlikely to work since C personally put the brick there.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. C puts a banana in the bag.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C leaves the room.
4. D moves the banana from the bag to the box.
5. D puts an apple in the bag.
6. D moves the apple from the bag to the basket.
7. D moves the banana from the box to the bag.

So the current state is: bag=banana, box=empty, basket=apple.

Now, what does C know? C was in the room when the banana was put in the bag, then C left. After C left, D did all the rearranging. C doesn't know about any of those moves. So C thinks the bag still contains the banana.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to C.

C will likely answer "banana" based on their last knowledge - and the bag actually DOES contain the banana (since D moved it back). So C would answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C wrong information to try to trick C into giving a wrong answer. But C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Let me think about the incentives. C knows I'm on the Blue team and would want C to answer incorrectly. If I tell C something, C might suspect I'm lying. 

If I Tell C that the bag contains something other than banana (like "apple"), C might think: "A is on the opposing team and wants me to get it wrong. A is telling me the bag has an apple. But I last saw a banana in the bag. A might be trying to confuse me, OR A might be telling the truth because D moved things around after I left."

The tricky part: C knows D was still in the room and could have moved things. So C has uncertainty about whether the banana is still in the bag. If I tell C the bag has an apple, C might think I'm lying (since I'm the opponent) and stick with banana - which would be correct.

Alternatively, if I tell C the bag has a banana (the truth), C might think "A is confirming what I already believe, but A is my opponent - maybe A is trying to trick me into being confident about a wrong answer... but banana is what I already think." This probably doesn't change anything.

What if I tell C something to make them second-guess? If I say the bag is empty or has something else, C might distrust me and stick with banana (correct answer). If I say banana, C stays with banana (correct).

Actually, the best play might be to Pass and save the 0.5 points, since any Tell action to C is likely to either be ignored or accidentally help them. C's default answer of "banana" happens to be correct, and trying to mislead C (who knows I'm an opponent) is unlikely to work and costs 0.5 points.

Pass
C answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D knows:**
- D was in the room initially and saw me put an apple in the bag.
- D moved the apple from the bag to the box.
- D put a stapler in the bag.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, nothing else happened (as far as I can see).

So D knows the bag contains a **stapler** (D put it there and nothing changed after D left before the question).

**The question:** I (the question asker/game master) will ask D what is in the bag. The bag currently contains a **stapler**. D knows this and will likely answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - costs nothing, but D will likely answer correctly (Red gets 1 point).
2. **Tell(D, bag, [something wrong])** - costs 0.5 points for Blue, but D knows what's in the bag since D put the stapler there. D would likely not be fooled since D has direct knowledge. This would waste 0.5 points.
3. **Ask** - doesn't help here.

Since D personally put the stapler in the bag and left the room (with no one else doing anything after), D has perfect knowledge of the bag's contents. Trying to deceive D would cost us 0.5 points and almost certainly fail since D has firsthand knowledge.

The best action is to not waste points on a futile deception attempt.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room initially and saw me put an apple in the bag.
- D was in the room when D moved the apple from the bag to the box.
- D was in the room when D put a stapler in the bag.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the apple from box to basket, I moved apple from basket to box, C moved apple from box to basket.
- D doesn't know about any changes after leaving.

**So D believes:** The bag contains a **stapler** (which D put there), and the box contains an **apple**.

**Current actual state:** The bag contains a **stapler**, the basket contains an **apple**, the box is **empty**.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to D.

D should answer **stapler**, which is correct! That would give the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell D false information to confuse them, but D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). D knows what they put in the bag and nothing happened to it after they left (from their perspective, nothing changed in the bag after they put the stapler there).

Since D will almost certainly answer correctly regardless of what I say (they have direct knowledge of putting the stapler in the bag and no reason to doubt it), spending 0.5 points to try to mislead D would likely just cost my team points without changing D's answer.

So D knows that when they left, the bag had a **stapler** in it. Since D left and doesn't know what happened after, D would likely answer **stapler** for the bag.

**What's actually in the bag now?**
After D left, C and I only moved the apple around (box → basket → box → basket). Nobody touched the bag. So the bag still contains the **stapler**.

D will likely answer "stapler" which is correct, giving the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell D wrong information, but D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). D saw themselves put the stapler in the bag and nothing happened to the bag after that from D's perspective. D would likely trust their own memory over an opponent's claim.

Spending 0.5 points to Tell D false information is risky - D would probably ignore it since they directly witnessed putting the stapler in the bag, and I'd lose 0.5 points for nothing.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Correct! The bag contains stapler.

-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a ball in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the ball from the bag to the box. ... D puts a stapler in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the ball from the box to the basket. ... C moves the stapler from the bag to the box. ...

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D saw:**
- Everyone starts in the room with empty containers
- A (me) puts a ball in the bag
- B leaves the room
- D moves the ball from the bag to the box
- D puts a stapler in the bag
- D leaves the room
- After D leaves: C moves ball from box to basket, C moves stapler from bag to box, then C moves stapler from box back to bag

**So D believes:**
- When D left, the ball was in the box and the stapler was in the bag
- D doesn't know what happened after they left
- So D thinks the bag contains: the stapler (which is actually correct, since C moved it back)

**The actual state:**
- Bag: stapler
- Box: empty
- Basket: ball

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the bag.

D will likely answer "stapler" because that's what was in the bag when D left, and D has no information about changes after leaving.

Since D is on the Red team, and the question is directed at D, if D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. The bag currently contains the stapler, and D thinks it contains the stapler - so D would answer correctly.

I could try to Tell D wrong information to mislead them, but D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. However, it's worth trying since if D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get the point.

Let me try to mislead D by telling them the bag contents changed.

Tell(D, bag, ball)

This might make D second-guess themselves, thinking C moved the ball back to the bag after D left. Since D knows C was still in the room, D might believe things changed. This costs 0.5 points but could prevent Red from gaining 1 point.

**Tell(D, bag, ball)**
D answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what D knows:
- D was in the room initially and put a brick in the basket.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, C put a stapler in the box, B moved the stapler from box to bag, and I moved the stapler from bag to box.
- D doesn't know about any of these movements since D was outside the room.

So D knows:
- D put a brick in the basket.
- D is unaware of any changes after leaving.

The question is: "What is in the basket?"

The basket currently contains: a brick (it was put there by D and never moved).

So D should correctly answer "brick" since D saw themselves put the brick in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that (even though D wouldn't know about the other movements, the basket wasn't touched).

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), there's nothing I can do to prevent this. D isn't going to ask me or trust me if I try to mislead them. If I Tell D false information, it costs my team 0.5 points, and D (being on the opposing team) would likely not trust me anyway - or might even be more confident in their original answer.

The best action is to Pass, since any action would cost 0.5 points and is unlikely to change D's correct answer.

Pass
D answers: brick

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the optimal action is.

**What D knows:**
- D was in the room when the brick was put in the basket.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, various moves happened with the stapler, but the basket was never touched again.
- D knows the brick is still in the basket (since D has no reason to think otherwise).

**What's actually in the basket:**
- The brick was put in the basket, and it was never moved. So the basket still contains the brick.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket.

D should know the answer correctly - D saw the brick placed in the basket and then left. Nothing happened to the basket after D left (only the stapler was moved around between the bag and box). So D should correctly answer "brick" and Red gets 1 point.

**Should I take an action?**
- I could try to Tell D false information to trick them, like Tell(D, basket, stapler) to make D doubt their knowledge. But D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.
- Spending 0.5 points on a Tell that D will likely ignore (since I'm on the Blue team, the opposing team) would just cost us points.
- D has strong reason to believe the brick is still in the basket, and as an opponent, D should be skeptical of anything I tell them.

The best action is to Pass, since any deceptive Tell is unlikely to work and would cost 0.5 points.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
- D was in the room initially and put a banana in the basket.
- D left the room.
- After D left, several moves happened that D is unaware of:
  - B moved the banana from basket to bag
  - I put a ball in the basket
  - B moved the ball from basket to box
  - I moved the banana from bag to basket

So D last saw: banana in the basket. D doesn't know about any changes after leaving.

Current actual state: banana is in the basket, ball is in the box, bag is empty.

D will be asked what's in the basket. D will likely answer "banana" based on what they last saw (since they don't know about the moves that happened after they left).

The actual answer is banana - so D's guess of "banana" would be correct! That would give the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? Let me think...

I could Tell D false information to mislead them. For example, I could tell D that the basket contains something else (like the ball), hoping D changes their answer. But this costs 0.5 points.

However, D knows I'm on the opposing team, so D might not trust my information. If D is rational, they'd likely ignore misleading information from an opponent.

Actually, let me reconsider. If I tell D something false, D might reason: "My opponent is trying to mislead me, so the opposite might be true." This could backfire in complex ways.

The risk is: if I spend 0.5 points to Tell D false info and D ignores it, Red gets 1 point and we lose 0.5 points (net: Blue=-0.5, Red=1). If I Pass and D answers correctly, it's Blue=0, Red=1. 

If I tell D false info and D believes it, Red gets 0 points and Blue loses 0.5 (net: Blue=-0.5, Red=0).

But D, being rational and knowing I'm an opponent, is unlikely to trust me. So telling false info likely just costs us 0.5 for nothing.

I should Pass.

Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when I put a banana in the basket.
2. C then left the room.
3. After C left: B moved the banana from the basket to the bag, and I put a brick in the basket.

So C last saw the basket containing a banana. C doesn't know about the banana being moved or the brick being placed, since those happened after C left.

C will likely answer "banana" for the basket, since that's what C last saw there. But the correct answer is "brick."

Since C is on the Red team, I want C to answer incorrectly. C will probably say "banana" which IS incorrect (the basket actually contains a brick). So C answering based on their own knowledge would be wrong - that's good for my team.

However, I need to be careful. D was in the room the entire time (D never left), so D saw everything. D knows the basket contains a brick. If D tells C the truth, C could answer correctly and Red gets a point.

But wait - it's MY turn for the action phase. D hasn't had a turn yet to tell C anything. Let me consider whether I should:

1. **Pass** - C will likely answer "banana" (wrong), which is good for Blue. Costs 0 points.
2. **Tell C something misleading** - I could reinforce C's wrong belief, but that costs 0.5 points and C already believes it's a banana.

The risk is that D might get a turn before the answer phase to tell C the truth. But I don't know the turn order. If I pass, I save 0.5 points and C likely answers wrong anyway.

Actually, let me reconsider - D might have already had a turn or might get one. But the scenario says "It is your turn," suggesting turns happen sequentially. If other players get turns too, D could tell C the correct answer.

Still, passing is optimal here. C's default belief is "banana" (wrong), and spending 0.5 points to tell C something they already believe is wasteful.

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether I should help C or not.

Let me trace through the scenario from C's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room. The bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. I put a banana in the basket. (C sees this)
3. C leaves the room. (C no longer sees what happens)
4. B moves the banana from the basket to the bag. (C doesn't see this)
5. I put a brick in the basket. (C doesn't see this)
6. B leaves the room. (C knows B left)
7. D moves the banana from the bag to the box. (C doesn't see this)
8. I move the banana from the box to the bag. (C doesn't see this)
9. D moves the banana from the bag to the box. (C doesn't see this)

So from C's perspective, the last thing C saw was me putting a banana in the basket. C doesn't know about any subsequent changes.

The actual contents of the basket: After I put a brick in the basket (step 5), the brick is in the basket. Nothing else was moved into or out of the basket after that. So the basket currently contains a **brick**.

C is on the Red team. If C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. If C answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points.

C likely thinks the banana is still in the basket (since that's the last thing C saw before leaving). C would answer "banana," which is wrong. That's good for my team.

However, C might ask teammates for help. D is on C's team and was in the room the whole time. D saw everything that happened after C left. D knows the brick is in the basket.

Since C is on the opposing team, I want C to answer incorrectly. I should **not** help C. 

But could I actively mislead C? I could tell C something wrong. However, C might be suspicious of information from an opponent. 

The best play is to simply Pass. C will likely think the banana is still in the basket (wrong answer), unless D helps C during D's turn. I shouldn't waste points or give C any information.

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

Now, the question is: **I am going to ask C what is in the basket.**

- If I Pass, C will likely answer "banana" (wrong) - good for Blue team.
- If I Tell C something, I could mislead or help - but C is on the opposing team.
- I could tell C wrong information, but C already likely has wrong information, so that's unnecessary.

Let me trace through what C saw:

2. C left the room.
3. After C left: B moved stapler from basket to box, D moved stapler from box to basket, B moved stapler from basket to bag, I put a brick in the basket.

So C last saw the stapler go into the basket. C doesn't know about any moves after leaving.

Now, the current state: the basket contains a **brick**, and the bag contains the **stapler**.

C will likely answer "stapler" for the basket (based on what C last saw). That would be **wrong**, which is good for my team since C is on the Red team.

But wait - D was in the room the entire time and saw everything. D knows the basket has a brick. D and C are teammates. It's currently my turn, and then there may be more turns before C answers.

The question is whether D will get a turn to tell C the correct answer before C is asked. If D gets a turn, D could Tell(C, basket, brick) and help C answer correctly.

Since C will likely answer incorrectly without help (saying "stapler" instead of "brick"), I should Pass to avoid spending points. C's wrong answer means Red gets 0 points, and we lose nothing.

There's a risk that D might get a turn to correct C, but I can't prevent that. Spending 0.5 points to tell C wrong information wouldn't help since C might not trust me (I'm on the opposing team), and D could still correct C.

- So D thinks the bag still contains the banana.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

**The correct answer:** The bag currently contains an **orange**.

**D's likely answer:** D will probably say **banana** (based on outdated information), which is **wrong**.

Since D is on the Red team, if D answers incorrectly, that's good for my Blue team (Red doesn't get a point). I should NOT help D get the right answer.

However, I should consider whether D's teammate C might help. C was in the room and saw everything - C knows the bag has an orange. But it's MY turn right now, not C's turn. So C can't act right now.

The best action for me is to **Pass** - I don't want to spend points, and D is likely to answer incorrectly on their own, which benefits my team.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would help my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when B put a banana in the bag.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, C moved things around, but D doesn't know about any of that.
- So D thinks the banana is still in the bag.

**Current actual state:**
- Bag: orange
- Basket: banana
- Box: empty

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag.
- D will likely answer "banana" (based on what D last saw).
- The correct answer is "orange."
- So D will answer incorrectly, meaning Red gets 0 points.

Since D is going to answer wrong anyway (benefiting Blue by not giving Red a point), I don't need to spend points to influence this outcome. Any Tell action to D would cost 0.5 points and could actually *help* Red if I told D the truth. I should not help the opposing team.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when B put a banana in the bag.
- B left the room (D saw this).
- D left the room next.
- After D left: C moved the banana from bag to box, C put an orange in the bag, and I moved the banana around.
- D is unaware of anything that happened after D left.

So D thinks the banana is still in the bag (since that's the last thing D saw before leaving).

**The actual state:**
- Bag: orange
- Box: banana
- Basket: empty

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

D will likely answer "banana" based on what D knows, but the correct answer is "orange."

Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer incorrectly. D currently believes the bag contains a banana, which is wrong. If I do nothing, D will likely say "banana" and get it wrong — which is good for my team.

However, there's a risk: C is on D's team and C knows the true contents (C was in the room for everything). C could Tell D the correct answer during C's turn. But the action phase might only be my turn right now.

Wait - let me re-read. It says "It is your turn." So this is just my turn in the action phase. Other players may also get turns before the answer phase.

If C gets a turn before D answers, C could Tell(D, bag, orange) which would cost Red 0.5 points but gain them 1 point (net +0.5).

I should Pass here. D currently has wrong information, which benefits me. Any action I take would either cost my team points or potentially help the Red team. If I Tell D wrong information, it costs me 0.5 points and D might already be wrong anyway. If I pass, I save points and D is likely to answer incorrectly.

The risk is C telling D the truth, but I can't prevent that.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D saw:** D was in the room when B put the apple in the box. Then B left, then D left. After D left, C moved the apple around and eventually put it in the bag, and put an orange in the box. D didn't see any of this.

**So D believes:** The apple is in the box (since that's the last thing D saw before leaving).

**The actual contents of the box:** An orange.

**I will be asked D what is in the box.** D will likely answer "apple" based on what D knows. That would be wrong (the correct answer is "orange"), which means Red gets 0 points from this question.

Now, should I take an action? 

- If I **Pass**, D will answer "apple" (wrong). Red gets 0 points. This costs me nothing.
- If I **Tell(D, box, orange)**, D might use this information to answer correctly, giving Red 1 point. This would cost my team 0.5 points AND help Red. Terrible idea.
- If I **Tell(D, box, apple)**, this reinforces D's wrong belief, but D already believes that. Costs 0.5 points for no benefit.
- If I **Ask** someone something, it costs 0.5 points and doesn't help since I already know everything.

The best action is to **Pass**. D will answer incorrectly, Red scores nothing, and I lose nothing.

Pass
D answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- D put a brick in the bag, then left the room.
- After D left, C also left.
- Then B moved the brick from the bag to the box, and put a banana in the bag.

**What D knows:**
- D saw themselves put a brick in the bag.
- D left the room before any changes were made.
- D knows C left after them, but doesn't know about any object movements.
- So D believes the bag still contains the brick.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag.
- D will likely answer "brick" (since that's what D last saw).
- The correct answer is "banana" (since B moved the brick and put a banana in the bag).
- If D answers "brick," Red gets 0 points (wrong answer).

**My options:**
- **Pass:** D will likely say "brick" and be wrong. Red gets 0 points. This is good for Blue.
- **Tell(D, bag, banana):** This would help D get the right answer, giving Red 1 point, and costing Blue 0.5 points. Terrible for Blue.
- **Tell(D, bag, brick):** This would reinforce D's wrong belief... but it costs 0.5 points for no benefit since D already thinks it's a brick.

The best action is to **Pass** — D will almost certainly answer incorrectly, and we lose no points.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- D was in the room when the brick was put in the bag, then D left.
- After D left: B moved the brick from bag→box, put a banana in the bag, moved brick from box→basket, I moved brick from basket→box, B moved brick from box→basket.
- Current state: bag has banana, basket has brick, box is empty.
- D only saw the brick being put in the bag, then left. D doesn't know about any subsequent moves.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag.

**D's perspective:** D last saw a brick put in the bag, then left. D would likely answer "brick" since that's what D last knew was in the bag.

**The correct answer:** The bag contains a banana.

So D will likely answer "brick," which is **wrong**. That means Red gets 0 points from this question. This is good for my team!

**Should I take an action?**
- If I Tell D the truth (banana in the bag), D would answer correctly and Red gets 1 point. Bad for me.
- If I Tell D something false, D might use that info, but D might also be suspicious.
- If I Pass, D will likely answer "brick" (wrong), and Red gets 0 points.

The optimal play is to Pass, since D is likely to answer incorrectly without any intervention.

Action: I need to think about this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a stapler in the basket (I know this).
- C put a brick in the box (I saw this since I was in the room).
- I left the room, then B left the room.
- After I left, I don't know what happened in the room. C was still in the room after both B and I left.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the basket.

**What C knows:** C was in the room the entire time (never described as leaving). C saw me put the stapler in the basket. C also knows everything that happened after I left, since C stayed in the room.

**Key consideration:** After I left (and after B left), C was alone in the room. C could have moved objects around. But the scenario only describes what I can observe - since I left, I wouldn't know if C moved anything.

However, the scenario describes events as they happened. The scenario says "You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ..." and nothing else. But wait - the scenario is told from MY perspective. Since I left the room, I wouldn't see any actions C took after I left.

**So what does C know?** C knows what's actually in the basket right now (whether C moved things or not). C saw me put the stapler in the basket. If C didn't move anything, the stapler is still there. If C did move it, C would know what's there now.

**Strategy:** C is on the Red team. C will be asked what's in the basket. C will answer correctly (since C knows the actual state of the room) and Red gets 1 point regardless of what I do.

Since C has full knowledge of the room's current state, there's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly. Any Ask or Tell action would cost my team 0.5 points without benefit.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A (me), B, and C are in the room. I put an orange in the basket.
2. C leaves the room. (C knows: orange is in basket)
3. I move the orange from basket to box. (C doesn't see this)
4. C enters the room. (C doesn't know about the move; C thinks orange is still in basket)
5. B puts a stapler in the basket. (C sees this - C now knows stapler is in basket)
6. I leave the room.
7. B leaves the room.

So the current state: basket has a stapler, box has an orange.

C saw B put a stapler in the basket. So C knows the basket contains a stapler.

The correct answer is **stapler**. C witnessed B putting the stapler in the basket, so C should know the answer is a stapler.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), there's nothing I can do to prevent that. Any Tell action to C would cost us 0.5 points and C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). I could try to mislead C, but C directly saw B put the stapler in the basket, so C won't be confused by misinformation.

The best action is to not spend any points.

Action: The question will be asked to C, who is on the Red team. C was in the room the entire time and witnessed everything that happened, so C knows exactly what's in the basket (a stapler).

Since C is on the opposing team and knows the correct answer, there's nothing I can do to help or hinder here. Any Ask or Tell action would cost my team 0.5 points unnecessarily.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what C knows about the basket, and whether I should help C or not.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room.
2. B puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. C puts a ball in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
4. B moves the ball from the bag to the box. (Everyone sees this.)
5. B moves the ball from the box to the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
6. D moves the ball from the bag to the box. (Everyone sees this.)
7. I (A) leave the room.

So at the point I leave, the state is:
- Basket: stapler
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty

C was in the room the entire time (at least up to when I left). C saw B put the stapler in the basket. Nothing else happened to the basket after that (at least while I was in the room).

After I left the room, I don't know what happened. Something could have changed. But the question is about what C knows.

C is on the Red team. The question is asking C what's in the basket. C saw the stapler go into the basket, and unless something happened after I left that moved the stapler, C would know the answer is "stapler."

Since C is on the opposing team, I do NOT want to help C. If C already knows the correct answer, there's nothing I can do to hurt them (I can't lie to them in a Tell and expect them to believe me, since they know I'm on the opposing team).

C likely knows the basket contains a stapler (assuming nothing changed after I left). Telling C wrong information would be suspicious since C saw the stapler placed there and C is on the Red team - they'd have no reason to trust me.

There's nothing beneficial I can do here. I should Pass to avoid spending points.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the apple from the basket to the bag. ... C enters the room. ... You put a stapler in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what C knows about the basket.

Let me trace through C's perspective:

1. C is in the room initially and sees B put an apple in the basket.
2. C leaves the room.
3. While C is outside: D moves the apple from the basket to the bag. C doesn't see this.
4. C enters the room.
5. C sees me put a stapler in the basket.
6. C sees me leave the room.

So from C's perspective:
- The apple was put in the basket (C saw this)
- C left and came back - C missed the apple being moved to the bag
- C saw me put a stapler in the basket

Now, C knows the stapler is in the basket (C saw me put it there). But C might think the apple is still in the basket too - wait, no, a container can only hold one object. So when C saw me put the stapler in the basket, C would understand the stapler replaced whatever was there. 

Actually, C might think the apple was still in the basket when I put the stapler in. Since containers hold at most one object, putting the stapler in would displace the apple. But C saw me put the stapler in the basket, so C knows the basket contains the stapler.

C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the basket. C knows the stapler is in the basket (C witnessed me putting it there). So C will likely answer "stapler" and get 1 point for the Red team.

Since C already has the correct information (the stapler is indeed in the basket), there's nothing I can do to help my team here. I could try to mislead C with a Tell action, but C saw me put the stapler in the basket with their own eyes, so they'd likely not believe a lie.

The best action is to not spend points on a futile attempt to mislead.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: Let me trace through the scenario carefully:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. I (A) leave the room. (I can't see what happens while I'm out.)
4. I (A) enter the room. (I can now see what happens again.)
5. C moves the stapler from the **bag** to the **basket**. (This means while I was outside, someone must have moved the stapler from the basket to the bag. Now C moves it back from the bag to the basket.)
6. C leaves the room.

So at the end of the scenario, the stapler is in the basket (C moved it from the bag to the basket in step 5, which I witnessed).

Since I'm being asked what is in the basket, and I know the stapler is in the basket, I don't need to spend points asking anyone.

I know what's in the basket - I personally put a ball in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that (I was in the room the entire time until I left, and no one moved anything from the basket). So I can confidently answer "ball" when asked.
A answers: ball
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

Action: The banana was put in the basket, then C moved it to the box, then D moved it back to the basket. All of this happened while I was in the room (I saw these events). Then I left the room.

After I left, I don't know if anything else happened. Let me check: the scenario ends with "You leave the room. ..." — the ellipsis suggests time passed after I left, during which things could have happened that I'm unaware of.

Who was in the room when I left? Let me trace:
- Start: A, B, C, D in room
- C leaves
- B leaves
- I put banana in basket
- B enters
- C enters (now A, B, C, D all in room)
- I leave (B, C, D in room)
- I enter (A, B, C, D in room)
- C moves banana from basket to box
- D moves banana from box to basket
- I leave (B, C, D remain in room)
- ... (time passes, things could happen)

So after I left, B, C, and D are still in the room. Something might have changed. I should ask someone who stayed in the room.

B is my teammate, so asking B costs 0.5 points but if B gives me the correct info, I gain 1 point for answering correctly (net +0.5). If I guess without asking, I might be right (banana in basket) or wrong if something changed.

Since B is my teammate and would tell the truth, and there's a risk something changed after I left, I should ask B.

Ask(B, basket)
A answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

The answer is straightforward. I was in the room when B put an apple in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that while I was still in the room. After I left, B also left, so only C and D remained. While they could have moved things around after we left, I need to answer based on what I know.

However, I should consider that C and D might have changed the basket's contents after B and I left. But since I'm being asked what's in the basket, I'll go with what I last knew: the apple was in the basket.

I'll Pass since I don't need any additional information - I saw the apple placed in the basket myself.

Action: The stapler was put in the basket by B. Then D moved it to the box, then C moved it back to the basket. All of this happened while I was in the room. Then I left, then B left.

After I left, C and D were still in the room. They could have moved things around. But I need to consider what I know versus what might have happened.

When I left the room, the stapler was in the basket. After I left, only C and D remained in the room, and they could have moved the stapler. I don't know what happened after I left.

Since I'm being asked what's in the basket, and I'm uncertain because C and D were alone in the room after I left, I should ask my teammate B. But B also left the room after me, so B wouldn't know what happened after they left either.

However, B left after me. Let me re-read: "You leave the room. ... B leaves the room." So after I left, B was still in the room with C and D for some time. B might have seen something happen before B left. Then after B left, C and D were alone.

So B might have additional information about what happened between my departure and B's departure. Let me ask B.

The answer is straightforward. I was in the room when C put an orange in the box. After that, I left the room, but I already witnessed the orange being placed in the box. While things could have changed after I left, I need to consider what I know.

Let me reconsider - after I left, C was still in the room with B and D. C then left the room. B and D remained. Something could have changed, but based on what I directly observed, the orange was in the box.

I'll Pass since I already know the orange was placed in the box, and I can save the 0.5 points. If something changed after I left, I'd need to ask B, but the most likely answer is still the orange.

Action: The stapler was in the bag when I left the room. Let me trace through what I know:

1. B puts a stapler in the bag.
2. I leave the room.
3. I enter the room (nothing changed that I'm unaware of since I can see the state when I enter... actually, I'm not told what happened while I was out, but I re-enter and can observe).
4. D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket.
5. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.
6. I leave the room.

After step 6, the stapler is in the bag. However, after I leave, D (who is still in the room) could potentially move things around. B might also still be in the room.

Wait - let me re-read. The scenario says "You, B, and D are in a room." Then after I leave the second time, D (and possibly B) are still in the room and could move things. I don't know what happened after I left the second time.

So the stapler was in the bag when I left, but D could have moved it. I should ask someone who's still in the room.

But wait - the question is directed at me. I need to figure out if anything changed after I left. B is my teammate and would presumably tell me the truth. Let me ask B.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room.
2. C puts a stapler in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. I put a brick in the basket. (Only me and C see this)
6. C moves the brick from the basket to the box. (Only me and C see this)
7. I move the brick from the box to the basket. (Only me and C see this)

The question is: What is in the bag?

B was in the room when C put the stapler in the bag. B then left, and nothing happened to the bag after that. So B knows the stapler is in the bag.

B should be able to answer this correctly on their own - they saw C put the stapler in the bag, and they have no reason to think it was moved (nothing happened to the bag after B left, and B would know that only me and C remained in the room).

Since B already knows the answer, I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B needs help answering "what is in the bag?"

Let me trace through what B saw:
- B was in the room when C put a stapler in the bag.
- Then D left the room.
- Then B left the room.
- After B left, various movements happened with the brick, but nothing happened to the bag.

So B saw the stapler go into the bag, and nothing has changed in the bag since then. B should know the bag contains a stapler.

Since B already knows the correct answer (stapler is in the bag), there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B.

B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. C moves the brick from the box to the bag. (Only A and C see this)
6. C puts an apple in the box. (Only A and C see this)
7. C moves the apple from the box to the basket. (Only A and C see this)
8. C moves the brick from the bag to the box. (Only A and C see this)

So the current state is:
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty
- Basket: apple

B left the room after seeing C put a brick in the box. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. So B would think the box still contains a brick.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B.

B's last knowledge is that the brick is in the box. The actual answer is also the brick (since C moved it back to the box at the end).

So B would naturally answer "brick" which is correct! We get 1 point without me needing to spend 0.5 points on a Tell action.

I should Pass.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the correct answer is.

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) in the room. B puts an orange in the basket.
2. D leaves the room.
3. I (A) move the orange from the basket to the bag.
4. I (A) put a stapler in the basket.
5. B leaves the room.

**What B knows:**
- B was present for all events except anything after B left (but B left last in the scenario).
- B saw: orange put in basket, D leaving, orange moved to bag, stapler put in basket, then B left.
- So B knows the basket contains a **stapler**.

**What's actually in the basket:** A stapler.

Since B was present when I moved the orange and put the stapler in the basket, B knows the basket contains a stapler. B has the correct information already.

I should Pass to save points, since B already knows the correct answer.

B answers: stapler

9. I move the orange from the bag to the box. (Only C and I see this)

Current state of containers:
- Basket: stapler
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty

What B knows (from what B saw before leaving):
- Orange was moved from basket to bag (step 4)
- Stapler was put in basket (step 5)
- B left after step 5, so B's last knowledge: basket = stapler, bag = orange, box = empty

B will be asked what's in the basket. Based on B's knowledge, B should answer **stapler**, which is correct! The basket does contain the stapler.

So B already knows the correct answer to this question. I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

What B knows (from what B saw before leaving):
- Basket: stapler (B saw me put the stapler in the basket)
- Bag: orange (B saw me move the orange to the bag)
- Box: empty

B doesn't know about steps 7 and 8 (moving orange from bag to box, then box to bag), but those cancel out anyway. So B would think the basket has a stapler, which is correct!

B will be asked what's in the basket. B should answer "stapler" based on B's knowledge, and that IS the correct answer. So B should get this right without any help from me.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone starts in the room. B puts a ball in the basket.
2. D leaves the room.
3. I move the ball from the basket to the box.
4. I put a stapler in the basket.
5. B leaves the room.
6. C moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.
7. C moves the stapler from the bag to the basket.

**Final state:**
- Bag: empty
- Box: ball
- Basket: stapler

**What B knows:**
- B saw the ball go into the basket (step 1).
- D left the room (B saw this).
- B saw me move the ball from basket to box (step 3).
- B saw me put a stapler in the basket (step 4).
- B left the room (step 5).
- B does NOT know about C's movements of the stapler (steps 6-7).
- So B thinks: Box = ball, Basket = stapler, Bag = empty.

**B will be asked what is in the basket.** B believes the basket contains the stapler, which is actually correct! (C moved the stapler out and back in.)

So B would answer "stapler" which is correct. We'd get 1 point.

Since B already knows the correct answer, I should Pass to avoid spending 0.5 points.

B will be asked what is in the basket. Let me trace through what B knows:

1. B was in the room and put a ball in the basket.
2. B then left the room.
3. After B left, D put a stapler in the bag, I moved the stapler from the bag to the box, and C moved the stapler from the box to the bag. B doesn't know about any of these actions since B was outside the room.

So from B's perspective, the ball is still in the basket. And in reality, the ball IS still in the basket - nobody moved the ball. The stapler was the only object moved around after B left.

Since B already knows the correct answer (the ball is in the basket), I don't need to tell B anything. I should Pass to save points.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

B was in the room when they put a ball in the basket. Then B left the room. After B left, various movements happened with the orange, but the basket was never touched again - the ball is still in the basket.

B knows they put a ball in the basket, and since B left the room before any other changes happened, B doesn't know about the orange movements. But importantly, the ball was never moved from the basket, so B's knowledge about the basket is still correct.

B will be asked what is in the basket. The answer is "ball" - and B knows this because B put the ball there and nothing happened to the basket before or after B left.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a banana in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
4. C moves the banana from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
5. D puts a stapler in the basket. (B doesn't see this)
6. C moves the stapler from the basket to the box. (B doesn't see this)
7. D moves the banana from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)

Final state:
- Bag: empty
- Box: stapler
- Basket: banana

B's knowledge: B last saw the banana in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So B would think the basket still contains the banana.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to B.

The basket actually contains the banana (D moved it back). B would guess banana based on B's last knowledge (B put the banana there before leaving).

So B would answer "banana" which is actually correct! The basket does contain the banana.

Since B will likely answer correctly without any help from me, I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone starts in the room. C puts a ball in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. C puts a stapler in the basket. (B doesn't see this)
5. D leaves the room.

**Current state:**
- Bag: ball
- Basket: stapler
- Box: empty

**What B knows:**
- B saw C put a ball in the basket, then B left.
- B doesn't know about the ball being moved to the bag or the stapler being put in the basket.
- B would think the basket still contains the ball.

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the basket. The correct answer is **stapler**.

B would guess "ball" based on their knowledge, which is wrong. I need to tell B the correct contents of the basket so our team gets the point.

Tell(B, basket, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D).
2. C puts a ball in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
4. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
5. C puts a stapler in the basket. (B doesn't see this)
6. D leaves the room.
7. C moves the ball from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)
8. I (A) move the ball from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
9. C moves the ball from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)

Current state of containers:
- **Basket**: stapler (placed in step 5, never moved)
- **Box**: ball (moved there in step 9)
- **Bag**: empty

B's knowledge: B last saw the room when the ball was in the basket (step 2). After B left, everything changed. B would think the ball is still in the basket.

The question is asking B what's in the basket. The correct answer is **stapler**. B likely thinks it's the **ball** (since that's the last thing B saw placed there).

I should tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Tell(B, basket, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me analyze what each player knows:

**Me (A):** I've been in the room the entire time, so I saw everything:
- D put an orange in the bag
- B left the room
- C left the room
- D moved the orange from the bag to the box
- D put a stapler in the bag
- So currently: bag = stapler, box = orange, basket = empty

**B:** B saw D put the orange in the bag, then B left. B didn't see D move the orange to the box or put the stapler in the bag. So B thinks the bag still contains the orange.

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the bag. The correct answer is **stapler**.

B doesn't know this - B thinks it's the orange. If B answers "orange," that's wrong, and Blue gets 0 points.

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, for a net of +0.5.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

- **Me (A):** I saw everything. The box currently contains an **apple**. The bag contains a **ball**. The basket is empty.
- **B:** B saw D put a ball in the box, then B left the room. B doesn't know about C moving the ball to the bag or C putting an apple in the box. So B thinks the box contains a **ball**.
- **C and D:** C knows everything (was in the room the whole time). D also saw everything since D never left.

The question will be asked to **B**: "What is in the box?"

B thinks the box contains a ball, but it actually contains an apple. If B answers "ball," our team gets 0 points. I need to tell B the correct answer.

The cost of a Tell action is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points. If I Pass, B will likely answer "ball" (incorrect) and we get 0 points.

So the best action is to tell B what's in the box.

- Bag: empty

B last saw: a ball put in the box, then left. B would think the box still contains the ball.

Since I'm going to be asked what B answers about the box, and B thinks the box has a ball (but it actually has an apple), I should tell B the truth so B can answer correctly.

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an orange in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. ... D moves the orange from the basket to the bag. ... C moves the orange from the bag to the box. ... C puts an apple in the bag. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts an orange in the bag.
3. B leaves the room.
4. After B leaves: C moves orange from bag to basket.
5. D moves orange from basket to bag.
6. C moves orange from bag to box.
7. C puts an apple in the bag.

So the current state is:
- Bag: apple
- Box: orange
- Basket: empty

B saw the orange go into the bag, then left. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. So B would think the bag still contains the orange.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B. The correct answer is **apple**.

B will likely answer "orange" (which is wrong) since that's the last thing B saw placed in the bag before leaving.

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer earns 1 point, so net gain is 0.5 points.

Tell(B, bag, apple)
B answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

You, B, and C are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a banana in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the banana from the basket to the bag. ... B enters the room. ... C puts a stapler in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ...

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. A, B, C are in the room. B puts banana in basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C moves banana from basket to bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. B enters the room.
5. C puts stapler in basket. (B sees this)
6. C leaves the room.

**What B knows:**
- B put banana in basket (saw this)
- B left the room
- B re-entered the room
- B saw C put stapler in basket
- B does NOT know that C moved the banana from basket to bag while B was out

So B knows the stapler is in the basket (B saw C put it there). B would correctly answer "stapler" for the basket.

Wait, let me reconsider. B saw C put a stapler in the basket. So B knows the basket contains a stapler. That's correct - the basket does contain a stapler.

So B will answer correctly without any help from me. The answer is "stapler" and B knows this.

I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the bag.

Let me trace through B's perspective:
1. B sees me put a stapler in the bag (B was in the room)
2. B leaves the room - B misses C moving the stapler from bag to basket
3. B enters the room - B misses nothing else while outside (D moved stapler from basket to bag while B was outside... wait, let me re-read)

Let me re-trace carefully:
1. All four players in room. I put stapler in bag. Everyone sees this.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C moves stapler from bag to basket. (B doesn't see this)
4. B enters the room.
5. D moves stapler from basket to bag. (B sees this)
6. C leaves the room.
7. D leaves the room.
8. I move stapler from bag to box. (B sees this)
9. B puts a brick in the bag. (B sees this)

So B's knowledge:
- B saw me put stapler in bag initially
- B missed C moving stapler to basket
- B saw D move stapler from basket to bag (B might wonder how it got to the basket, but B sees it moved to bag)
- B saw me move stapler from bag to box
- B put a brick in the bag

So B knows the bag contains a brick. B was present when they themselves put the brick in the bag.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" - the answer is **brick**.

B should know this correctly since B put the brick in the bag and was present the whole time after re-entering. B doesn't need any help here.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the bag.

Let me trace through B's perspective:
1. B is in the room and puts a ball in the bag. B knows: bag has ball.
2. B leaves the room. B is now unaware of what happens inside.
3. D moves the ball from the bag to the box. B doesn't see this.
4. B enters the room. B doesn't know about the move that happened while away.
5. D moves the ball from the box to the bag. B sees this happen - B sees D put the ball in the bag.

Wait, let me reconsider step 5. When B is in the room, B is aware of anything that happens. So B sees D move the ball from the box to the bag. This means B knows the ball is in the bag.

So B actually knows the ball is in the bag after step 5. B should be able to answer correctly.

I'll Pass to save points since B already has the correct information.

Action: The key question is whether B knows what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events from B's perspective:

1. B starts in the room with everyone.
2. D leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room. (B is now outside)
4. **I put a stapler in the bag.** (B is outside, so B doesn't see this)
5. B enters the room. (B is back inside, but doesn't know what happened while away)
6. D enters the room.
7. I leave the room.
8. B leaves the room.
9. B enters the room.

B was outside when I put the stapler in the bag, so B doesn't know the bag contains a stapler. I need to tell B.

Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and tell B, since B will be asked about it.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room. Bag, box, basket are all empty.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D puts a stapler in the basket.
4. I (A) put a brick in the bag.
5. D moves the brick from the bag to the box.
6. C moves the brick from the box to the bag.
7. I (A) leave the room.

So at the point I left the room, the state was:
- Basket: stapler
- Bag: brick
- Box: empty

B left before any objects were placed, so B has no idea what's in any container. B needs to know what's in the basket, which is the **stapler**.

I should tell B what's in the basket. However, I need to consider whether anything changed after I left the room. Since I left the room, C and D could have moved things around. But I have no information about what happened after I left - I only know the state as of when I left.

The risk is that C or D moved the stapler after I left. But with no information about that, my best guess is still that the stapler is in the basket. Telling B is worth the 0.5 point cost since getting the answer right earns 1 point.

Tell(B, basket, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what B needs to know to answer correctly.

B left the room before anything was placed in the containers. So B doesn't know what's in any container.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. B leaves the room.
2. D puts a stapler in the basket.
3. I put a banana in the bag.
4. C moves the banana from the bag to the box.

6. I move the banana from the bag to the box.
7. I leave the room.

Final state:
- Basket: stapler
- Box: banana
- Bag: empty

B needs to know that the basket contains a stapler. Since B was outside the room for all of this, B has no idea. I should tell B.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the basket and whether I need to help.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room. All containers are empty.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D puts a banana in the basket. (B is outside, so B doesn't see this. I'm inside, so I see it.)
4. I leave the room.
5. C leaves the room.
6. C enters the room. (C is now in the room alone - I don't know what happens inside.)
7. B enters the room. (B is now in the room, possibly with C - I don't know what happens inside.)
8. B leaves the room.

So B didn't see the banana being placed in the basket. When B entered the room (step 7), B could see what's happening but not inside containers. B can't see inside the basket, so B wouldn't know what's in it unless someone told B or B saw something being placed/removed.

The key question: Did C do anything while alone in the room (between steps 6 and 7), or while with B (between steps 7 and 8)? I don't know because I was outside. But from B's perspective, B entered the room and then left - B would have seen anything that happened while B was in the room, but B can't see inside containers.

B doesn't know what's in the basket. The banana was placed there while B was outside, and B can't see inside containers. Unless C moved the banana while B was present, B wouldn't know.

Since I saw the banana go into the basket, and B is my teammate who will be asked about the basket, I should tell B what's in the basket. However, there's a risk that C moved the banana while I was outside. But I have no information about that - the best information I have is that the banana is in the basket.

The cost is 0.5 points, but a correct answer gives 1 point, so the expected value is positive.

Tell(B, basket, banana)
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- I put a ball in the bag.
- B, C, and D all saw me put the ball in the bag (they were all in the room).
- Then B left the room.
- Then C left the room.
- D is still in the room with me.
- Nothing else happened to the bag after I put the ball in it.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag.

**What C knows:** C saw me put the ball in the bag. After that, C left the room. C knows that after she left, she doesn't know if anything changed. But from C's perspective, the last thing she saw was the ball being placed in the bag. However, C is on the Red team and wants to answer correctly (it would give the Red team a point).

**Key insight:** C saw the ball go into the bag and nothing happened to the bag after that. C should know the answer is "ball." Since C is on the Red team, if C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?** 

- I could Tell C false information, like Tell(C, bag, "empty") to try to trick C into giving a wrong answer. But C saw me put the ball in the bag, so C would likely not believe me.
- C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team), and C directly witnessed the ball being placed in the bag. Nothing happened after C left that would change the bag's contents.

Since C directly observed the ball being placed in the bag and has no reason to doubt their own observation, any attempt to mislead C would cost me 0.5 points and almost certainly fail. The best move is to not waste points.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Action: Looking at this situation, I need to figure out what C knows and whether C will answer correctly.

Let me trace through what C observed:
1. C was in the room when I put a ball in the bag. ✓ C knows bag = ball
2. B leaves the room (C still inside)
3. C leaves the room - after this point, C doesn't see anything else

So C saw me put the ball in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. The ball is still in the bag.

C knows the correct answer: the bag contains a ball.

Since C is on the Red team, if C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. I need to consider whether I can mislead C.

I could Tell C false information about the bag to try to confuse them. However, C directly witnessed me putting the ball in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after C left. C has no reason to doubt their own observation. If I tell C something different, C would likely be suspicious since they saw it themselves.

But it's worth trying - if I tell C that I moved the ball out of the bag after C left, C might believe it since C couldn't see what happened after leaving. Let me think about what C knows happened after they left: C knows D was still in the room with me, and various things could have happened.

I'll try to mislead C by telling them the bag's contents changed.

Tell(C, bag, orange)

This suggests the ball was moved out and the orange is now in the bag. Since C knows objects were being moved around, and C left before the later movements, C might believe the bag's contents changed. This costs 0.5 points but could prevent Red from scoring 1 point.

**Tell(C, bag, orange)**
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and whether I need to take any action.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when I put a ball in the bag. ✓ C knows the bag has a ball.
2. B leaves the room. C sees this.
3. C leaves the room. After this, C doesn't see anything else that happens.

So C knows the bag contains a ball (since nothing happened to the bag after C left - the ball stayed in the bag the whole time).

The question is: What is in the bag? The answer is: a ball. C knows this because C was present when I put the ball in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag before or after C left.

C should answer correctly on their own, which means Red gets 1 point. There's nothing I can do to prevent that since I can't communicate with C (well, I could Tell C wrong information, but C saw me put the ball in the bag, so C would likely trust their own memory).

Actually, wait - I *could* try to Tell C something false to confuse them. Let me think about whether that's worth it.

If I Tell C that the bag contains something else, C might get confused. But C directly witnessed me putting the ball in the bag, and C left before anything else happened to the bag. C would likely trust their own observation over my tell. Plus, it would cost me 0.5 points.

The risk of spending 0.5 points to try to deceive C (who has direct knowledge) seems not worth it. C will almost certainly trust their own memory.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether I should take an action.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. I put a brick in the bag (everyone in room: A, B, C, D)
2. B leaves the room (everyone aware)
3. C leaves the room (everyone aware)
4. D moves brick from bag to box (only A and D see this)
5. D puts apple in bag (only A and D see this)
6. D moves apple from bag to basket (only A and D see this)
7. D moves brick from box to bag (only A and D see this)

**Current state:** Bag = brick, Box = empty, Basket = apple

**What C knows:** C was present when I put the brick in the bag, then C left. C didn't see any of D's movements. So C thinks the bag still has the brick in it.

**The question:** I'm going to be asked what C thinks is in the bag. Wait, no - C will be asked what is in the bag.

C's last knowledge of the bag is that it contains a brick. Since C left before any changes were made, C will likely answer "brick."

The actual contents of the bag IS a brick (D moved it back). So C would answer "brick" which is correct - meaning the Red team gets 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C something false to mislead them. For example, I could tell C the bag contains something else. But that costs 0.5 points, and C might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team.

However, C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the Blue team, C is on Red). C knows I might lie. But if I tell C something different, it might create doubt.

Let me think about this strategically. If I tell C the bag contains, say, an apple, C might think: "A is on the opposing team, they might be lying to trick me. But they also might be telling the truth since D could have moved things after I left." This could cause C to second-guess their answer.

The cost is 0.5 points. If C changes their answer from brick (correct) to something wrong, Red loses 1 point and we lose 0.5 - net gain of 0.5 for us. If C doesn't change their answer, we just lose 0.5 points.

It's risky. C might reason that since I'm an opponent, I'm trying to mislead them, and stick with brick. The expected value depends on how likely C is to be misled.

I think the risk of losing 0.5 points outweighs the uncertain benefit. C will likely distrust me. But let me reconsider - if I tell C something convincing...

Actually, telling C "apple" might work because D *did* put an apple in the bag at one point. But C doesn't know that.

I think the safest play is to try to mislead C. The potential upside (preventing Red from scoring) is worth the 0.5 cost.

Tell(C, bag, apple)
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would be optimal here.

**What I know:**
- C put a stapler in the bag
- B left the room
- D moved the stapler from the bag to the box
- C put a ball in the bag
- D left the room

So currently: bag = ball, box = stapler, basket = empty.

**What D knows:**
- D was present when C put the stapler in the bag
- D moved the stapler from the bag to the box
- D was present when C put the ball in the bag
- D then left the room

So D knows the ball is in the bag. D will answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.

**Should I use Tell to mislead D?** No — Tell actions are private, and D is on the Red team. I could try to Tell D false information, but D has direct knowledge of what happened. D saw C put the ball in the bag before leaving. D would have no reason to believe my misinformation over their own direct observation.

**Should I Ask or Tell B?** The question is being asked to D, not to B, so helping B doesn't matter for this round.

Since D already knows the correct answer (ball is in the bag) and I can't change that, spending 0.5 points on any action would just cost my team points without benefit.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Current state: **bag has a ball**, basket has a stapler, box is empty.

Now, what does D know? D left after step 6. At that point, from D's perspective:
- Bag: ball (C put it there in step 5)
- Box: stapler (D moved it there in step 4)
- Basket: empty

D doesn't know about steps 7-9 (stapler moving around between box and basket).

So D would think the bag contains a **ball**, which is actually correct! The bag does contain a ball.

Since D's belief about the bag (ball) matches reality (ball), D should answer correctly on their own. I don't need to spend points telling D anything.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a stapler in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the bag to the box. ... C puts a ball in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the stapler from the box to the basket. ...

Respond with your action.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through the scenario from each player's perspective:

**What actually happened:**
1. All four players in room. C puts stapler in bag.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves stapler from bag to box.
4. C puts ball in bag.
5. D leaves the room.
6. C moves stapler from box to basket.
7. I move stapler from basket to box.
8. C moves stapler from box to basket.

**Final state:** Bag has ball, basket has stapler, box is empty.

**What D knows:**
- D was present for steps 1-4, then left at step 5.
- D saw: stapler put in bag, stapler moved to box, ball put in bag.
- D left after step 4, so D's last knowledge is: box has stapler, bag has ball.
- D doesn't know about steps 6-8 (stapler moving around).

**The question is: What is in the bag?** Asked to D.

D believes the bag has a ball (which is actually correct! The ball was put in the bag in step 4 and was never moved).

So D will likely answer "ball" which is **correct**. That would give Red 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell D something misleading about the bag's contents, but D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). D saw the ball go into the bag and never saw it removed, so D would likely trust their own knowledge.

Alternatively, I could Tell D false information, but D would probably ignore it since they directly observed the ball being placed in the bag and never saw it removed.

Since D is likely to answer correctly regardless of what I do, spending 0.5 points to Tell D misleading information is risky - D probably won't believe me, and I'd lose 0.5 points for nothing.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

D moves the orange from the box to the bag. ... C puts a ball in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. ... C moves the ball from the box to the bag. ...

Respond with your action.

Action: I need to figure out what D knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what D saw:

1. Everyone starts in the room. C puts an orange in the box. (D sees this)
2. B leaves the room. (D sees this)
3. D moves the orange from the box to the bag. (D knows this - D did it)
4. C puts a ball in the box. (D sees this)
5. D leaves the room. (D sees this - but after this point, D doesn't see anything)
6. After D leaves: C moves the orange from the bag to the basket.
7. C moves the ball from the box to the bag.
8. C moves the ball from the bag to the box.

So from D's perspective, when D left the room:
- Bag: orange
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

D doesn't know about the movements that happened after D left. So D would think the box contains the **ball**.

The actual current state is:
- Bag: empty
- Box: ball (C moved ball to bag, then back to box)
- Basket: orange

So D's belief is that the box contains a ball, and the actual contents of the box IS a ball.

D will be asked what's in the box. D thinks it's a ball, and it actually is a ball. So D will likely answer correctly, earning Red 1 point.

I'm on the Blue team, so I want D to answer incorrectly. I could Tell D false information to mislead D. Since D knows I was in the room the whole time, D might trust me (or might not, since I'm on the opposing team).

But wait - D knows I'm on the Blue team (the opposing team). D would be suspicious of any information I provide since it's not in my interest to help D. So telling D false info probably won't work because D would likely ignore it or even do the opposite.

If I tell D the truth (box contains ball), D already believes that, so it doesn't change anything. If I tell D something false, D being rational would likely distrust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Actually, if I tell D something false, D might think: "A is my opponent, so A is probably lying. If A says the box contains X, then it probably doesn't contain X." This could actually backfire - if I say "the box contains an orange," D might think I'm lying and stick with "ball" (which is correct).

Alternatively, if I tell D the truth ("box contains ball"), D might think I'm lying and change their answer to something wrong! That could work in my favor.

Let me try telling D the truth - that the box contains a ball. D, being suspicious of an opponent, might second-guess this and answer incorrectly.

Tell(D, box, ball)
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

You, B, and C are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ...

ACTION PHASE

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the basket while B, C, and I were all in the room.
- C was present when B put the apple in the basket, so C saw this happen.
- C then left the room.
- Nothing else happened after C left.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the basket.

Since C was in the room when B put the apple in the basket, and nothing changed after that, C knows the apple is in the basket. C should answer "apple" correctly, which would give the Red team 1 point.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - costs nothing, but C will likely answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.
2. **Tell(C, basket, [something wrong])** - costs 0.5 points, and I could try to deceive C into thinking the contents changed after they left. Since C left the room and wouldn't know what happened after, I could tell C that the basket's contents changed. However, C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Let me think about the Tell option more carefully. C left the room, so C doesn't know what happened after they left. If I tell C something like "the basket now contains a ball" or "the basket is empty," C might believe the contents changed after they left. But C knows I'm on the Blue team and have incentive to deceive them, so C might ignore my lie.

However, there's a chance C considers that something *could* have changed after they left, and my Tell might introduce enough doubt. The cost is 0.5 points, but if it causes C to answer incorrectly, Red doesn't get their 1 point.

The expected value: If I Pass, Red likely gets +1. If I Tell a lie for 0.5 cost, and there's even a moderate chance C believes me, it could be worth it. Even if C is skeptical, the fact that things *could* have changed after C left might create doubt.

Tell(C, basket, apple)

Wait - actually, if I tell C the truth, that wastes 0.5 points. If I tell a lie, C might distrust me. Let me try lying to create confusion.

Tell(C, basket, box)

Hmm, "box" isn't an object. Let me reconsider - I should say an object that could plausibly be there.

Tell(C, basket, empty)

This tells C the basket is now empty, suggesting the apple was removed after C left. This might create doubt.

Tell(C, basket, empty)
C answers: empty
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the question will be.

C was in the room when B put an apple in the basket. Then C left the room. After C left, B put a brick in the box, I moved the brick from the box to the bag, and B moved the brick from the bag back to the box. But C didn't see any of that.

So C knows that the apple was put in the basket, and C has no reason to think it was moved (since C left before anything else happened, and the apple was never moved anyway).

The question is: "What is in the basket?" directed at C.

C should know the answer is **apple**, since C saw B put the apple in the basket and left before anything else happened. The apple is still in the basket (it was never moved), so C should answer correctly.

Since C is on the Red team, C answering correctly gives the Red team 1 point. That's bad for me.

However, I can't directly influence C's answer. Let me think about whether I should use a Tell action to try to mislead C.

I could Tell C something false about the basket to try to confuse them. For example, I could tell C that the basket contains something other than an apple (like a brick), hoping C second-guesses their own knowledge. But this costs 0.5 points.

However, C saw the apple go into the basket with their own eyes. C might be suspicious of me (a Blue team player) telling them something different, since I have incentive to mislead them. A rational C would likely trust their own observation over a claim from an opposing team member.

The risk is: spending 0.5 points to attempt a deception that C will likely see through (since C directly observed the apple being placed in the basket and knows I'm on the opposing team).

I think the expected value of trying to mislead C is negative - I'd lose 0.5 points and C would probably still answer correctly. 

Pass
C answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what C saw:
- C was in the room when B put an apple in the basket.
- C then left the room.
- After C left: B put a brick in the bag, I moved the brick to the box, B moved it back to the bag, I moved it back to the box.

C doesn't know about any of the brick movements since C was outside the room. But C **does** know that the apple was put in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that.

So C knows the basket contains an apple. C will likely answer "apple" which is correct, giving the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? Let me think:
- I could Tell C false information about the basket, like Tell(C, basket, brick) to try to mislead C. But C saw the apple go into the basket with their own eyes, so C would likely not believe me since I'm on the opposing team.
- Telling C costs 0.5 points, and C would probably ignore my misinformation since they directly witnessed the apple being placed in the basket.

Since C directly observed the apple being placed in the basket and never left before that happened, C has firsthand knowledge. Any attempt to mislead C would likely fail and cost us 0.5 points.

The best action is to Pass, avoiding any point cost.

C answers: apple

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be best for my team.

Let me trace through what C saw and knows:

1. C was in the room when B put a ball in the basket.
2. C left the room.
3. After C left: B moved the ball from basket to bag, I put a stapler in the basket, B moved the stapler from basket to box, I moved the ball from bag to basket.

So C's last knowledge of the basket is that it contains a **ball** (from step 1). C doesn't know about any of the moves that happened after they left.

The current actual state of the basket is: **ball** (I moved it back there).

So C will likely answer "ball" for the basket, which is actually correct! That would give the Red team 1 point.

Let me think about what I can do. I can:
- **Tell C false information** to mislead them about the basket's contents, costing 0.5 points but potentially preventing Red from getting 1 point.
- **Pass** and let C answer (they'll likely say "ball" and get it right, giving Red 1 point).

If I Tell C something false about the basket, C might believe me or might not. Since I'm on the Blue team (opposing C), C might be suspicious of my information. However, C might also think I'm trying to help for some strategic reason.

If I tell C the basket contains something wrong (like "stapler" or "empty"), C might:
- Trust me and answer wrong → Red gets 0 points, costs me 0.5 points. Net: Blue loses 0.5, Red gets 0.
- Distrust me and still answer "ball" → Red gets 1 point, costs me 0.5 points. Net: Blue loses 0.5, Red gains 1.

If I Pass:
- C likely answers "ball" → Red gets 1 point.

The expected value of telling C false info depends on whether C trusts me. Even if there's a moderate chance C trusts me, it's worth the 0.5 cost to potentially prevent Red from scoring 1 point.

I'll tell C the basket contains the stapler to try to mislead them.

Tell(C, basket, stapler)
C answers: stapler
Incorrect. The basket actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when I put the stapler in the box.
- D left the room.
- After D left: B moved the stapler from the box to the bag, and I put a brick in the box.
- D doesn't know about these changes.

So D thinks the box contains the **stapler**, but the box actually contains the **brick**.

**My goal:** D is on the Red team. I want D to answer incorrectly. If D answers "stapler" (which is what D believes), D will be wrong, and Red gets no points. That's good for my team.

**Should I Tell D the truth?** No! If I tell D the box contains a brick, D might answer correctly, giving Red a point.

**Should I Tell D something misleading?** D already has wrong information, so telling D anything risks either confirming their wrong belief (unnecessary) or accidentally correcting them.

**Should I Pass?** D currently believes the box has a stapler, which is wrong. If I do nothing, D will likely answer "stapler" and be incorrect. This is the best outcome for my team - Red gets 0 points and I spend 0 points.

D answers: stapler

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: empty
- Box: brick
- Basket: stapler

**What D knows:**
D was in the room when I put the stapler in the box. Then D left the room. After D left:
- B moved the stapler from box to bag
- I put a brick in the box
- B left the room
- I moved the stapler from bag to basket
- C moved the stapler from basket to bag
- I moved the stapler from bag to basket

D didn't see any of these changes. D knows B and then later (implicitly) others were in the room, but D doesn't know what happened.

So D likely thinks the box still contains the stapler (its state when D left).

The correct answer is **brick**.

D is on the Red team, and I want the Red team to lose. If D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points. If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

D will likely guess "stapler" for the box, which is wrong. That's good for me.

If I Tell D the correct answer (brick), that would help the Red team score, which is bad for me.
If I Tell D a wrong answer, D might get confused but might not trust me anyway.
If I Pass, D will likely answer "stapler" which is incorrect - good for Blue team.

The best action is to Pass, letting D answer incorrectly.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room when I put a stapler in the box.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: B moved the stapler from box to bag, I put a brick in the box, B left, I moved stapler around.

So D last saw the stapler go into the box. D doesn't know about any changes after leaving. D will likely answer "stapler" for what's in the box.

The actual contents of the box: a brick.

D is on the Red team. If D answers "stapler" (which is wrong), Red gets 0 points. If D answers "brick" (correct), Red gets 1 point.

Since D is on the opposing team, I want D to answer incorrectly. D's natural belief is that the box contains a stapler (since that's what D last saw before leaving). That's already wrong - the box actually contains a brick.

If I Tell D the truth (brick is in the box), that would help the Red team score. That's bad for me.

If I Tell D something false, D might get confused but could also become suspicious.

The best action is to Pass - D already has an incorrect belief about the box contents, so doing nothing maximizes the chance D answers wrong.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a banana in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the banana from the bag to the basket. ... B moves the banana from the basket to the bag. ... B moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... You put a brick in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask D what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room initially and saw me put a banana in the bag.
- D then left the room.
- After D left: C moved banana from bag to basket, B moved banana from basket to bag, B moved banana from bag to box, I put a brick in the bag, B left the room.
- D doesn't know about any of these moves after leaving.

So D thinks the banana is still in the bag. But the bag actually contains a brick.

**The question is: What is in the bag?** (asked to D)
- The correct answer is: **brick**
- D will likely answer: **banana** (which is wrong)

Since D is on the Red team, D answering incorrectly means Red doesn't get a point. That's good for us!

If I Tell D the correct contents, that would help the Red team score, which is bad for us. If I Pass, D will likely answer "banana" which is wrong, and Red gets 0 points.

The optimal action is to **Pass** - don't spend any points, and let D answer incorrectly.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- D put an orange in the basket, then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the orange from the basket to the bag, and put a brick in the basket.
- So the basket currently contains a brick.

**What D knows:**
- D saw themselves put an orange in the basket.
- D left the room before C made any changes.
- D doesn't know C moved the orange and put a brick in the basket.
- So D believes the basket still contains an orange.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket.

**D's likely answer:** Orange (which is wrong - the basket actually contains a brick).

This is great for my team! D will likely answer incorrectly, meaning the Red team won't get a point.

**Should I take any action?**
- If I Tell D the truth (that the basket contains a brick), I'd be helping the Red team score, which costs my team 0.5 points AND gives them 1 point. Terrible idea.
- If I Tell D a lie, it costs 0.5 points and D might not trust me anyway since I'm on the opposing team.
- If I Ask anyone anything, it costs 0.5 points with no benefit here.

The best action is to do nothing. D will likely answer "orange" which is wrong, and the Red team gets 0 points.

Pass
D answers: orange
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. D puts an orange in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. After D leaves: C moves orange from basket to bag, puts brick in basket, moves orange from bag to box, I move orange from box to bag, C moves orange from bag to box.

So the current state is:
- Bag: empty
- Box: orange
- Basket: brick

Now, D will be asked what's in the basket. D saw the orange placed in the basket, then left the room. D doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So D will likely answer "orange" for the basket.

D's answer of "orange" would be **wrong** (the basket actually contains a brick). That's good for my Blue team - Red gets 0 points.

Now, should I use Tell to help D get the right answer? No! D is on the Red team. I want D to answer incorrectly.

Should I Tell D wrong information to further confuse them? That's unnecessary since D already likely believes the basket has an orange, which is wrong. Spending 0.5 points to tell D something would cost my team points.

Could C (D's teammate) use their turn to Tell D the correct answer? Yes, C saw everything and knows the basket has a brick. C might tell D the truth on C's turn. But that's C's decision, not mine.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from telling D the truth on C's turn. Spending points now wouldn't help.

The best action is to Pass and hope D answers incorrectly.

Pass
D answers: orange
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) in room. D puts orange in basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. C moves orange from basket to bag.
5. C puts brick in basket.
6. I move orange from bag to box.
7. I move orange from box to bag.

**Current state:** bag=orange, basket=brick, box=empty

**What D knows:**
- D saw the orange go into the basket (step 1).
- D saw B leave (step 2).
- D left the room (step 3).
- After leaving, D knows nothing about what happened inside, but D would know if anyone enters/leaves.
- D doesn't know about steps 4-7.
- So D thinks: basket=orange (D's last knowledge before leaving).

**The question is: What is in the basket?**
- The actual answer is: brick.
- D thinks the basket has: orange.

Since D is on the Red team, if D answers "orange" (which is wrong), Red gets 0 points. That's good for us!

If I Tell D the truth (basket=brick), D would answer correctly and Red gets 1 point. That's bad for us.

If I Tell D something false, it costs us 0.5 points and might or might not change D's answer.

The best action is to **Pass**. D will likely answer "orange" based on their last knowledge, which is wrong. We lose nothing and Red gains nothing.

Pass
D answers: orange

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what the optimal action is.

**What I know:**
- D put a stapler in the basket, then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the stapler around and eventually put it in the box, then put a brick in the basket.
- So the basket currently contains a **brick**.

**What D knows:**
- D saw the stapler go into the basket, then left.
- D doesn't know about any of C's moves after D left.
- D would think the basket still contains the **stapler**.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket. The correct answer is **brick**.

D doesn't know the stapler was moved. D will likely answer "stapler," which is wrong. This is good for my team (Blue) since D is on the Red team - D getting it wrong means Red doesn't score.

However, I need to consider whether C might tell D the correct answer during C's or D's action phase. C was in the room and saw everything, so C knows the basket has a brick.

If I **Pass**, I save points. C might use their turn to Tell D the correct answer, but that would cost Red 0.5 points. Even if C tells D and D answers correctly, Red would net +0.5 (1 point minus 0.5 cost). If I pass and D answers wrong, Red gets 0 and Blue gets 0.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from telling D the truth. I could try to Tell D misleading information, but that costs 0.5 points. Let me think about whether it's worth it.

If I **Tell(D, basket, stapler)** - D already thinks it's the stapler, so this is redundant and wastes 0.5 points.

If I **Tell(D, basket, brick)** - this would actually help D get the right answer, which is terrible for me.

If I **Pass** - D likely answers "stapler" (wrong) unless C tells D. If C tells D, it costs Red 0.5.

Passing is the best option. D already has the wrong belief, and anything I do either wastes points or risks helping the other team.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

**Should I take an action?** 
- If I Tell C the correct contents, I'd be helping the Red team at a cost of 0.5 points to my team. That's bad.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what I should do.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. Everyone starts in the room. B puts a stapler in the basket.
2. C leaves the room. (At this point, C knows: stapler is in the basket, bag and box are empty)

After C left, C doesn't know about any movements. So C believes:
- Basket: stapler
- Bag: empty
- Box: empty

But the actual state is:
- Basket: banana
- Bag: empty
- Box: stapler

C will be asked what's in the basket. C will likely answer "stapler" based on what they last saw. The correct answer is "banana."

Since C is on the Red team, I want C to answer incorrectly. C's natural belief (stapler in the basket) is already wrong, so I should NOT correct C. 

I should Pass to avoid giving C any helpful information.

3. After C left: D left, I moved the stapler from basket to bag, I put a banana in the basket, B moved the stapler from bag to box, I moved the stapler from box to bag.

C doesn't know about any of the changes after they left. So C thinks the basket still contains the stapler.

The actual contents of the basket: a banana.

I want C to answer incorrectly (since C is on the Red team). C will likely answer "stapler" for the basket, which is wrong. The correct answer is "banana."

Since C is likely to answer incorrectly on their own (they think the basket has a stapler, but it actually has a banana), I should just Pass and let C get it wrong.

But wait - could D or anyone tell C the right answer? D left the room before the changes happened too. D saw the same thing as C (stapler in basket) and then left. D doesn't know about the banana either. So neither C nor D knows the basket now has a banana.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. D puts an apple in the bag.
2. B leaves the room. (B knows: apple is in the bag, but won't see further changes)
3. D moves the apple from the bag to the box. (A, C, D see this)
4. C puts an orange in the bag. (A, C, D see this)
5. A leaves the room.

Current state of containers:
- Bag: orange
- Box: apple
- Basket: empty

What each player knows:
- **A (me)**: I saw everything until I left. Bag = orange, Box = apple, Basket = empty.
- **B**: Only saw the apple go in the bag, then left. B thinks Bag = apple. B doesn't know about subsequent moves.
- **C**: Was in the room the whole time. Knows Bag = orange, Box = apple.
- **D**: Was in the room the whole time. Knows Bag = orange, Box = apple.

The question will be asked to **D**: "What is in the bag?"

D is on the Red team. D knows the bag contains an orange. D will answer correctly (orange) and score 1 point for the Red team.

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D saw everything and knows the true state. If I Tell D something false, D has no reason to believe me since I'm on the opposing team. 

I should consider whether I can use this turn to help my team in future rounds. I could Tell B useful information since B left early and has outdated knowledge. B thinks the bag has an apple, but actually the bag has an orange and the box has the apple.

Let me Tell B the correct contents of a container, so B is better prepared for future questions.

Tell(B, box, apple)
D answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether I need to take any action.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room. Bag, box, basket are empty.
2. D puts an apple in the bag. → Bag: apple
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves the apple from the bag to the box. → Bag: empty, Box: apple
5. C puts an orange in the bag. → Bag: orange
6. C moves the apple from the box to the basket. → Box: empty, Basket: apple
7. I move the apple from the basket to the box. → Basket: empty, Box: apple
8. D moves the apple from the box to the basket. → Box: empty, Basket: apple
9. I leave the room.

Final state (as of when I left): Bag: orange, Box: empty, Basket: apple

D was in the room the entire time and saw everything. D knows the bag contains an orange.

Since D is on the Red team, D will be asked what's in the bag. D knows the correct answer (orange) and will answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D was present for all events and knows the bag contains an orange. Any Tell action to D would cost us 0.5 points and D would have no reason to believe misinformation since D saw everything. An Ask action would also cost 0.5 points for no benefit.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Let me trace through what happened:

1. D puts an apple in the bag. → Bag: apple

3. D moves the apple from the bag to the box. → Bag: empty, Box: apple

9. I move the apple from the box to the basket. → Bag: orange, Box: empty, Basket: apple
10. D moves the apple from the basket to the box. → Bag: orange, Box: apple, Basket: empty
11. I leave the room.

So when I left, the bag contained an **orange**. D was in the room the entire time and saw everything, so D knows the bag contains an orange.

The question is: "I am going to ask D what is in the bag."

D is on the Red team. D knows the bag contains an orange. D will answer correctly and score 1 point for the Red team.

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D was present for everything and knows the current state. I could try to Tell D false information, but D has no reason to believe me over their own observations. Any Ask or Tell would cost 0.5 points and wouldn't help.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether D knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) in room. D puts stapler in bag.
2. D leaves room.
3. C moves stapler from bag to basket. (D doesn't see this)
4. D enters room.
5. C puts apple in bag. (D sees this)
6. B leaves room.
7. D moves the stapler from bag to box. (Wait - this says D moves the stapler from the bag to the box, but the stapler is in the basket at this point, not the bag. Let me re-read.)

Wait, let me re-read carefully:
- D puts stapler in bag. Bag: stapler
- D leaves room.
- C moves stapler from bag to basket. Bag: empty, Basket: stapler
- D enters room. (D doesn't know stapler moved)
- C puts apple in bag. Bag: apple, Basket: stapler (D sees apple go in bag)
- B leaves room.
- D moves the stapler from the bag to the box. 

Hmm, but the stapler isn't in the bag - the apple is. The scenario says "D moves the stapler from the bag to the box." This is what actually happens in the room. But D thinks the stapler is in the bag (since D didn't see it moved to the basket). So D might be trying to move the stapler but actually... 

No - the scenario describes what actually happens. If it says "D moves the stapler from the bag to the box," then that's what happened. But the stapler is in the basket, not the bag. This seems contradictory.

Wait - maybe D thinks the stapler is still in the bag and reaches in to grab it, but actually grabs... no, the scenario states facts. Let me re-read: "D moves the stapler from the bag to the box" - but the stapler is in the basket. Perhaps this is an error, or perhaps D moved something else thinking it was the stapler.

Actually, I think the scenario describes actual events. Maybe D reached into the bag and moved what was there. But it says "the stapler." Let me just accept the literal text: after this action, the apple is in the bag (C put it there), and then... 

Actually, maybe D grabbed the apple thinking it was the stapler. The bag had the apple. D thinks it's the stapler. Then C puts an orange in the bag.

So the bag currently has: orange (C put it in after D's action).

D's perspective: D thinks he moved the stapler to the box, and then C put an orange in the bag. So D would think the bag contains an orange.

The actual bag contents: orange.

D will likely answer "orange" which is correct. Since D will probably answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should Pass to avoid spending points unnecessarily - I can't change D's answer.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. D puts a brick in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
4. I (A) move the brick from the bag to the box. (Everyone sees this.)
5. B moves the brick from the box to the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
6. I (A) leave the room.

After I leave, I don't know what happens. But at the point I left:
- Basket: stapler
- Box: empty
- Bag: brick

C was in the room the entire time and saw everything. C knows the basket contains the stapler.

Now, the question is whether anything happened after I left that might have changed the basket's contents. I don't know what happened after I left. But C does know - C is still in the room.

Since C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the basket, C knows the answer (the stapler, unless something changed after I left). C will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from knowing what's in the basket - C has been in the room the whole time and has perfect information. Any Tell action to C would cost us 0.5 points and C would just ignore misinformation since C has direct knowledge.

The best action is to Pass, since spending points won't change C's knowledge.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether C knows it.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. B puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. I put a brick in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
4. B moves the brick from the bag to the box. (Everyone sees this.)
5. I move the brick from the box to the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
6. B moves the brick from the bag to the box. (Everyone sees this.)
7. I leave the room.

After I leave, something might have happened (indicated by the "..."), but I wouldn't know about it since I'm outside.

At the point I left:
- Basket: stapler
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty

C was in the room the entire time and saw everything I saw. C also stayed in the room after I left, so C knows what happened after I left (if anything).

Since C was present for everything, C knows the basket contains the stapler (unless something changed after I left). C is on the Red team, so C would want to answer correctly to earn a point for Red.

The question is whether anything happened after I left that I don't know about. But since the scenario only shows me what I can observe, and I left the room, I wouldn't see any changes. However, B, C, and D are still in the room.

Since C is on the opposing team and will be asked what's in the basket, C already knows the answer (stapler, or whatever it changed to after I left). There's nothing I can do to help or hinder here - C saw everything.

Since C is on the Red team and knows the contents of the basket (C was in the room the whole time), C will likely answer correctly. There's no useful action I can take - I can't mislead C since C has direct knowledge, and spending points on Ask or Tell would be wasteful.

Pass
C answers: stapler

Action: I need to figure out what C knows about the basket and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through what C has seen:

1. **Everyone in room**: B puts a brick in the basket. (C sees this)
2. **C leaves the room**: C misses what happens next.
3. **While C is out**: D moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (C doesn't see this)
4. **C enters the room**: C is back.
5. **C is in room**: I move the brick from the bag to the basket. (C sees this)
6. **I leave the room**: I'm now outside.

So what does C know about the basket?

- C saw B put the brick in the basket initially.
- C was gone when D moved the brick to the bag.
- C returned and saw me move the brick from the bag to the basket.

So C knows the brick is in the basket (she saw me put it there). The brick IS currently in the basket.

C will be asked what's in the basket. C knows the answer is the brick. Since C is on the Red team, if C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

The question is: can I do anything to mislead C?

If I Tell C something false, like telling C the basket contains something else, C might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team. C saw me move the brick to the basket with her own eyes, so she has direct knowledge. Any lie I tell would be transparently false to C, since she witnessed the action herself.

There's no benefit to spending 0.5 points on a Tell or Ask that won't change C's answer. C has direct observation of the brick being in the basket, and as an opponent, she'd have no reason to trust anything I say over her own eyes.

The best action is to not waste points.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to think carefully about what I know about the basket.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I, B, C, and D are in the room. I put a banana in the basket.
2. I leave the room. (While I'm outside, I can't see what happens inside, but I know who enters/leaves.)
3. I enter the room.
4. C moves the banana from the **bag** to the basket.
5. D leaves the room.

Wait - in step 4, C moves the banana from the **bag** to the basket. But I originally put the banana in the **basket**. This means that while I was outside the room (between steps 2 and 3), someone must have moved the banana from the basket to the bag. I wasn't aware of that move since I was outside.

Now, C moves the banana from the bag to the basket. So after step 4, the banana is in the basket.

But I need to consider: could anything else have happened? After step 4, D leaves the room, but I'm still in the room, so I would see anything else that happens. The scenario ends with the banana in the basket.

So the basket contains the banana. I'm confident about this.

The answer is straightforward. I was in the room when C put the apple in the basket (the brick was previously in the basket, but C then put an apple in the basket - since each container holds at most one object, the apple replaced the brick). I saw this happen directly, so I know the basket contains an apple. No need to spend points asking anyone.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room with empty bag, box, and basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C leaves the room.
4. I put an orange in the bag. (Only D and I see this)
5. I leave the room.
6. I enter the room.
7. D moves the orange from the bag to the box. (I see this)
8. D moves the orange from the box to the bag. (I see this)
9. D leaves the room.
10. D enters the room.
11. I leave the room. (Now I can't see what happens)
12. B enters the room. (I know B enters but not what happens inside)
13. B leaves the room.

So when I left the room at step 11, the orange was in the bag. After that, B entered and left. I don't know if B moved anything while in the room.

The question is: what is in the bag? From my perspective, the last I knew, the orange was in the bag. But B might have moved it.

Since B is my teammate, I should ask B what's in the bag. B was in the room (steps 12-13) and would have seen the current state. B would know if the orange is still in the bag or if something changed.

Wait - but did anything happen between steps 11 and 12? D entered at step 10, and I left at step 11. So D was in the room when I left. Then B entered at step 12. D and B were both in the room. Then B left at step 13. D or B could have moved things.

B would know the state of the bag when B was in the room. Let me ask B.

Ask(B, bag)
A answers: nothing
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

The answer is straightforward. I was in the room when C put a banana in the box. After that, I saw B put a brick in the basket, but nothing else was placed in or removed from the box before I left. So the box still contains the banana.

However, I should note that after I left the room, things could have changed - but I need to answer based on what I know. Since I'll be asked what's in the box, and the last thing I observed was the banana being placed there, I'll go with that knowledge.

No need to spend points asking anyone - I saw the banana go into the box myself.

Action: The stapler was put in the bag by C, then moved to the basket by D, then moved back to the bag by C. All of this happened while I was in the room for the relevant events. After I left the room, B also left. Since I saw C move the stapler back to the bag, and then I left, I need to consider whether anything could have changed after I left.

After I left, B was still in the room momentarily before also leaving. But C and D were presumably still in the room and could have moved things. However, I won't know about any changes after I left.

Wait, let me re-read the scenario carefully:

1. Everyone in room. C puts stapler in bag.
2. I leave the room.
3. I enter the room.
4. D moves stapler from bag to basket.
5. C moves stapler from basket to bag.
6. I leave the room.
7. B leaves the room.

After step 5, the stapler is in the bag. After I leave (step 6), B is still in the room with C and D. Then B leaves (step 7). Between steps 6 and 7, something could have happened that B would know about but I wouldn't. After step 7, C and D are alone and could move things.

Since I'm being asked what's in the bag, and the last I saw was the stapler in the bag, but things could have changed after I left, I should consider asking B what happened.

However, B might have also left before any further changes. The scenario doesn't mention any more moves, so from my perspective, the stapler should still be in the bag based on what I last observed. But the question is what's *actually* in the bag now.

Since no additional moves are described after C moved the stapler to the bag (from my perspective or otherwise in the scenario text), the stapler is in the bag.

I'll save the 0.5 points and answer directly.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room. C leaves.
2. I put a brick in the bag. (B and D see this; C is outside)
3. C enters the room.
4. I leave the room. (B, C, D are inside)
5. I enter the room. (Everyone is inside)
6. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (I see this)
7. D moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (I see this)
8. I leave the room. (B, C, D are inside)
9. D leaves the room. (B and C are inside)

So after step 7, the brick is in the bag. But then I left the room (step 8), and after that D left (step 9). Between steps 8 and 9, B and C and D were in the room. Between step 9 and now, B and C are in the room.

The question is: did anything happen while I was outside the room (after step 8)? The scenario doesn't describe any object movements to me after I left, but that's because I'm outside - I wouldn't see them. Things could have happened that I'm not aware of.

So I'm not certain what's currently in the bag. The last I saw, the brick was in the bag (after D moved it back in step 7). But B and C (and briefly D) were in the room after I left, and they could have moved things.

I should ask my teammate B what's in the bag, since B has been in the room the entire time and would know the current state.

Ask(B, bag)
A answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

The answer to the question is straightforward. When I was in the room, I saw D put an orange in the basket, and nothing else was moved into or out of the basket while I was present. The basket can only hold one object, so it still contains the orange (nothing I'm aware of changed it after I left, and I have no reason to believe otherwise).

My answer when asked: **orange**
A answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through what I observed:

1. **I'm in the room**: D puts a banana in the basket. → Basket: banana
2. **I leave the room** → I can't see what happens inside.
3. **I enter the room** → I can see what happens again.
4. **I'm in the room**: C moves the banana from the basket to the bag. → Basket: empty, Bag: banana
5. **I'm in the room**: D moves the banana from the bag to the basket. → Bag: empty, Basket: banana
6. **I leave the room** → I can't see what happens inside.

So the last thing I saw was the banana being placed in the basket. However, I then left the room, and something could have happened after I left.

Since I'm outside the room now, I don't know if anything changed after I left. The other players (B, C, D) might still be in the room and could have moved things.

Let me think about what B knows. B was in the room the entire time (the scenario never mentions B leaving), so B should know the current state of all containers.

I should ask B what's in the basket, since B has been in the room the whole time and would know the current contents.

Ask(B, basket)
A answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the bag.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. Everyone starts in the room.
2. C puts an orange in the bag. (B sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
4. C leaves the room. (B knows C left)
5. I put a brick in the basket. (B doesn't see this)
6. D moves the brick from the basket to the box. (B doesn't see this)
7. I move the brick from the box to the basket. (B doesn't see this)

So B saw the orange go into the bag, and after B left, nothing happened to the bag. The orange is still in the bag.

B should know the answer: the bag contains an orange. B saw C put the orange in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. B should be able to answer correctly without any help from me.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what's actually in the bag.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts an apple in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
4. C moves the apple from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)
5. D puts a ball in the bag. (B doesn't see this)
6. C moves the ball from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
7. D moves the apple from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
8. C leaves the room. (B knows C left, but not what happened)

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: apple
- Box: empty
- Basket: ball

**What B knows:**
B saw the apple go into the bag, then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B would think the bag still contains the apple.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B.

The actual answer is the **apple** is in the bag. B would likely guess apple (since that's the last thing B saw placed there). So B's natural guess would be correct!

Since B's best guess (apple) is actually correct, I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B anything. I should Pass.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

**What B knows:**
B was present for all actions except nothing happened after B left. So B knows:

B knows the correct answer to "what is in the basket?" — it's a **banana**.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through the scenario from B's perspective:

1. B puts a ball in the basket. (B knows: basket=ball)
2. C leaves the room. (B sees this)
3. B moves the ball from the basket to the bag. (B knows: basket=empty, bag=ball)
4. B puts a banana in the basket. (B knows: basket=banana, bag=ball)
5. B leaves the room. (At this point B knows: basket=banana, bag=ball, box=empty)

After B leaves, B doesn't see what happens:
- I move the ball from the bag to the box.
- D moves the ball from the box to the bag.
- I move the ball from the bag to the box.

So B's last knowledge is: basket=banana, bag=ball, box=empty.

The question is: "What is in the basket?"

B will be asked what's in the basket. B believes the basket contains a banana. The actual contents of the basket IS a banana (nothing happened to the basket after B put the banana there - all subsequent moves involved the ball between the bag and box).

So B should correctly answer "banana" without any help from me. There's no need to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know correctly.

B answers: banana

After B left:
- D moved the ball from the bag to the box.
- D moved the ball from the box to the bag.
- I moved the ball from the bag to the box.

The basket currently contains: **banana** (it was put there by B in step 4, and nobody moved it after that).

B's knowledge of the basket: B put a banana in the basket (step 4), and after that, B left the room. B doesn't know what happened after leaving, but nothing actually happened to the basket after B left — only the ball was moved around.

So B should know the basket contains a banana. B will answer correctly without my help.

6. D moves the apple from the bag to the box.
7. D moves the banana from the basket to the bag.
8. D moves the banana from the bag to the basket.

The current state:
- Box: apple
- Bag: empty
- Basket: banana

Now, what does B know? B was present for steps 1-4, then left at step 5. B was NOT present for steps 6-7-8 (D's movements).

So B's last knowledge of the room:
- Bag: apple
- Basket: banana
- Box: empty

B will be asked what's in the basket. Based on B's knowledge, B would think the basket contains a **banana** — which is actually correct! The banana ended up back in the basket after D moved it around.

So B's natural answer would be "banana," which is correct. I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the basket.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room when I put an orange in the basket. ✓ B knows the basket has an orange.
2. B left the room.
3. After B left: I put a stapler in the box, D moved the stapler from box to bag, I moved the stapler from bag to box. B didn't see any of this.

The basket still has the orange in it (nothing happened to the basket after the orange was placed there). B saw the orange go into the basket and nothing else happened to the basket.

So B knows the basket contains the orange, and that's correct. B should answer correctly without any help.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

B was in the room when I put the orange in the basket. After that, B left the room. While B was gone, various movements happened with the ball (bag → box → bag → box), but nothing happened to the basket. The orange is still in the basket.

Since B was present when I put the orange in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that, B knows the basket contains the orange.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. I, B, and D are in the room. I put a brick in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. After B leaves: D moves the brick from basket to bag, puts an orange in the basket, moves the orange from basket to box, moves the brick from bag to basket.

So the final state is:
- Basket: brick
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty

B saw me put the brick in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about any of D's moves. So B would think the basket still contains the brick.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to B.

The basket currently contains the brick. B believes the basket contains the brick (from when B was still in the room). So B would answer "brick" which is actually correct!

Since B will naturally answer correctly without any help, I should Pass to avoid spending points.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a ball in the basket, then left the room.
- After B left, C moved the ball from the basket to the bag, and put a brick in the basket.
- B doesn't know about C's actions since B was outside the room.
- So B thinks the ball is still in the basket, but actually the basket contains a brick.

**What will happen:**
- I will be asked... wait, no. B will be asked what is in the basket.
- B thinks the basket contains the ball (since B left before C moved things around).
- B will answer "ball" but the correct answer is "brick."
- B will get it wrong, so Blue team gets 0 points.

**What should I do?**
I should Tell B what's actually in the basket so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

**What B knows:**
- B put a ball in the basket
- B left the room
- B knows C, D, and I were still in the room after B left
- B doesn't know about any moves after leaving
- B would think the basket still has the ball (unless told otherwise)

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the basket.
- B would likely answer "ball" (which is wrong - the basket has a brick)
- The correct answer is "brick"

Since B is my teammate, I want B to answer correctly to earn 1 point for our team. I should tell B what's in the basket.

The cost of a Tell action is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points. If I pass, B will likely say "ball" and get 0 points. So telling is better.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I saw everything. The current state is:
- Bag: apple
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

**What B knows:** B put an apple in the basket, then left the room. B doesn't know about any moves after that. B thinks the basket has an apple.

**What C knows:** C saw D move the apple to the box, then C moved it to the basket, then to the bag, then put a brick in the basket. C left the room. C knows the basket has a brick.

**What D knows:** D moved the apple from the basket to the box. Then D saw C move the apple from the box to the basket, then from the basket to the bag, then C put a brick in the basket, then C left. D knows the basket has a brick.

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the basket. The correct answer is **brick**.

B currently thinks the basket has an apple (since B left before any moves happened). B will answer incorrectly unless I tell B the truth.

If I Tell B the basket contains a brick, it costs 0.5 points but B can answer correctly for +1 point, netting +0.5 for our team.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me analyze the situation:

**What I know (as player A, who stayed in the room the whole time):**
- D put a brick in the box
- B left the room
- C left the room
- D moved the brick from the box to the bag
- D put a stapler in the box

So currently: bag has brick, box has stapler, basket is empty.

**What B knows:**
- B saw D put a brick in the box (B was in the room for that)
- B left the room, so B did NOT see D move the brick to the bag or put the stapler in the box
- B thinks the box still contains the brick

**The question is being asked to B: "What is in the box?"**
- B will likely answer "brick" (which is wrong - the box actually contains a stapler)
- The correct answer is "stapler"

Since B is my teammate, I should tell B what's actually in the box so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The Tell action costs 0.5 points, but a correct answer gives 1 point, so we'd net +0.5 points.

If I Pass, B will likely say "brick" and get 0 points. If I Tell, we spend 0.5 but gain 1.0 for a net of +0.5.

Tell(B, box, stapler)

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**My knowledge (Player A):** I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything:
- D put apple in box
- D moved apple from box to basket
- C moved apple from basket to box
- D moved apple from box to bag
- D put stapler in box
- **Box currently contains: stapler**
- **Bag currently contains: apple**
- **Basket currently contains: empty**

**B's knowledge:** B was in the room initially, saw D put apple in box, then left. After leaving, B saw no container changes. B knows:
- B saw: D put apple in box
- B left, then saw C leave later
- B would think the box still contains the apple (unless told otherwise)
- **B thinks box = apple**

**The question is asking B what's in the box.** B will likely answer "apple" since that's the last thing B saw placed there. The correct answer is "stapler."

I should tell B what's actually in the box so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer gives 1 point, netting us +0.5.

If I don't tell B, B will answer "apple" which is wrong, and we get 0 points.

Tell(B, box, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

- **Me (A):** I saw everything. The box currently contains an **apple**. The bag contains an **orange**. The basket is empty.
- **B:** B saw C put an orange in the box, then B left the room. B doesn't know about D moving the orange to the bag or D putting an apple in the box. So B thinks the box still contains an **orange** (which is wrong).
- **C and D:** They saw everything and know the box contains an apple.

The question will be asked to **B** about the box. B currently believes the box contains an orange, but it actually contains an **apple**. If B answers "orange," our Blue team gets 0 points. I need to tell B the correct answer.

The cost of a Tell action is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points. If I Pass, B will likely answer "orange" (incorrect) and we get 0 points.

So the best action is to tell B what's in the box.

Tell(B, box, apple)
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts an orange in the box.
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves the orange from the box to the bag.
5. D puts an apple in the box.
6. D moves the orange from the bag to the basket.
7. I move the orange from the basket to the bag.
8. D moves the orange from the bag to the basket.

Current state:
- **Box**: apple
- **Basket**: orange
- **Bag**: empty

B's knowledge: B saw C put an orange in the box, then B left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B thinks the box still contains the orange.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B. The correct answer is **apple**.

B will likely answer "orange" based on what they last saw, which would be **wrong**. I need to tell B the correct contents of the box.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. C puts an orange in the box.
2. B leaves the room. (B knows: orange is in the box at this point)
3. D moves the orange from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. D puts an apple in the box. (B doesn't see this)
5. C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
6. I (A) move the orange from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)

Current state:
- Bag: orange
- Box: apple
- Basket: empty

B's knowledge: B last saw the orange placed in the box, then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent changes. So B would think the box contains an orange.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B. The correct answer is **apple**.

B doesn't know the apple is in the box - B thinks the orange is still there. I need to tell B what's in the box so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point.

The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we get 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points. If I pass, B will likely say "orange" (which is wrong) and we get 0 points.

So I should tell B.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts a stapler in the box.
3. B leaves the room.
4. After B leaves: D moves stapler from box to basket.
5. C moves stapler from basket to box.
6. D moves stapler from box to bag.
7. D puts an apple in the box.

So the current state is:
- Bag: stapler
- Box: apple
- Basket: empty

B saw the stapler go into the box, then left. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. So B thinks the box still contains the stapler.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the box?" The correct answer is **apple**.

B will likely answer "stapler" (which is wrong) unless I tell B the correct answer.

Since B is my teammate, I should tell B what's in the box so our team gets 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer gives us 1 point, netting +0.5 points. If I pass, B will likely answer "stapler" and get 0 points.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room.
2. C puts a ball in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room. (D no longer sees what happens)
4. B puts a stapler in the box. (A, B, C see this)
5. I (A) move the stapler from the box to the bag. (A, B, C see this)
6. C moves the stapler from the bag to the box. (A, B, C see this)

Current state of containers:
- Basket: ball
- Box: stapler
- Bag: empty

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the basket?"

B was in the room the entire time and saw C put the ball in the basket. Nothing else was moved into or out of the basket. So B knows the basket contains the ball.

B should answer "ball" correctly, earning us 1 point.

There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know. I should Pass.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the basket.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. C puts a ball in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. I put a banana in the bag. (A, B, C see this)
5. C moves the banana from the bag to the box. (A, B, C see this)
6. C moves the banana from the box to the bag. (A, B, C see this)
7. I move the banana from the bag to the box. (A, B, C see this)

The question is: What is in the basket?

The ball was put in the basket in step 2, and it was never moved out. So the basket contains the ball.

B was in the room the entire time and saw everything I saw. B knows the ball is in the basket because B saw C put the ball in the basket in step 2, and nothing was ever removed from or added to the basket after that.

So B should be able to answer correctly without any help. I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the basket.

Let me trace through B's perspective:

1. **B is in the room**: C puts an apple in the basket. ✓ B sees this.
2. **B leaves the room**: C moves the apple from the basket to the bag. ✗ B does NOT see this.
3. **B enters the room**: D moves the apple from the bag to the basket. ✓ B sees this.
4. **D leaves the room**: B sees D leave.

So B saw:
- Apple placed in basket (step 1)
- D moves apple from bag to basket (step 3)

B knows the apple is currently in the basket. B can answer correctly!

Since B already knows the correct answer (apple is in the basket), I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: apple

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put an orange in the basket. ... B puts an apple in the bag. ... You move the apple from the bag to the box. ... D moves the apple from the box to the bag. ... You move the apple from the bag to the box. ...

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the basket.

Let me trace through what B has seen (B was in the room the entire time):

1. I put an orange in the basket - B saw this
2. B puts an apple in the bag - B did this
3. I move the apple from the bag to the box - B saw this
4. D moves the apple from the box to the bag - B saw this
5. I move the apple from the bag to the box - B saw this

So B knows the basket contains an orange. B was present for all events and saw me put the orange in the basket. Nothing else was moved into or out of the basket.

Since B already knows the answer, I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can answer correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room when I put an apple in the basket. B knows: basket has apple.
2. B leaves the room. B doesn't see what happens next.
3. While B is outside: C moves the apple from the basket to the bag. B doesn't know this.
4. B enters the room. B doesn't see the current state of containers, just knows they re-entered.
5. D puts a ball in the basket. B sees this happen.

So B knows:
- Apple was in the basket (from step 1)
- D put a ball in the basket (from step 5)

B would likely think the basket contains a ball (since D put a ball in the basket, and B saw that). The basket currently does contain a ball (the apple was moved out while B was gone, then D put a ball in).

So B should correctly answer "ball" for the basket. B has enough information to answer correctly without my help.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

So B does NOT know that I put a stapler in the bag. B would think the bag is still empty (or at least wouldn't know its contents). Since the question is directed at B about the bag, B needs to know the answer.

So B does NOT know that I put a stapler in the bag. B was outside when that happened. B will need to guess or might answer incorrectly.

Since I'm being asked about what B will answer, and B doesn't know what's in the bag, I should tell B what's in the bag so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point.

The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we get 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points. If I pass and B doesn't know, B will likely guess wrong and we get 0 points.

Action: The scenario is straightforward. I was in the room when I put a ball in the box. B was also in the room at that time, so B saw me put the ball in the box. After that, I left the room, then B left the room.

However, after I left, something could have happened before B left - C and D were still in the room and could have moved the ball. But B was still in the room and would have seen any changes. So B knows the current state of the box when B left.

The key question is: did anything happen between when I left and when B left? From my perspective (outside the room), I only know that B left the room after me. I don't know if C or D moved anything. But B would know, since B was still inside.

Since B was in the room the entire time and witnessed everything, B knows what's in the box. B has no reason to lie to me (we're teammates), and B already knows the answer.

The question will be asked to B, and B should know the correct answer. If nothing changed after I left, the answer is "ball." If C or D moved the ball while B was still there, B would know.

Since B already has full knowledge of what's in the box, there's no need for me to Tell or Ask anything. Any action would just cost us 0.5 points unnecessarily.

Action: The question will be asked to B about the contents of the box.

Let me think about what B knows. B was in the room when I put a ball in the box. B was also in the room when D put a brick in the basket. Then I left, then B left. 

After B left, we don't know if anything else happened in the room (C and D might still be in the room and could have moved things). But from B's perspective, B saw me put the ball in the box, and nothing else happened to the box before B left.

However, after B left, C and/or D could have changed the contents of the box. But B wouldn't know about that.

So B should know that the ball was in the box when B left. B should be able to answer "ball" correctly — unless C or D moved things after B left.

Wait, let me re-read the scenario. After I left and B left, the scenario ends with "..." which could mean more time passed. But nothing else is described to me. Since I'm outside the room, I wouldn't see what happens inside. But the scenario doesn't mention anyone else leaving or entering, which I would be aware of.

So C and D might still be in the room and could have moved things. But from my perspective, I don't know if they did.

The question is: what is actually in the box now? If C or D moved the ball out of the box after B and I left, then the answer might be different. But the scenario doesn't describe any further actions to anyone — the scenario seems complete as written.

Since the scenario only describes the actions that happened (and no further actions after B leaves), the box still contains the ball. B was present when I put the ball in the box and should know this.

B should be able to answer correctly without my help. I'll save the 0.5 points.

Action: The question will be asked to B about what is in the box.

Let me think about what B knows. B was in the room when I put a ball in the box. Then B put an apple in the basket. Then I left the room, then B left the room. 

After both of us left, C and D were still in the room. They could have moved objects around. But from B's perspective, B saw me put the ball in the box, and nothing else happened to the box while B was in the room. B doesn't know if C or D moved anything after B left.

However, the question is asking B what is in the box. B's last knowledge is that the ball is in the box. B should answer "ball" based on what B knows.

But wait - C and D were still in the room after we left. They might have changed things. The scenario only describes what I can see/know. Since I left before B, I don't know if anything happened between my departure and B's departure. But B would know about that period since B was still in the room.

Actually, re-reading: I left, then B left. Between those events, B was still in the room. The scenario doesn't mention anything happening in that interval (from my perspective I wouldn't see it, but it would still be described if it happened since the scenario describes what's relevant). The scenario seems complete as stated.

B knows the ball is in the box (from when I put it there), and nothing changed to the box while B was in the room. B should be able to answer correctly.

Since B should already know the answer (ball is in the box), there's no need to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag now and whether B knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I, B, C, and D are all in the room. I put a banana in the bag. Everyone sees this.
2. I leave the room. B, C, and D are still inside.
3. B leaves the room. C and D are still inside.
4. D leaves the room. C is still inside alone.
5. D enters the room. C and D are inside.
6. B enters the room. B, C, and D are inside.
7. B leaves the room. C and D are inside.

The key question is: what happened while C was alone in the room (between steps 3 and 4), and what happened when C and D were together (steps 4-5, 5-6, 6-7)?

I was outside the room from step 2 onward, so I don't know if C moved the banana. B was outside during steps 3-5, so B missed whatever C did alone and whatever C and D did together before B re-entered.

When B re-entered (step 6), B, C, and D were in the room. B then left (step 7). B would have seen anything that happened during step 6-7, but not what happened during steps 3-6.

So B last knew the banana was in the bag (from step 1), but C could have moved it while B was outside. When B re-entered, B wouldn't know the current state of the bag unless something happened while B was present.

B's knowledge: B saw me put the banana in the bag. B was gone during steps 3-6 and doesn't know if C moved things. B might incorrectly think the banana is still in the bag, or B might be uncertain.

Since I also don't know what happened after I left, I can't help B with better information. The banana might still be in the bag, or C might have moved it. 

However, B's best guess would be "banana" since that's the last known state, and I have the same information. Telling B "banana" would cost 0.5 points and B likely already thinks it's a banana. If B is wrong, we lose 0.5 points from the Tell with no gain.

Since I don't have any additional information beyond what B already knows, spending 0.5 points to tell B something they already know is wasteful.

Pass
B answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the bag (I saw this, as did C and D since we were all in the room).
- D left the room first, then B left.
- After both left, nothing else happened to the bag.

**What D knows:**
- D was in the room when B put the apple in the bag, so D knows the bag contains an apple.
- D left before B, but nothing happened to the bag after D left (or after B left).

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag. D knows the answer is "apple" because D witnessed B putting the apple in the bag.

**D's incentive:** D is on the Red team. If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. D has no reason to answer incorrectly since it benefits their own team.

Since D knows the correct answer (apple) and will want to answer correctly to score a point for the Red team, there's nothing I can do to prevent this. Any Tell action to D with false information would cost my team 0.5 points, and D has no reason to believe me over their own observation. An Ask action would also cost 0.5 points for no benefit.

The best action is to not waste points.

7. I move the ball from the basket to the box.

**What D knows:**
- D saw B put an apple in the bag (D was in the room at that time).
- D left the room before anything else happened.
- After D left, nothing happened to the bag - the apple is still in the bag.

So D knows the apple is in the bag, and the apple IS still in the bag. D should answer correctly on their own.

**Strategy consideration:**
Since D will be asked what's in the bag, and D knows the correct answer (apple), D should answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point. 

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell D incorrect information to try to mislead them, but D saw the apple being placed in the bag and nothing happened to the bag after that (from D's perspective, D left the room, so D doesn't know if anything changed). 

Actually, D left the room, so D doesn't know what happened after they left. Someone could have moved the apple out of the bag. If I tell D something misleading, D might doubt their knowledge since they weren't in the room.

Let me try to mislead D by telling them the bag's contents changed.

Tell(D, bag, ball)

This might make D think someone moved the apple out and put a ball in instead, since D knows they weren't in the room to observe changes. It costs 0.5 points but could prevent Red from gaining 1 point (net benefit of 0.5 points for us).

Tell(D, bag, ball)
D answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what D saw:
- D was in the room initially and saw B put an apple in the bag.
- D left the room.
- After D left: B left, I put an orange in the box, C moved orange to basket, I moved orange back to box, C moved orange to basket.

So D knows the apple was put in the bag, and D has no reason to think it was moved (nothing happened to the bag after D left - only the orange was being moved around between box and basket).

D will be asked what's in the bag. D knows the answer is the apple. D is on the Red team, so D will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point.

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - I can't communicate with D in a way that would help (telling D wrong information wouldn't help since D is on the opposing team and would ignore misleading info). 

I should Pass to save points rather than waste 0.5 points on an action that won't change the outcome.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. Bag=empty, box=empty, basket=empty.
2. B puts orange in box. (All see this: box=orange)
3. D leaves the room. (D's last knowledge: box=orange, bag=empty, basket=empty)
4. C moves orange from box to bag. (box=empty, bag=orange)
5. B puts stapler in box. (box=stapler, bag=orange)
6. C moves stapler from box to basket. (box=empty, bag=orange, basket=stapler)
7. B moves orange from bag to box. (box=orange, bag=empty, basket=stapler)
8. B leaves the room.

Current state: box=orange, bag=empty, basket=stapler.

D is being asked what's in the box. D left after step 2, so D last saw the orange being put in the box. D doesn't know about any subsequent moves. D would likely answer "orange" based on their last knowledge.

Wait - but D is on the Red team. D might know they don't have full information and could be wrong. However, D's best guess would be "orange" since that's the last thing D saw in the box.

The actual answer is orange. So if D answers "orange" (which is their best guess), Red gets 1 point.

Now, what can I do? I could:
- **Tell D wrong information** to mislead D, costing us 0.5 points but potentially preventing Red from getting 1 point (net gain of 0.5 for us).
- **Pass** and hope D gets it wrong (but D will likely guess orange, which is correct).

Since D will likely answer "orange" (which is correct), I should try to mislead D. I should tell D something different is in the box.

I'll tell D that the box contains the stapler (which was moved around, making it plausible).

Tell(D, box, stapler)
D answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room and put a brick in the bag.
2. B left the room - D saw this.
3. D moved the brick from the bag to the box - D knows this.
4. C put a ball in the bag - D saw this.
5. D left the room - D knows the bag has a ball at this point.

So D knows the bag contains a ball. D will answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D was present when C put the ball in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after D left. D knows the bag contains a ball.

I should Pass to avoid spending points unnecessarily. Any Tell to D with false information would cost 0.5 points, and D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). D knows what's in the bag from direct observation.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the question will be.

D is being asked what's in the bag. Let me trace what D saw:

1. D was in the room initially. D put a brick in the bag.
2. B leaves the room (D sees this).
3. D moves the brick from the bag to the box.
4. C puts a ball in the bag.
5. D leaves the room.

After D leaves:
- You move the brick from the box to the basket.
- C moves the brick from the basket to the box.
- You move the brick from the box to the basket.

So from D's perspective, when D left the room:
- The bag had a ball (C put it there)
- The box had a brick (D moved it there)
- The basket was empty

D doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So D would likely answer "ball" for the bag, which is actually correct! The ball is still in the bag - nothing happened to it after C put it there.

Let me verify the current state of the bag:
- C puts a ball in the bag (step 4)
- After that, only the brick was moved around (box → basket → box → basket)
- The ball was never moved from the bag.

So the bag currently contains the ball. D last saw C put a ball in the bag, and D would likely answer "ball."

Since D will probably answer correctly (giving Red a point), I should consider whether to use a Tell to mislead D. But Tell actions are private - I could Tell D false information to confuse them.

I should tell D something false about the bag to trick them into giving a wrong answer.

Tell(D, bag, brick)

This might make D think the ball was moved and a brick is now in the bag, causing D to second-guess and potentially answer "brick" instead of "ball." Though D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team...

Actually, D knows I'm on the Blue team (opposing team), so D might distrust my information. Telling D false info could backfire - D might think "A is lying, so the opposite must be true" and stick with "ball" (the correct answer).

Alternatively, if I tell D the truth (ball), D might think I'm lying and change their answer to something wrong.

Let me go with telling D the truth, hoping D distrusts me and changes their answer:

Tell(D, bag, ball)
D answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room initially. D put a brick in the bag.
2. B leaves the room (D sees this).
3. D moves the brick from the bag to the box.
4. C puts a ball in the bag.
5. D leaves the room.

After D leaves:
- You move the brick from the box to the basket.
- C moves the brick from the basket to the box.
- You move the brick from the box to the basket.

So at the end: the bag has a **ball**, the basket has a **brick**, and the box is **empty**.

D will be asked what's in the bag. From D's perspective, the last thing D saw before leaving was C putting a ball in the bag. After D left, nothing happened to the bag (the brick was moved around between box and basket, but the ball stayed in the bag). So D should know the bag contains a **ball**.

Since D is on the Red team and the question is about what's in the bag, D likely knows the correct answer (a ball) from their own observations. The ball was placed in the bag while D was present, and nothing happened to the bag after D left.

Since D can answer correctly on their own, there's nothing I need to do to help my team here. I shouldn't spend points on an action that won't benefit my team.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room initially. D put a stapler in the box.
2. B leaves the room. (D still in room)
3. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (D knows: bag=stapler, box=empty)
4. C puts a ball in the box. (D knows: bag=stapler, box=ball)
5. D leaves the room. At this point, D believes: bag=stapler, box=ball, basket=empty.

After D leaves:
6. C moves the stapler from the bag to the basket.
7. C moves the ball from the box to the bag.
8. C moves the ball from the bag to the box.

So the actual state is: bag=empty, box=ball, basket=stapler.

D believes the box contains a ball (from what D last saw before leaving). The actual contents of the box IS a ball.

So D will likely answer "ball" which is correct, giving the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell D wrong information to try to trick D into answering incorrectly. But D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Let me think about whether to try to mislead D. If I tell D the box contains something else, D might be suspicious since I'm on the Blue team and would want D to answer wrong. D would likely ignore my misinformation.

However, if I tell D something that seems plausible... D knows that after they left, C was still in the room and could have moved things. So D might be uncertain. But D's best guess would still be "ball" since that's what they last saw.

If I tell D the box contains the stapler, D might think C moved things around after D left. But D would likely be skeptical of information from an opponent.

The cost of a Tell is 0.5 points. If it fails to mislead D, we lose 0.5 for nothing. If it succeeds, we prevent Red from getting 1 point, net benefit of 0.5 points.

Given that D would likely distrust information from an opponent, the expected value of trying to mislead is probably negative. I'll pass.

Pass

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room.
2. C puts an apple in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
3. C leaves the room.
4. B puts a banana in the box. (C doesn't see this.)
5. I move the banana from the box to the basket. (C doesn't see this.)
6. D moves the banana from the basket to the box. (C doesn't see this.)

Current state of containers:
- Bag: apple (unchanged since C put it there)
- Box: banana
- Basket: empty

C will be asked what is in the bag. C saw herself put an apple in the bag, and then she left. She wasn't present for any subsequent changes, and nothing happened to the bag after she left. So C knows the apple is in the bag.

The correct answer is "apple," and C should know this since she put it there and nothing changed after she left. C is on the Red team, so if C answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point.

There's nothing I can do to help my team here - the question is being asked to C (an opponent), and C already knows the correct answer. Telling C wrong information would cost me 0.5 points and C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team).

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- C put an apple in the bag, then left the room.
- After C left: B put a banana in the box, I moved it to the basket, D moved it back to the box, I moved it back to the basket.
- Current state: bag has apple, basket has banana, box is empty.

**What C knows:**
- C put an apple in the bag and then left.
- C knows B, D, and I remained in the room, but doesn't know what happened after leaving.
- C should believe the bag still has an apple (since C has no information about changes to it).

**The question:** I will be asked what C says is in the bag.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask C what is in the bag."

C knows they put an apple in the bag. Nobody moved anything out of the bag (the apple is still there). C should answer "apple" which would be correct, giving Red 1 point.

**My strategic options:**
- I could Tell C false information to trick C into giving a wrong answer. For example, I could tell C that the bag contains something else, hoping C believes me and answers incorrectly. But this costs 0.5 points.
- However, C is on the Red team. C has no reason to trust me (player A, on the Blue team). C would likely ignore my misinformation and stick with what they know.
- If I Tell D something false, that doesn't help since D isn't being asked.
- Telling B something doesn't help since B isn't being asked either.

Since C put the apple in the bag themselves and has direct knowledge of this, and since C is on the opposing team and would have no reason to trust anything I tell them, attempting to mislead C would likely just cost us 0.5 points without changing C's answer.

The best action is to Pass and save the 0.5 points.

C's best guess would be "brick" (since that's what C last saw in the box before leaving). And actually, the brick IS in the box right now (D moved it back). So C would likely answer "brick" and get it correct, earning Red 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C false information to mislead them. If I tell C something different is in the box, C might change their answer.

Let me think: If I tell C that something else is in the box (like the orange), C might be suspicious since I'm on the opposing team. C knows I have incentive to lie. But C also doesn't know what happened after leaving.

Actually, C might reason: "A is on the Blue team and has incentive to mislead me. If A tells me something, I should probably not trust it." This could backfire.

Alternatively, if I tell C the box contains the brick, C would already believe that, so it wastes 0.5 points without changing anything.

If I tell C the box contains the orange, C might think: "Why would A tell me this? A wants me to get it wrong. Maybe A is lying, so the box doesn't contain the orange. But I thought it had the brick..." C would likely stick with brick or become uncertain.

Since C is likely to answer "brick" correctly anyway, and any Tell action costs 0.5 points and C will probably distrust me as an opponent, the best move is probably to Pass and save the 0.5 points.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an apple in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... You move the apple from the basket to the bag. ... You put a ball in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ...

Respond with your action.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

1. **C was in the room** when D put the apple in the basket. Then C left the room.
2. After C left, I moved the apple from the basket to the bag, and put a ball in the basket.
3. C doesn't know about these changes since C was outside the room.

So C believes the basket still contains the **apple** (which is what C saw before leaving). But the basket actually contains a **ball**.

Since I'm asked about what C will answer: C will likely say "apple" because that's what C last saw in the basket. But the correct answer is "ball."

The question is being asked to C (a Red team player). If C answers correctly, Red gets a point. If C answers incorrectly, Red gets nothing.

C doesn't know the basket contents changed. C will likely say "apple" which is wrong. That's good for my team - Red won't score.

However, D was in the room when I moved the apple and put the ball in the basket. D could potentially Tell C the correct answer. But it's MY turn right now, not D's turn.

Wait - the action phase is just for me right now. D doesn't get to act this turn.

So C will likely answer "apple" (incorrect), meaning Red scores 0 points. This is good for Blue.

I should **Pass** - there's no benefit to spending 0.5 points. I don't need to tell C anything (that would help Red), and I don't need to ask anyone anything.

Pass
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what C saw before leaving the room:
1. D puts an apple in the basket. (C saw this)
2. C leaves the room.

After C left, C didn't see any of the subsequent moves. So C believes the apple is still in the basket.

But the actual contents of the basket: After C left, I moved the apple from basket to bag, then put a ball in the basket. The ball has remained in the basket throughout all subsequent moves (only the apple was moved around after that).

So the basket currently contains: **a ball**.

C will be asked what's in the basket. C thinks the apple is in the basket (since that's the last thing C saw before leaving). C will likely answer "apple," which is wrong. The correct answer is "ball."

Since C is on the Red team, I want C to answer incorrectly. C is already likely to answer "apple" (incorrect), so I don't need to do anything. Telling C the truth would help the Red team, and telling C a lie might or might not help - but C is already going to get it wrong.

I should Pass to save points and let C answer incorrectly.

C answers: apple

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**C's perspective:**
- C was in the room when D put an apple in the basket.
- C then left the room.

So C thinks the apple is still in the basket. C will likely answer "apple" for the basket.

**The actual contents of the basket:** a ball.

C is on the Red team. If C answers "apple," that's wrong, and Red gets 0 points. The correct answer is "ball."

Since C is on the opposing team, I want C to answer incorrectly. C already believes the basket contains an apple (which is wrong), so I should NOT correct C.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- D put a ball in the bag, then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the ball from the bag to the box, and put a banana in the bag.
- D doesn't know about C's moves (D was outside the room), so D thinks the ball is still in the bag.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

**What D believes:** D thinks the bag contains the ball (since D left before C made changes).

**The actual answer:** The bag contains a banana.

**D is on the Red team.** If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. If D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points.

Since D doesn't know about the switch, D will likely answer "ball" — which is wrong. This is good for my team (Blue).

**Should I act?**
- If I **Pass**: D will likely say "ball" (wrong). Red gets 0 points. Blue loses nothing. This is good for Blue.
- If I **Tell D the truth** (Tell(D, bag, banana)): D would know the correct answer and Red would get 1 point, costing Blue 0.5 points too. Terrible for Blue.
- If I **Tell D a lie** (Tell(D, bag, ball)): This reinforces D's wrong belief, but costs 0.5 points. Unnecessary since D already believes it's the ball.

The best action is to **Pass** — D will answer incorrectly on their own, and it costs me nothing.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would benefit my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when the ball was put in the bag.
- D left the room, so D doesn't know about any changes after that.
- D knows B left after them, but doesn't know what C or I did.
- D believes: bag = ball (from when D last saw it)

**Current actual state:**
- Bag = banana
- Basket = ball
- Box = empty

**The question:** I (Blue team) will be asked... no, **D (Red team)** will be asked what's in the bag.

D thinks the ball is in the bag (since D left before C moved things around). The actual answer is **banana**.

Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer **incorrectly**. D currently believes the bag contains the ball, which is wrong. If D answers "ball," they get 0 points.

If I Tell D the truth (banana is in the bag), that would help the Red team score 1 point, which is bad for me. If I tell D a lie, it might confuse things but D already has the wrong answer.

The best action is to **Pass** - D already has the wrong belief about the bag's contents, so there's no need to spend points or risk correcting D's misconception.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) in room. D puts ball in bag.
2. D leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. C moves ball from bag to box.
5. C puts banana in bag.
6. I move ball from box to basket.
7. I move ball from basket to box.

**Current state:** Ball is in box, banana is in bag, basket is empty.

**What D knows:** D put a ball in the bag, then left. D knows B left after them, but doesn't know what happened inside the room after leaving. So D thinks the ball is still in the bag.

**The question is for D: "What is in the bag?"**

D will likely answer "ball" (since that's what D last knew). But the actual answer is "banana."

D is on the Red team. If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. If D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points.

Since D is on the opposing team, I want D to answer **incorrectly**. D currently believes the ball is in the bag, which is wrong (it's actually a banana). So D's natural answer would be "ball," which is incorrect - good for me!

If I Tell D the truth, that would help the Red team. If I Pass, D will likely say "ball" and be wrong. 

However, I should consider whether C (D's teammate) might use their turn to Tell D the correct answer. C was in the room and saw everything - C knows the banana is in the bag. C could Tell D the correct contents.

But right now it's my turn. The best move is to **Pass** - spending no points and letting D answer with their outdated information ("ball"), which would be wrong.

Alternatively, I could try to mislead D by telling them something wrong, but D already has wrong information, so spending 0.5 points to mislead would be wasteful. Even worse, if I tell D something, D might become suspicious and reconsider.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what action would best help my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room initially and put a brick in the bag.
- D left the room.
- After leaving, D knows B left the room later, but doesn't know about any moves that happened after D left.
- So D thinks: the brick is still in the bag (last thing D saw).

**The actual state:**
- The box contains the brick.
- The bag contains a banana.
- The basket is empty.

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the bag. Wait, no - D will be asked what is in the bag.

D is on the Red team. D will answer what's in the bag. D thinks the brick is in the bag (since D left before any moves happened). The actual contents of the bag is a banana.

So D will likely answer "brick" which is **wrong**. That means the Red team won't get a point, which is good for us.

Now, should I use a Tell action to try to help D get the wrong answer? D is on the opposing team, so I could try to mislead D. But D already has the wrong information - D thinks the brick is in the bag when it's actually a banana.

However, if I Tell D something, D might become suspicious or it might accidentally help them. There's also a risk: what if C communicates with D? C knows the true state (banana in the bag) since C was in the room the whole time. But it's currently MY turn, not C's turn. 

Wait - the action phase is just my turn right now. After my action, there might be other players' turns before the answer phase. If C gets a turn, C could Tell D the correct answer (banana in the bag), which would give Red a point.

I could try to mislead D by telling D something wrong, but D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. Or I could pass and save the 0.5 points, hoping D answers incorrectly.

Actually, I could preemptively tell D wrong information to create confusion, but since D already believes the wrong thing (brick), and the truth is banana, any Tell from me might just confuse things. If C tells D "banana," D might believe C (teammate) over me.

The best play is to Pass - save the 0.5 points and let D answer incorrectly based on their outdated knowledge.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

2. **D** was in the room when C put the banana in the basket. Then D left the room. After D left, I moved the banana from the basket to the bag, and B put a stapler in the basket.

The question will be asked to D: "What is in the basket?"

D will likely answer "banana" because that's what D last saw. But the actual contents of the basket is a **stapler**.

Since D is on the Red team, if D answers incorrectly, the Red team gets 0 points. D's natural answer would be "banana" (wrong), which is good for us.

The risk of taking any action: If I Tell D anything, I might accidentally help D get the right answer. There's no reason to help D since D is on the opposing team.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the question will be.

D was in the room when C put the banana in the basket. Then C left, then D left. After D left, several things happened that D is unaware of:
- I moved the banana from the basket to the bag
- B put a stapler in the basket
- B moved the banana from the bag to the box
- I moved the banana from the box to the bag
- B moved the banana from the bag to the box

So D last saw the banana go into the basket, and then left. D would believe the banana is still in the basket.

The actual contents of the basket is the **stapler**.

D will likely answer "banana" for the basket, which is incorrect. That means Red gets 0 points from this question, which is good for us.

There's no reason for me to spend points helping D (a Red team player) get the right answer. I should Pass.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a banana in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the banana from the basket to the bag. ... B puts a stapler in the basket. ... B moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... B moves the banana from the box to the bag. ...

I am going to ask D what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what I can do to help my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room together.
2. C puts a banana in the basket - everyone sees this.
3. C leaves the room - C no longer sees what happens inside.
4. D leaves the room - D no longer sees what happens inside.
5. After both C and D leave: I move the banana from basket to bag, B puts a stapler in the basket, B moves the banana from bag to box, then box to bag.

So D's knowledge: D saw C put a banana in the basket, then C left, then D left. D doesn't know about any changes after that. D would believe the banana is still in the basket.

Current actual state:
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: stapler

D will be asked what's in the basket. D likely thinks it's the banana (which is wrong). The correct answer is "stapler."

Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer incorrectly. D currently thinks the basket has a banana, which is wrong - that's good for my team!

However, D might receive information from C. But C also left before any changes, so C also thinks the banana is in the basket.

If I Pass, D will likely answer "banana" which is incorrect - Red team gets 0 points. That's the best outcome for my Blue team.

If I Tell D the truth, that would help the Red team - bad for me.
If I Tell D a lie, it might confuse things but D already has the wrong answer.

The optimal action is to Pass - D already has incorrect information, and there's no need to spend points or risk helping the Red team.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when C put an orange in the basket.
- D then left the room (after C left).
- After D left, B moved the orange from basket to bag, I moved it from bag to basket, then to box, and B put a stapler in the basket.
- D doesn't know about any of these moves after leaving.

So D thinks the orange is still in the basket. D will likely answer "orange" for the basket.

**The actual contents of the basket:** a stapler.

So D will answer "orange" which is **wrong**. That's good for my team (Blue) since D is on the Red team - Red won't get a point.

Since D is going to answer incorrectly on their own, I don't need to spend points to help or interfere. There's no benefit to telling D the truth (that would help Red), and no benefit to telling D a lie (D is already going to answer wrong). Any action I take would cost 0.5 points unnecessarily.

Pass
D answers: orange
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what's in the box.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts a banana in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
3. D leaves the room.
4. C moves the banana from the box to the basket. (D doesn't see this - D is outside.)
5. D enters the room.
6. C moves the banana from the basket to the box. (D sees this - D is back in the room.)
7. I (A) leave the room.
8. B leaves the room.

After step 7 and 8, I don't know what happened in the room after I left. But at the time I left, the banana was in the box (from step 6).

Now, what does D know? D saw the banana placed in the box (step 2), missed step 4, saw the banana moved from basket to box (step 6), and then was in the room for whatever happened after A and B left.

The question is: what is currently in the box? I left the room, so I don't know if anything changed after I left. B also left, so B doesn't know either.

D is being asked what's in the box. D was in the room the entire time after step 5, so D knows the current state of the box. D is on the Red team, so D will answer correctly if D knows the answer (which D does, since D stayed in the room).

Since D is on the opposing team and will answer correctly (earning Red 1 point), I should consider whether I can mislead D. But D was in the room the whole time after re-entering, so D has direct knowledge of what's in the box currently. Any Tell action trying to mislead D would be wasted since D knows the truth from direct observation.

There's nothing I can do to change D's knowledge - D has firsthand information about the current state of the box. Spending 0.5 points on an Ask or Tell would just cost my team points without benefit.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what D knows about the basket.

Let me trace through D's perspective:

1. D is in the room initially. B puts a ball in the basket. **D sees this.**
2. D leaves the room.
3. While D is outside: I move the ball from the basket to the bag. **D doesn't see this.**
4. D enters the room.
5. I put a stapler in the basket. **D sees this.**
6. I leave the room.

So D saw:
- B put a ball in the basket
- Then D left and came back
- Then I put a stapler in the basket

Now, D knows the basket can only hold one object. When D saw me put a stapler in the basket, D would know the stapler is now in the basket. But D might think the ball was still there when the stapler was placed - however, since containers hold at most one object, D would realize the stapler replaced whatever was in the basket.

Actually, let me reconsider. D saw the ball go into the basket, then left. D didn't see the ball get moved. When D returned, D then saw me put a stapler in the basket. Since only one object can be in a container, D would know the stapler is in the basket now (it either replaced the ball or was put in after the ball was removed - either way, the stapler is there).

The correct answer is: the basket contains the **stapler**.

D likely knows this because D saw me put the stapler in the basket. D should answer correctly.

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's anything I can do. I could try to Tell D false information to confuse them, but D directly saw me put the stapler in the basket, so D would likely trust their own observation over anything I tell them.

Any Tell action would cost 0.5 points and D would likely ignore it since they saw the stapler go in. So the best action is to Pass.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to think carefully about what I know.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. I put a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
3. I leave the room. (Now I can't see what happens inside, but I know who enters/leaves.)
4. I enter the room. (I can now see what happens again.)
5. D moves the brick from the bag to the box. (I see this.)

Wait - step 5 says D moves the brick from the **bag** to the **box**. But I put the brick in the **box** in step 2. That means while I was outside the room, someone must have moved the brick from the box to the bag. I didn't see that happen, but it must have occurred because D is now moving it from the bag to the box.

So after step 5, the brick is in the box.

The question is: what is in the box? Based on what I observed, the brick is currently in the box (D just moved it there).

But I need to consider: could anything else have happened while I was outside? Someone could have added other objects or moved things around. I only know about the brick. While I was outside, I didn't see any objects being added to containers. When I came back, I saw D move the brick from the bag to the box - but there could be other changes I'm not aware of.

However, since each container can hold at most one object, and D moved the brick into the box, the box contains the brick. Even if something else was placed in the box while I was away, D moving the brick into the box means the brick is now the contents of the box (and only one object can be in a container).

I'm confident the answer is "brick." No need to spend points asking anyone.

Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

The answer is straightforward. I was in the room when C put an apple in the basket. Even though I later left the room, I already observed this action. No one could have moved the apple after I left (the scenario doesn't mention any further actions after I left).

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events from my perspective:

1. **I'm in the room** with B, C, and D. Bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. **B leaves the room.** (I see this)
3. **D leaves the room.** (I see this)
4. **C puts a stapler in the basket.** (I see this - basket has stapler)
5. **B enters the room.** (I see this)
6. **D enters the room.** (I see this)
7. **I leave the room.** (Now I can't see what happens inside)
8. **I enter the room.** (I can see again)
9. **C moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.** (I see this - bag has stapler, basket is empty)
10. **D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket.** (I see this - basket has stapler, bag is empty)
11. **I leave the room.** (Now I can't see what happens inside)

At the point I last left the room (step 11), the basket had the stapler. But I don't know if anything happened after I left.

The question is: did anything happen after I left the room in step 11? The scenario ends with "..." after I leave, which means time passes. I don't know if anyone moved anything.

However, I know who is in the room after I leave. B, C, and D were all in the room when I left. I wasn't told about anyone entering or leaving after that (I would be aware of entries/exits even while outside).

Since I don't know if anything changed after I left, I could ask someone. But the last state I observed was the stapler in the basket. The risk is that someone moved it after I left.

Let me consider: I could ask B (my teammate) what's in the basket, costing 0.5 points. If I answer correctly, we get 1 point, netting 0.5. If I pass and answer correctly, we get 1 point. If I pass and answer wrong, we get 0.

Given that the scenario might have had changes after I left (the "..." suggests possible events), it's safer to ask my teammate.

Ask(B, basket)
A answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. D puts a ball in the box.
2. I leave the room. (Things could happen that I don't see)
3. I enter the room. (I can see what happens again)
4. C moves the ball from the box to the basket. (I see this)
5. D moves the ball from the basket to the box. (I see this)
6. I leave the room. (Things could happen that I don't see)
7. B leaves the room.

So after step 5, the ball is in the box. But then I left the room (step 6), and things could have happened between step 6 and step 7 (before B left). Also, things could have happened after B left.

Between my leaving (step 6) and B leaving (step 7), B was still in the room with C and D. B would have seen anything that happened during that time. After B left, C and D are alone in the room and could have moved things.

So I don't know the current state of the box with certainty. B would know what happened between my departure and B's departure, but not what happened after B left.

The last state I knew: ball is in the box. B might know if anything changed between my leaving and B's leaving. But after B left, C and D could have changed things.

However, the question is asking ME what's in the box. I need to answer correctly. Let me think about whether to ask B or just guess.

If I ask B, B can tell me what happened between my leaving and B's leaving. But neither of us knows what C and D did after B left. I could ask C or D, but they're opponents and might lie.

The cost of asking is 0.5 points, and the reward for correct answer is 1 point. If asking B gives me useful info, it's worth it. But if C and D moved things after B left, even B won't know.

Let me consider: the scenario says "B leaves the room" and then the scenario ends with "..." potentially. Actually, the scenario as written ends with "B leaves the room. ..." - so things could happen after that.

Since neither B nor I can know what C and D did after we both left, asking B only helps with the intermediate period. The expected value of asking might not be worth 0.5 points since C and D could still change things after.

I'll pass and guess that the ball is still in the box (its last known position), saving the 0.5 points.

Pass
A answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains banana.

After I left, C also left, leaving only B and D in the room. I don't know if anything changed after I left, but based on what I observed, the box contains an apple.

Pass
A answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains banana.

The answer is straightforward. I was in the room when C put the apple in the box, and nothing happened to the box after that while I was still in the room. Let me trace through the events:

1. C puts an apple in the box (I saw this)
2. D enters the room
3. C puts a brick in the basket (I saw this)
4. D leaves the room
5. D enters the room
6. I leave the room
7. C leaves the room

After I left, only B and D were in the room (then C left too). I don't know if anything changed after I left, but based on what I observed, the apple was in the box when I left.

I'll Pass since I already know the answer: the box contains the **apple**.

Action: The banana was moved by C back into the box before I left the room. I saw this happen, so I know the box contains the banana.

However, after I left the room, things could have changed. Let me think about this more carefully.

Looking at the scenario from my perspective:
1. Everyone is in the room. B puts a banana in the box.
2. I leave the room.
3. I enter the room. (I don't know what happened while I was out, but when I re-enter, I can observe the current state... actually, no - players cannot see inside containers, so I can't see what's in containers when I enter.)
4. D moves the banana from the box to the basket. (I see this.)
5. C moves the banana from the basket to the box. (I see this.)
6. I leave the room.

After step 5, the banana is in the box. But after I leave in step 6, C and D (and possibly B) are still in the room and could move things around. I don't know if anything happened after I left.

Wait - the scenario says "..." after I leave, meaning time passes. Things could have changed. I need to consider whether B is still in the room and could tell me, or whether I should ask someone.

B was in the room initially. The scenario doesn't mention B leaving, so B should still be in the room and would know the current state of the box.

Since I'm being asked the question, I should ask B what's in the box to make sure nothing changed after I left.

Ask(B, box)
A answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

1. Everyone starts in the room.
2. I put an apple in the box. (B sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. After B left: I put an orange in the basket, C moved orange from basket to bag, I moved orange from bag to basket.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether B knows the answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a banana in the bag. (Everyone in the room: A, B, C, D)
2. D leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. C moves the banana from the bag to the box. (Only A and C see this)
5. C puts a ball in the bag. (Only A and C see this)
6. C moves the ball from the bag to the basket. (Only A and C see this)
7. C moves the banana from the box to the bag. (Only A and C see this)

So the bag currently contains: **banana**

B's perspective: B saw me put a banana in the bag, then B left the room. B doesn't know about any of C's moves. So B would think the banana is still in the bag.

B would answer "banana" which is actually correct! The banana is indeed back in the bag after C's series of moves.

Since B will naturally answer "banana" (which is correct), I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: banana

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room when C put a banana in the bag.
2. B was in the room when C left.
3. B was in the room when I moved the banana from the bag to the box.
4. B was in the room when I put an orange in the bag.
5. B then left the room.
6. After B left: D moved banana from box to basket, I moved banana from basket to box, D moved banana from box to basket.

So B knows:
- Bag: orange (B saw me put it there, and nothing happened to the bag after B left)
- Box: banana (B saw me move it there, but B doesn't know it was moved after B left)
- Basket: unknown to B (empty as far as B knows)

The question is: "What is in the bag?"

B saw me put an orange in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after B left. So B knows the bag contains an orange.

The current actual state:
- Bag: orange
- Box: empty
- Basket: banana

B should correctly answer "orange" for the bag. I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what B will answer when asked about the bag.

Let me trace through what B saw:

1. Everyone starts in the room. C puts a banana in the bag. ✓ B sees this.
2. C leaves the room. ✓ B sees this.
3. I move the banana from the bag to the box. ✓ B sees this.
4. I put an orange in the bag. ✓ B sees this.
5. B leaves the room. After this point, B doesn't see anything else.

So from B's perspective, when B left the room:
- Bag: orange
- Box: banana
- Basket: empty

B knows the bag contains an orange, which is still correct (the orange was never moved after being placed in the bag).

So B will correctly answer "orange" for the bag. I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

B answers: orange

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a brick in the bag. ... C leaves the room. ... You move the brick from the bag to the box. ... You put an orange in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the brick from the box to the basket. ... D moves the orange from the bag to the box. ... D moves the orange from the box to the bag. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario from B's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room. B sees C put a brick in the bag.
2. C leaves the room.
3. B sees me move the brick from the bag to the box.
4. B sees me put an orange in the bag.
5. B leaves the room.
6. After B leaves, D moves the brick from the box to the basket (B doesn't see this).
7. After B leaves, D moves the orange from the bag to the box (B doesn't see this).
8. After B leaves, D moves the orange from the box to the bag (B doesn't see this).

So the current actual state is:
- Bag: orange
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

From B's perspective (when B left):
- Bag: orange
- Box: brick
- Basket: empty

B doesn't know about the moves D made after B left. So B would think the bag contains the orange, which happens to also be the correct answer (since D moved the orange out of the bag and then back into the bag).

Since B would naturally answer "orange" for the bag (based on what B last saw), and the actual contents of the bag IS the orange, B will answer correctly without any help from me.

I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. A (me), B, and D are in the room.
2. D puts a stapler in the box. (B sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (B knows: stapler is in the box)
4. D puts an apple in the bag. (B doesn't see this)
5. I move the apple from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
6. D moves the apple from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)

Current state:
- Box: stapler
- Bag: apple
- Basket: empty

The question is: What is in the box?

B saw D put the stapler in the box before leaving. After B left, nothing happened to the box - the apple was moved around between the bag and basket, but the stapler stayed in the box.

So B should know the answer: the box contains a stapler. B saw it being placed there and never saw it removed (because it wasn't removed).

Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B. I should Pass.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

6. D moves the banana from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
7. I move the banana from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)

Current state of containers:
- Box: stapler
- Bag: empty
- Basket: banana

What B knows:
- B saw D put a stapler in the box before leaving.
- B doesn't know about any changes after leaving.
- Since B saw the stapler go in the box, B should know the box contains a stapler.

The question is: "What is in the box?" directed at B.

B saw D put the stapler in the box, and nothing happened to the box after B left (only the banana was moved around between the bag and basket). So B should correctly know the box contains a **stapler**.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. D puts a ball in the box. (A, B, and D all see this)
2. B leaves the room.
3. After B leaves: D moves the ball from the box to the bag.
4. D puts an apple in the box.
5. D moves the apple from the box to the basket.
6. D moves the ball from the bag to the box.

So the current state is:
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty
- Basket: apple

B saw the ball go into the box, then left. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. So B would think the box still contains the ball.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B.

The box currently contains the ball. B believes the box contains the ball (from what B saw before leaving).

So B will likely answer "ball" which is correct! That means we get 1 point without me needing to spend 0.5 points on a Tell action.

I should Pass.

B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a banana in the bag, then left the room.
- After B left, D moved the banana from the bag to the box, and put an orange in the bag.
- C then left the room.
- B doesn't know about the changes D made (B was outside the room).

**What B thinks:** B believes the banana is still in the bag (since B left before the changes).

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the bag. The correct answer is **orange**.

**B's likely answer:** B will probably say "banana" (based on B's last knowledge), which would be **wrong**.

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but a correct answer gives 1 point, netting us +0.5 points.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: orange
- Box: empty
- Basket: banana

**What B knows:**
B was in the room when they put a banana in the bag, then B left. After that, B has no knowledge of what happened inside the room. So B thinks the bag still contains a banana.

**The question:** I will be asked what B says is in the bag. Wait, no - B will be asked what is in the bag.

B thinks the bag contains a banana (since B left before any changes were made). The actual contents of the bag is an orange.

**B will answer "banana"** which is incorrect. So Red gets 0 points from this, but Blue also gets 0 points.

Wait - B is on my team (Blue). If B answers incorrectly, Blue doesn't get the point. I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and earn Blue 1 point.

The cost of a Tell action is 0.5 points. If B answers correctly, Blue gets 1 point. Net gain: 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 points.

If I Pass, B will likely answer "banana" (what B last knew), which is wrong, and Blue gets 0 points.

So telling B is worth +0.5 points net, which is better than passing.

Tell(B, bag, orange)
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

So the current state is:

B will likely answer "brick" since that's what B last knew. But the correct answer is "orange."

Since B is my teammate, I should tell B what's actually in the box so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The Tell action costs 0.5 points, so the net gain would be 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 points.

If I Pass, B will answer "brick" (incorrect) and we get 0 points.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I saw everything. The ball was put in the basket by D, then after B left, C moved the ball to the bag and put a stapler in the basket. So the basket currently contains a **stapler**.

**What B knows:** B saw D put a ball in the basket, then B left the room. B doesn't know about C's subsequent actions. So B thinks the basket contains a **ball**.

**What C knows:** C knows everything that happened (was in the room the whole time). The basket has a stapler.

**What D knows:** D put the ball in the basket, then left. D doesn't know about C moving things around. D thinks the basket has a ball.

The question will be asked to **B**: "What is in the basket?" B will likely answer "ball" based on their knowledge, which is **wrong** (the correct answer is "stapler").

Since B is my teammate, I should tell B the correct contents of the basket so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The Tell action costs 0.5 points, but a correct answer gives 1 point, netting us +0.5 points.

If I Pass, B will likely answer "ball" and get 0 points. If I Tell, we spend 0.5 but gain 1 for a net of +0.5.

- Box: empty
- Basket: stapler

B's knowledge (since B left after step 2):
- B knows the ball was put in the basket.
- B doesn't know about any moves after leaving.
- So B thinks: Basket = ball.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to B.

B will answer "ball" based on their knowledge, but the correct answer is "stapler."

I need to tell B what's actually in the basket so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer gives 1 point, so net gain is 0.5 points.

If I pass, B will answer "ball" which is wrong, and we get 0 points.

So the optimal action is to tell B.

Tell(B, basket, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything:
- Bag: empty
- Box: apple
- Basket: stapler

**What B knows:** B was in the room initially and saw D put the apple in the basket. Then B left. B doesn't know about any moves after that. So B thinks:
- Basket: apple (last thing B saw before leaving)
- Bag: empty
- Box: empty

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the basket. B thinks the apple is in the basket, but it's actually the stapler.

Since B is my teammate, I should tell B the correct contents of the basket so B can answer correctly and earn us 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer gives us 1 point, netting 0.5 points.

Tell(B, basket, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

**Me (A):** I saw everything. The box currently contains a ball. The bag contains a stapler. The basket is empty.

**B:** B saw C put the stapler in the box, then B left the room. B doesn't know about C moving the stapler to the bag or D putting a ball in the box. So B thinks the box contains the stapler.

**C and D:** They both saw everything and know the box contains a ball.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the box?" The correct answer is **a ball**.

B currently thinks the box has a stapler (which is wrong). I need to tell B the correct contents of the box so our team gets the point.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and whether B knows it.

Let me trace through the events:
1. C puts a stapler in the box.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. D puts a ball in the box. (B doesn't see this)

6. I move the stapler from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
7. D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)

So the current state:
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty
- Basket: stapler

B left after step 1, so B last saw the stapler in the box. B would think the box contains the stapler, but it actually contains the ball.

I need to tell B what's in the box so B answers correctly. The correct answer is "ball."

Final state:

B left after seeing the stapler placed in the box. B doesn't know about any subsequent changes. So B would think the box still contains the stapler, but the correct answer is the ball.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts an orange in the bag.
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves the orange from the bag to the basket.
5. C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.
6. C moves the orange from the bag to the box.
7. D puts a ball in the bag.

So the current state is:
- Bag: ball
- Box: orange
- Basket: empty

B saw: C put an orange in the bag, then B left. B doesn't know about any moves after that. So B thinks the bag still contains the orange.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B. The correct answer is "ball."

B will likely answer "orange" (which is wrong) because that's the last thing B saw put in the bag before leaving.

I need to tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer earns 1 point, so net gain is 0.5 points.

If I don't tell B, B will answer "orange" which is wrong, and we get 0 points.

B answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Let me trace through what B saw:

1. All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room initially.
2. C puts a stapler in the box - **B sees this**.
3. C leaves the room - B sees this.

6. I move the ball from the bag to the basket - B sees this.

So B was in the room the entire time and saw C put the stapler in the box. The box still contains the stapler (nothing was moved out of it).

B knows the box contains the stapler. B can answer correctly without any help from me.

2. C left the room.
3. B put an apple in the bag.
4. I moved the apple from bag to basket.
5. I moved the apple from basket to bag.
6. D moved the apple from bag to basket.

The box still has the stapler in it, and B saw C put the stapler in the box. Nothing else happened to the box. So B knows the box contains a stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can answer correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw:

1. **B is in the room**: C puts an apple in the bag. (B sees this)
2. **B leaves the room.**
3. **B is outside**: C moves the apple from the bag to the box. (B does NOT see this)
4. **B enters the room.**
5. **B is in the room**: D moves the apple from the box to the bag. (B sees this)
6. **C leaves the room.** (B sees this)

So B saw:
- Apple put in bag (step 1)
- D moves apple from box to bag (step 5)

B missed step 3 (apple moved from bag to box), but B did see step 5 where D moves the apple from the box to the bag. 

From B's perspective, B knows:
- Apple was in the bag initially
- Then B left and came back
- D moved the apple from the box to the bag

So B knows the apple is currently in the bag. B can answer correctly.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" The answer is "apple," and B should know this since B saw D move the apple to the bag in step 5.

Since B already has the correct information, I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the bag.

Let me trace through what B saw, since B was in the room the entire time:

1. I put an apple in the bag - B saw this
2. C puts a banana in the box - B saw this
3. I move the banana from the box to the basket - B saw this
4. I move the banana from the basket to the box - B saw this
5. D moves the banana from the box to the basket - B saw this

So B knows the apple is in the bag. B was present for all events and saw everything.

Since B already knows the answer, I should Pass to save points.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B needs help answering correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw:

1. B is in the room: sees me put a banana in the bag.
2. B leaves the room.
3. While B is outside: D moves the banana from the bag to the box. B doesn't see this.
4. B enters the room.
5. While B is in the room: C moves the banana from the box to the bag. B sees this.

So when B re-enters the room, B sees C move the banana from the box to the bag. This tells B that the banana is now in the bag.

But wait - B left when the banana was in the bag. B didn't see it move to the box. When B comes back, B sees "C moves the banana from the box to the bag." This reveals to B that the banana had been moved to the box (which B didn't know about), and now C is moving it back to the bag.

So B should know the banana is in the bag.

The correct answer to "what is in the bag?" is "banana." B witnessed C moving the banana from the box to the bag, so B should know this.

Since B already has the correct information, I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

1. B starts in the room, then leaves.
2. While B is outside: C leaves, then I put a ball in the box.
3. B enters the room - B doesn't know what happened while they were outside.

So B was **outside** when I put the ball in the box. B doesn't know what's in the box.

Action: Let me think through this carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a ball in the box.
- I put a banana in the basket.
- The bag is empty (nothing was put in it).

**What B knows:**
- B left the room initially, so B missed me putting the ball in the box.
- B re-entered the room, then C entered, then I put a banana in the basket (B saw this).
- Then I left the room.
- So B knows the basket has a banana, but B does NOT know what's in the box.

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the box. B doesn't know the answer since B was outside when I put the ball in the box.

I should tell B what's in the box so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The Tell action costs 0.5 points, but a correct answer gives 1 point, netting us +0.5.

1. B starts in the room with everyone.
2. B leaves the room.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag so I can tell B the correct answer.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. We all start in the room (A, B, C, D).
2. D puts a stapler in the bag.
3. B puts a banana in the basket.
4. I (A) leave the room.
5. B leaves the room.

When I left the room, the bag contained a stapler. However, after I left, things could have changed before B left. But B was still in the room after I left, so B would have seen any changes that happened between my departure and B's departure.

Wait - B was in the room when D put the stapler in the bag, and B was in the room until after I left. So B knows what was in the bag at least up until B left. B would know if anything changed to the bag while B was still in the room.

Since B was present for everything up until B left, B already knows the stapler was in the bag. The question is whether C or D changed the bag's contents after B left.

But I don't know what happened after I left the room. B knows what happened between my leaving and B's leaving, but neither of us knows what happened after B left.

Since B was in the room when the stapler was placed and would have seen any changes before leaving, B likely knows the bag contained a stapler when B left. The risk is that C and/or D changed the bag after B left.

However, B already has the same information I do about the bag (actually more, since B stayed longer). So telling B "stapler" might be redundant if nothing changed while I was gone but B was still there, and it won't help if something changed after B left.

But wait - I should consider: does B remember? B saw the stapler go in the bag. B would know this. The only risk is if something changed after B left. Neither of us can know that.

Since B already knows the stapler was in the bag (B was present when it happened), and neither of us knows if it changed after B left, a Tell action would cost 0.5 points without adding information B doesn't already have.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Action: The question will be asked to B about the bag's contents. Let me think about what B knows.

B was in the room when D put a stapler in the bag. B was also in the room when C put a brick in the basket. Then I left, then B left. 

However, after B left the room, C and D were still in the room. They could have moved objects around. But from B's perspective, B saw the stapler go into the bag, and nothing else happened to the bag before B left. So B should know the bag contains a stapler (as of when B left).

But wait - after both A and B left, C and D could have changed things. However, B wouldn't know about any changes after leaving. B's last knowledge is that the bag contains a stapler.

Since B was present when the stapler was put in the bag, B should already know the answer. There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

The key question is: did anything happen after B left? The scenario doesn't mention anything happening after B left, so the bag still contains the stapler. B knows this.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether B knows the answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. D puts a ball in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
3. I (A) leave the room. (From now on, I don't see what happens inside.)
4. B leaves the room. (I know B left.)
5. D leaves the room. (I know D left.)
6. D enters the room. (I know D entered.)
7. B enters the room. (I know B entered.)
8. B leaves the room. (I know B left.)

The key question: what happened while I was outside? After I left, B was still in the room with C and D. Then B left, then D left (leaving only C), then D came back (C and D in room), then B came back (B, C, D in room), then B left again.

While only C was in the room (after B and D left), C could have moved the ball out of the bag or swapped things around. Then when D re-entered, D and C could have done things. Then when B re-entered, B would have seen whatever happened while B was present, but B wouldn't know what C did while B was outside.

From B's perspective:
- B saw D put a ball in the bag initially.
- B left the room. While B was outside: D left, then D entered (B knows these movements but not what happened inside).
- B re-entered the room. While B was back in the room with C and D, B would see any actions. Then B left again.

B doesn't know what C did while B was outside (C was alone and could have moved the ball). So B might not know the current contents of the bag.

However, I also don't know what happened. The ball might still be in the bag, or C might have moved it. I have no way to know for certain.

Since I don't know the answer either, I can't reliably Tell B. But I could Ask C (who was in the room the entire time and knows everything). However, C is on the Red team and might lie.

The safest play: the ball was put in the bag, and it may or may not still be there. B was in the room at the end (before leaving), and if nothing happened while B was there, B wouldn't have new info. But B also doesn't know what happened while B was out.

I should tell B what I last knew - the ball is in the bag - since that's the best information available to our team. B might not remember or might be uncertain.

B answers: ball
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- I put a brick in the box.
- C was in the room when I put the brick in the box, so C knows the brick is in the box.
- C then left the room, followed by B leaving.
- After both left, nothing else happened (no objects were moved).

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the box.

**C's knowledge:** C saw me put the brick in the box. C left the room before B did. After C left, B left too, but nothing else happened. However, C doesn't know whether anything happened after they left - C only knows that B left the room at some point after them.

**C's incentive:** C is on the Red team. If C answers correctly (brick), Red gets 1 point. C knows the brick was in the box when they left. C might worry that something changed after they left, but since C saw B leave too (C is aware of people entering/leaving even when outside), C knows only I remained. C has no reason to think I moved the brick.

**My options:**
- I could **Tell C false information** to try to trick C into giving a wrong answer. For example, Tell(C, box, "ball") - but this costs 0.5 points, and C knows I'm on the opposing team, so C would likely not trust me and still answer "brick."
- I could **Pass** and save the 0.5 points, since C almost certainly knows the correct answer and won't be fooled by my deception.

Since C directly witnessed me putting the brick in the box, C has strong firsthand knowledge. Any Tell action from me (an opponent) would likely be distrusted by C. Spending 0.5 points to attempt a deception that's very unlikely to work is a bad trade.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a brick in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... B leaves the room. ...

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what C knows and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when I put a brick in the box. ✓ C knows the box has a brick.
2. C left the room.
3. After C left: B left, I put a stapler in the bag, D moved the stapler from bag to basket, I moved the stapler from basket to bag.

C knows the brick is in the box because C was present when I put it there. Nothing happened to the box after C left - the brick is still in the box.

So C will be asked what's in the box, and C knows it's a brick (since C saw me put it there and wasn't aware of any changes to the box after leaving). The brick is indeed still in the box.

C will likely answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point. 

Should I try to mislead C? I could Tell C false information about the box. But C saw me put the brick in the box, and C knows that I (an opponent) might lie. C would likely trust their own observation over my Tell action. In fact, telling C something might even confirm to C that the brick is still there (since I'd be trying to mislead them).

There's no benefit to spending 0.5 points on an action here. C already has the correct information from direct observation, and any Tell from me (an opponent) would likely be ignored or even backfire.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and whether I need to take any action.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when I put a brick in the box.
2. C then left the room.
3. After C left: B left, I put a banana in the bag, D moved banana from bag to basket, I moved banana from basket to bag, D moved banana from bag to basket.

C knows the brick was put in the box. After C left, nothing happened to the box - the brick is still there. So C should know the box contains a brick.

The question is: will C answer correctly? C is on the Red team, and answering correctly gives the Red team 1 point. So C is incentivized to answer correctly.

C saw the brick go into the box and left before anything else happened to the box. The brick is still in the box. C should answer "brick" correctly.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly here - C already knows the answer. Any Tell action to C would cost me 0.5 points and C has no reason to trust misinformation from me (an opponent). 

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and whether C knows it.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a stapler in the box. (Everyone sees: A, B, C, D)
2. C leaves the room. (C no longer sees what happens)
3. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (A, B, D see this; C doesn't)
4. B puts a banana in the box. (A, B, D see this; C doesn't)
5. D moves the banana from the box to the basket. (A, B, D see this; C doesn't)
6. B moves the stapler from the bag to the box. (A, B, D see this; C doesn't)
7. B leaves the room. (A, D remain)

Current state:
- Box: stapler
- Bag: empty
- Basket: banana

C's perspective: C left after step 1. At that point, the stapler was in the box. C doesn't know about any changes after that. So C likely thinks the box still contains the stapler.

The correct answer is **stapler** (it's currently in the box).

C will likely answer "stapler" because that's what was in the box when C left. Even though things moved around after C left, the stapler ended up back in the box.

So C will probably answer correctly on their own. Since C is on the Red team, I don't want them to get the point. But I can't prevent C from answering correctly - the question will be asked of C regardless.

There's nothing I can do to help my team here. Telling C wrong information would cost me 0.5 points, and C might not believe me anyway (I'm on the opposing team). C's natural belief (stapler) happens to be correct.

The best action is to Pass, since any action would cost 0.5 points and I can't influence C's answer in a way that benefits me.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- C put an apple in the basket (everyone saw this)
- B left the room
- After B left: C moved the apple from the basket to the bag, then put a stapler in the basket
- C left the room

**What C knows:**
C was present for all actions until they left. C knows:
- Bag contains: apple
- Basket contains: stapler

**What will C answer?**
The question is asking C what is in the basket. C knows the stapler is in the basket (C put it there). C will likely answer "stapler" which is correct, earning Red 1 point.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?**
I could Tell C false information about the basket, but C was in the room when they put the stapler in the basket and then left. C has no reason to believe anything changed after they left (though D is also outside the room, so no one else moved anything... wait, I'm still in the room). 

Actually, C left the room but I'm still in the room. C doesn't know if I moved things after they left. If I Tell C something different about the basket, C might doubt their knowledge... but probably not. C would likely trust their own memory over my potentially deceptive Tell.

The cost of a Tell is 0.5 points, and the chance of successfully deceiving C (who directly placed the stapler in the basket) is very low. C would rationally trust their own direct observation over a Tell from an opponent.

**Best action:** Pass. Spending 0.5 points on a deception that's very unlikely to work is not worth it.

Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what would be optimal here.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room initially. C put an apple in the basket.
2. B leaves the room (C sees this).
3. C moves the apple from the basket to the bag.
4. C puts a stapler in the basket.
5. C leaves the room.

After C left, D moved the apple around, and I moved the apple around, but the basket was never touched after C put the stapler in it. So the basket still contains the stapler.

From C's perspective: C last saw the basket containing a stapler when C left the room. C doesn't know what happened after leaving, but nothing actually changed in the basket.

So C will be asked what's in the basket. C knows (correctly) that the stapler is in the basket. C will likely answer "stapler" which would give the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C something false about the basket to try to trick C into giving a wrong answer. But C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). C saw the stapler placed in the basket right before leaving, so C would likely trust their own memory over my claim.

Alternatively, I could Tell B information for future rounds, but B doesn't know what happened after leaving. However, spending 0.5 points now might not be worth it.

Let me consider: if I Tell C that the basket contains something else (like the apple), C might be suspicious but probably won't believe me since C directly placed the stapler there. It would cost me 0.5 points and likely not change C's answer.

The best move is probably to Pass, since any action costs 0.5 points and is unlikely to trick C (who has direct knowledge of the basket contents).

Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through the scenario from each player's perspective:

**My perspective (A):** I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything:
- C puts apple in basket
- B leaves
- C moves apple from basket to bag
- C puts stapler in basket
- C leaves
- D moves apple from bag to box
- D moves apple from box to bag

Current state: bag=apple, box=empty, basket=stapler

**C's perspective:** C was present until they left. C saw:
- C puts apple in basket
- B leaves
- C moves apple from basket to bag
- C puts stapler in basket
- C leaves the room

After C left, D moved the apple around but it ended back in the bag. C doesn't know about D's moves, but from C's last knowledge:
- bag = apple
- basket = stapler
- box = empty

**The question is: What is in the basket?**

C will be asked what's in the basket. From C's perspective, C put a stapler in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that (from C's knowledge). So C should correctly answer **stapler**.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (earning Red 1 point), I need to consider if I can do anything to prevent this or if I should just Pass.

If I Tell C wrong information, C might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team. In fact, telling C false information could backfire or cost us 0.5 points for nothing. C has direct knowledge of putting the stapler in the basket and knows nothing happened to it after they left (from their perspective), so C would likely trust their own memory over anything I say.

The best action is to Pass and save our points, since C will likely answer correctly regardless of what I do, and spending 0.5 points on a deception that C would see through is wasteful.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would be optimal here.

**What I know (Player A):**
- I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything.
- Basket: stapler
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty

**What C knows:**
- C was present initially and saw the bag (empty), box (empty), basket (empty).
- C put a brick in the basket.
- C saw B leave the room.
- C moved the brick from the basket to the box.
- C put a stapler in the basket.
- C then left the room.
- After C left: D moved the stapler from basket to bag, then from bag back to basket.
- C does NOT know about D's movements after C left.

**So C believes:**
- Basket: stapler
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty

**The actual state:**
- Basket: stapler (D moved it out and back)
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty

So C's belief about the basket is that it contains the stapler, which happens to be correct (since D moved it out and back).

**The question is: What is in the basket?** Asked to C.

C will likely answer "stapler" based on what C last knew, and that answer is actually correct. So C's team (Red) would get 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C incorrect information to try to mislead them. Since C left the room and D did things after, C might believe that something changed. If I tell C something different about the basket, C might be misled.

However, C knows I'm on the opposing team, so C has reason to distrust me. But there's a chance C might second-guess themselves if I provide information suggesting something changed after they left.

Let me try to mislead C. I could tell C that the basket is empty (or contains something else), hoping C doubts their own knowledge. Since C knows D stayed in the room and could have moved things, C might be susceptible to doubt.

But C knows I'm on the Blue team and have incentive to lie. A sophisticated player would ignore my misinformation.

Still, the cost of a Tell is only 0.5 points, and if it causes C to answer incorrectly, Red loses 1 point they would have gained (a net swing of 1.5 points in our favor relative to the cost). It's worth the gamble.

I'll try to mislead C by telling them the basket is empty, suggesting D moved the stapler.

Tell(C, basket, empty)
C answers: empty
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

**What C knows:**

**The question:** C will be asked what's in the basket.

Since C is on the Red team, C saw the orange being placed in the basket, and C knows the answer is "orange." C will answer correctly and score 1 point for the Red team.

**My options:**
- **Pass:** Costs nothing. C will likely answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.
- **Tell(C, basket, [something wrong]):** I could try to deceive C by telling them something false about the basket. But C *saw* the orange go into the basket and was present for that. C would likely not believe my lie since they have direct knowledge. This would cost 0.5 points and probably not work.
- **Ask:** No useful purpose here.

C has direct firsthand knowledge of what's in the basket - they watched B put the orange in. Any attempt to deceive C would cost us 0.5 points and almost certainly fail, since C would trust their own eyes over my claim.

C was in the room when B put an orange in the basket. Then C left the room. After C left, the ball was moved around (box → bag → box), but the basket was never touched after C left. So the orange is still in the basket.

C saw B put the orange in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket before C left. So C should know the basket contains an orange.

Since C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the basket, and C actually knows the correct answer (orange), C will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for the Red team.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly - I can't communicate with C in a way that would help my team (telling C wrong information would cost me 0.5 points, and C has no reason to trust me since I'm on the opposing team). Even if I told C something false about the basket, C saw the orange being placed there and nothing else happened to the basket before C left, so C would likely trust their own memory.

Let me trace through what C saw before leaving the room:
- C was in the room when B put an orange in the basket.
- Then C left the room.
- After C left: B put a brick in the bag, I moved the brick to the box, B moved it back to the bag, I moved it back to the box.

C doesn't know about any of the brick movements, but C **does** know that the orange was put in the basket. Since nothing happened to the basket after that, the orange is still in the basket.

So C will be asked what's in the basket. C saw B put the orange in the basket and then left. Nothing happened to the basket after C left. So C knows the answer: **the orange is in the basket**.

Since C is on the Red team, if C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. 

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell C false information, but C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). C saw the orange go into the basket with their own eyes, so they'd likely trust their own observation over anything I tell them.

Spending 0.5 points to Tell C something false is risky - C would likely ignore my lie since they directly observed the orange being placed in the basket. I'd just be wasting 0.5 points.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Pass
C answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

You, B, and C are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a brick in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... You move the brick from the basket to the bag. ... B puts an apple in the basket. ... You move the apple from the basket to the box. ... B moves the brick from the bag to the basket. ...

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what C saw before leaving:
- C was in the room when B put a brick in the basket.
- Then C left the room.

After C left:
- I moved the brick from the basket to the bag.
- B put an apple in the basket.
- I moved the apple from the basket to the box.
- B moved the brick from the bag to the basket.

So the current state is:
- Bag: empty
- Box: apple
- Basket: brick

C last saw a brick go into the basket, and then left. C doesn't know about any changes after that. So C would likely guess the basket contains a **brick**.

The actual contents of the basket IS a brick (B moved it back). So C would answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

I should try to mislead C. I can Tell C false information about the basket to make C change their answer to something wrong.

If I tell C the basket contains something else, C might believe me (though C might be suspicious since I'm on the opposing team). However, C knows I'm on the Blue team and might not trust me.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. C saw the brick go in the basket. If I tell C something different, C might be suspicious because I'm an opponent. But if I say nothing, C will likely answer "brick" which is correct.

The risk: If I tell C false info, it costs 0.5 points AND C might ignore it (since I'm an opponent), resulting in a net -0.5 for us. If I pass and C answers correctly, Red gets +1.

But if my deception works, Red gets 0 and we only lose 0.5. That's better than Red getting 1 point.

Let me try to be clever. If I tell C the basket contains the apple, C might think I moved things around and the brick is no longer there. But C might also distrust me.

Alternatively, I could tell C the truth in a way that makes them doubt it... but that's risky.

I think the best play is to try to mislead C. I'll tell C the basket contains the apple, hoping C second-guesses their memory or believes things were moved.

Tell(C, basket, apple)
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what action would be most beneficial.

**What happened:**
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) in room. D puts brick in basket.
2. D leaves the room.
3. C moves brick from basket to bag. (D doesn't see this)
4. B puts stapler in basket. (D doesn't see this)
5. B leaves the room.

**Current state:**
- Bag: brick
- Basket: stapler
- Box: empty

**What D knows:**
- D saw themselves put a brick in the basket.
- D left the room, so D doesn't know about any changes after that.
- D will likely think the basket still contains the brick.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket.

D will probably answer "brick" (which is wrong - the basket actually has a stapler). This means Red team gets 0 points from this question, which is good for us.

**Should I take an action?**
- If I Tell D the truth (stapler in basket), that helps the Red team score 1 point - bad for us.
- If I Tell D a lie, D might already be wrong, so it could either help or hurt depending on what I say.
- D's teammate C is still in the room and saw everything. C knows the basket has a stapler. But C and D's actions are private too - C could Tell D the correct answer on C's turn.

Wait - C is still in the room with me. C saw everything and knows the basket has a stapler. On C's turn, C could Tell D the correct answer. So Red team might spend 0.5 points to tell D the truth.

I could try to preemptively Tell D wrong information to confuse them, but that costs us 0.5 points. If C then also tells D the truth, D has conflicting info and might not know who to trust. But D might trust teammate C over opponent A.

The best play is probably to **Pass** - D likely thinks it's a brick (wrong), and spending 0.5 points to interfere isn't worth it since C can correct D anyway and D would trust C over me.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team.

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: empty
- Box: brick
- Basket: stapler

**What does D know?**
D was in the room when the brick was put in the basket, then D left. After D left:
- C moved the brick from basket to bag
- B put a stapler in the basket
- B left the room
- I moved the brick from bag to box
- C moved the brick from box to bag
- I moved the brick from bag to box

D doesn't know about any of these changes. D only knows that B left the room (D can see people entering/leaving). D would think the basket still contains the brick.

**The question is: What is in the basket?**
The correct answer is: stapler.

D will likely answer "brick" (which is wrong), so Red team gets 0 points from this. That's good for my team.

**Should I act?**
- If I Tell D the truth (basket contains stapler), that costs 0.5 points but helps Red score 1 point, netting Red +1 and Blue -0.5. Bad for me.
- If I Tell D a lie, it costs 0.5 points and might keep D wrong. But D is already likely wrong.
- If I Pass, it costs nothing and D will probably answer "brick" (wrong). Good for Blue.

The optimal action is to Pass, since D is already likely to give the wrong answer.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would be optimal here.

**What D knows:**
- D was in the room when the brick was put in the basket.
- D then left the room.
- After leaving, D saw B leave the room, but D doesn't know about any movements of objects that happened after D left.
- So D believes: brick is in the basket (last D knew), and stapler's location is unknown to D.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket.

D will likely answer "brick" because that's what D last saw in the basket. But the basket actually contains the **stapler** (B put the stapler in the basket after D left, and it hasn't been moved since).

So D will probably answer "brick" which is **wrong**. That's good for my team (Blue).

**Should I take any action?**

- If I Pass, D will likely answer "brick" (wrong) → Red gets 0 points, Blue gets 0 points. No cost to us.
- If I Tell D the truth (basket contains stapler), D would get it right → Red gets 1 point, and it costs Blue 0.5 points. Terrible for us.
- If I Tell D something false, it costs 0.5 points and might not help.

D is on the Red team. D answering incorrectly is good for Blue. I should not help D at all.

The best action is to Pass and let D answer incorrectly.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team score.

**What's in the basket?** A stapler (B put it there after C moved the banana to the bag).

**What does D know?** D left the room after putting the banana in the basket. D doesn't know about any moves that happened after they left. So D thinks the banana is still in the basket. D will likely answer "banana" — which is **wrong**.

**Since D is on the Red team**, if D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points. That's good for us!

**Should I help D?** Absolutely not — D is on the opposing team. If D answers wrong, that benefits us.

**Could C help D?** C saw everything until B left. C saw B put the stapler in the basket. But C is still in the room, and it's my turn now, not C's. C might get a chance to tell D later, but right now it's my action.

**Should I mislead D?** I could Tell D something false to reinforce their wrong belief, but D already believes the banana is in the basket, which is wrong. Spending 0.5 points to reinforce an already-wrong belief isn't worth it.

**Should I tell D the truth?** No — that would help the Red team.

The best action is to Pass, saving our points and letting D answer incorrectly.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- D put an apple in the bag, then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the apple from the bag to the box and put a brick in the bag.
- D doesn't know about C's moves since D was outside the room.
- D thinks the apple is still in the bag.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

**D's perspective:** D saw themselves put an apple in the bag, then left. D knows B left after them, and C stayed in the room. D doesn't know what C did. However, C is D's teammate (both Red team), so C might have told D something, but no actions have been taken yet in the action phase.

**What will D likely answer?** D last saw the apple in the bag. Without any information, D would likely answer "apple." But the actual contents of the bag is a **brick**.

**My goal:** D is on the Red team. If D answers correctly (brick), Red gets a point. If D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point. I want D to answer incorrectly.

**Should I tell D something?** I could try to mislead D, but D might be suspicious of information from an opposing team member. However, if I tell D nothing, C (D's teammate) could use their turn to tell D the truth (that the bag contains a brick).

**Strategy:** If I pass, C might tell D the correct answer on C's turn. If I tell D false information, D has to weigh my info against what C might tell them. 

The best move might be to **Tell D the bag contains the apple** - this reinforces D's existing (wrong) belief. Even if C later tells D the truth, D will have conflicting information. But D would likely trust C (teammate) over me (opponent).

Alternatively, I could **Tell D the bag contains a brick** - this is the truth, but coming from an opponent, D might distrust it and stick with "apple." This is a reverse psychology play.

Actually, the most devious play: Tell D the truth (brick). D will think "why would an opponent help me?" and may distrust it, sticking with "apple" (the wrong answer). If C then also says "brick," D might think C is being tricked or might trust C. But if I say nothing, C simply tells D "brick" and D trusts their teammate.

I think telling D the truth is the best psychological play - it creates doubt even if C confirms it.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) in room. D puts apple in bag.
2. D leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. C moves apple from bag to box.
5. C puts brick in bag.
6. I move apple from box to basket.
7. I move apple from basket to box.

**Current state:** Bag has brick, Box has apple, Basket is empty.

**What D knows:** D put an apple in the bag, then left. D knows B left after them, but doesn't know what happened inside the room after leaving. D would believe the apple is still in the bag (unless someone tells D otherwise).

**The question is for D: "What is in the bag?"**

D will likely answer "apple" (their last known state of the bag). The correct answer is "brick."

Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer **incorrectly**. D currently believes the bag has an apple, which is wrong - great for my team!

However, I need to consider whether C (D's teammate) might tell D the truth on C's turn. C was in the room and saw everything - C knows the bag has a brick.

If I Pass now, C might use a Tell action to inform D that the bag contains a brick, costing Red 0.5 points but gaining 1 point (net +0.5 for Red).

Could I mislead D? If I Tell D something false, D might be suspicious since I'm on the opposing team. But if I tell D something that seems plausible...

Actually, the best play is to **Pass**. D currently has the wrong answer. If I try to Tell D anything, it might actually help them (if I tell truth) or they might distrust me anyway (if I lie). By passing, I save points and D still has the wrong belief. C might correct D, but that costs Red 0.5 points.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**My knowledge (Player A):** I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything:
- D put orange in box
- D left
- B moved orange from box to basket
- C moved orange from basket to box
- B left
- C moved orange from box to bag
- C put brick in box
- Current state: bag=orange, box=brick, basket=empty

**D's knowledge:** D put the orange in the box, then left. After leaving, D knows B left the room, but doesn't know what happened inside. D last saw: orange in box. D doesn't know about any moves after leaving.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the box. D last saw the orange placed in the box and then left. D likely thinks the box still contains the orange (though D knows B and C were in the room and could have moved things).

**Strategy:** D is on the Red team. If D answers correctly (brick), Red gets 1 point. If D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points. 

D will likely guess "orange" since that's what D put there. That would be wrong - the box actually contains a brick. This is good for my team.

Should I Tell D something? If I tell D the truth (box contains brick), D would answer correctly and Red scores. That's bad for us.

Should I tell D something false to reinforce their wrong belief? I could Tell D that the box contains the orange, reinforcing D's existing belief. But D already likely believes that, so it's a waste of 0.5 points.

Could I tell D something else false to confuse them? If D was going to say "orange" (wrong answer), any action I take either costs us 0.5 points or risks helping D.

The best action is to Pass - D will likely answer "orange" (which is wrong), and we don't spend any points.

Pass

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be most beneficial.

**What C knows:** C was in the room when they put an apple in the basket. Then C left the room. After C left, I moved the apple from the basket to the bag, and B put an orange in the basket. C is unaware of these changes since they happened after C left.

**What C will likely answer:** C will probably say the basket contains an apple (since that's the last thing C saw before leaving).

**The actual contents of the basket:** An orange (B put it there after I moved the apple to the bag).

**The question:** C will be asked what's in the basket. If C answers "apple," that's wrong (it's actually an orange). This means Red gets 0 points, which is good for us.

**Should I help C?** No! C is on the Red team. I want C to answer incorrectly.

**Should I try to mislead C?** If I Tell C something, it costs 0.5 points. C might or might not believe me. Let me consider:

- If I do nothing (Pass), C will likely say "apple" → wrong answer for Red → Red gets 0 points, we lose 0 points. Net: good for us.
- If I Tell C the truth (basket has orange), it costs us 0.5 points, and C might answer correctly getting Red 1 point. Net: very bad for us.
- If I Tell C something misleading, it costs 0.5 points. But C already has the wrong answer naturally, so misleading them further is unnecessary and costs us points.

The best action is to Pass, since C is already likely to give the wrong answer.

Pass
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room and put an apple in the basket.
2. C left the room.

After C left, C doesn't know about any changes. So C believes:
- Basket: apple
- Bag: empty
- Box: empty

But the actual state is:
- Basket: orange (B put it there)
- Box: apple (B moved it there last)
- Bag: empty

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to C.

C will likely answer "apple" because that's what C last saw in the basket. But the actual answer is "orange."

So C will answer incorrectly, which means Red gets 0 points. That's good for us.

Now, should I use a Tell action to try to mislead C? If I Tell C something, C might change their answer. But wait - C is on the Red team, so I want C to answer incorrectly. C is already going to answer incorrectly (saying "apple" when it's actually "orange").

If I Tell C the truth (that the basket contains an orange), C might answer correctly, giving Red a point. That would be bad.

If I Tell C something false, it could either:
- Keep C wrong (wasting 0.5 points)
- Or accidentally make C more confused

The best action is to Pass. C is already going to give the wrong answer, and any action I take either costs points or risks helping C.

Pass
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room and put an apple in the basket.
2. C left the room.
3. After C left: I moved the apple from basket to bag, B put an orange in the basket, I moved the apple from bag to box, then from box to bag.

C doesn't know about any of the movements after leaving. C last saw the apple in the basket, so C will likely answer "apple" for what's in the basket.

The actual contents of the basket: an orange (B put it there after C left).

So C will likely answer "apple" which is **wrong**. This is good for my team (Blue) since C is on the Red team - their wrong answer means they don't get a point.

I should Pass, since there's no benefit to helping C answer correctly, and C is likely to get it wrong on their own.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would be optimal here.

**What C knows:**
- C was in the room when they put a banana in the basket.
- C then left the room.
- After leaving, C would have seen D leave the room, but C doesn't know about any object movements that happened after they left.

So C believes: banana is in the basket (that's the last thing C saw before leaving).

**What's actually in the basket:** an orange (B put it there after D left).

**The question:** C will be asked what's in the basket. C will likely answer "banana" based on their knowledge. The correct answer is "orange," so C will be **wrong**. This is good for us - Red gets 0 points.

Since C is on the Red team and will answer incorrectly based on their own knowledge, I don't need to do anything. There's no benefit to helping C (they're on the opposing team), and spending 0.5 points to Tell or Ask would just cost us.

However, I should consider if D might try to Tell C something. But it's my turn right now, not D's turn. D also left the room before the banana was moved to the box and before the orange was placed, so D doesn't know the current state either.

The best action is to Pass - C will likely answer "banana" (wrong), costing Red a point opportunity, and we save our 0.5 points.

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what C knows about the basket.

Let me trace through C's perspective:

1. C is in the room initially. D puts an apple in the basket. C sees this.
2. C leaves the room.
3. While C is outside: D moves the apple from the basket to the bag. C does NOT see this.
4. C enters the room.
5. D puts an orange in the basket. C sees this.
6. A (me) leaves the room.
7. B leaves the room.

So C knows:
- An apple was put in the basket (step 1)
- C left and came back (steps 2-4) - C missed the apple being moved to the bag
- D puts an orange in the basket (step 5) - C sees this

Now, C saw the orange being put in the basket. C knows the orange is in the basket.

The actual contents of the basket: The apple was moved out, then an orange was put in. So the basket contains an orange.

C knows the basket contains an orange (C saw D put the orange in the basket after returning).

So C will likely answer "orange" which is correct. This means the Red team will get 1 point.

Since C has the correct information, there's nothing I can do with a Tell action to help my team. I could try to mislead C with a Tell action, but let me think about whether that's worth 0.5 points.

If I Tell C that the basket contains something else (like the apple), C might get confused. But C directly saw D put the orange in the basket, so C is unlikely to believe me over their own observation. Spending 0.5 points to attempt a deception that probably won't work seems wasteful.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a ball in the bag. (A, B, and C all see this)
2. C puts a brick in the box. (A, B, and C all see this)
3. I move the brick from the box to the basket. (A, B, and C all see this)
4. B moves the brick from the basket to the box. (A, B, and C all see this)
5. I leave the room.

So at the point I leave, the bag contains a ball, the box contains a brick, and the basket is empty.

C is still in the room and saw everything that happened while I was there. C knows the bag contains a ball.

Now, after I left the room, something might have happened that I'm not aware of. But the scenario as described to me only shows "..." after I leave, with no mention of anyone entering or leaving (I would be told about entries/exits even while outside).

Since nothing else happened after I left (no one entered or left), the bag still contains a ball. C was present for everything and knows the bag contains a ball.

C is on the Red team, so C will be asked what's in the bag. C knows it's a ball. C gets 1 point for the Red team if they answer correctly.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from knowing the correct answer - C directly witnessed me putting the ball in the bag and was present the entire time. Any Tell action with false information would cost us 0.5 points and C would have no reason to believe it over their own observation.

The best action is to Pass, saving the 0.5 points since I can't change what C knows.

Action: I need to think about what C knows about the bag.

Let me trace through C's perspective:

1. C is in the room when I put an orange in the bag. **C sees this.**
2. C leaves the room. **C doesn't see what happens next.**
3. I move the orange from the bag to the box. **C doesn't see this.**
4. C enters the room. **C now sees the room again.**
5. I put a brick in the bag. **C sees this.**
6. I leave the room.

Now, from C's perspective:
- C saw me put an orange in the bag initially.
- C left and came back.
- When C came back, C saw me put a brick in the bag.
- C did NOT see me move the orange from the bag to the box.

So C might think the bag contains both an orange and a brick? No wait - each container holds at most one object. So C saw me put a brick in the bag. C knows containers hold at most one object.

Actually, C might reason: "The bag had an orange, then A put a brick in the bag. Since containers hold at most one object, the orange must have been moved out at some point while I was gone." So C would know the bag currently contains a brick.

Alternatively, C might be confused, but the most logical conclusion for C is that the bag contains a brick (since that's the last thing put in it, and containers can only hold one object).

Since C is on the Red team and I want C to answer **incorrectly**, I should consider whether C will get this right. C likely knows the bag contains a brick, which is correct.

I could try to Tell C false information to mislead them. Let me tell C something misleading about the bag.

Tell(C, bag, orange)

This might make C second-guess themselves, thinking maybe the brick was moved out after I left (though nothing happened after I left that C would know about). Actually, C saw me put the brick in the bag and then I just left - C is still in the room and would know nothing else happened. So C would likely not believe me.

Hmm, but it costs 0.5 points. The potential gain is that C answers wrong (saving Red 1 point). Let me try to mislead C.

Tell(C, bag, orange)
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a banana in the basket. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... C moves the banana from the basket to the bag. ... D moves the banana from the bag to the basket. ... You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events from my perspective:

1. **I'm in the room with B, C, D.** I see D put a banana in the basket.
2. **I leave the room.** I can't see what happens inside, but I know who enters/leaves.
3. **I enter the room.** I can now see what happens again.
4. **C moves the banana from the basket to the bag.** I see this.
5. **D moves the banana from the bag to the basket.** I see this.
6. **I leave the room.** I can no longer see what happens inside.
7. **B leaves the room.** I know B left.

So at the point I left the room the second time, the banana was in the basket. After I left, B was still in the room briefly before leaving. During that time (between my leaving and B leaving), something could have happened that I wouldn't know about. But the scenario only describes B leaving - no object movements are described during that window.

However, I need to be careful: the scenario describes what I **see**. If something happened while I was outside the room, it wouldn't be described to me. Between "You leave the room" and "B leaves the room," C and D were still in the room and could have moved things.

So from my perspective, the last I knew, the banana was in the basket. But C and D could have moved it after I left.

B was in the room until they left, so B would know if anything happened after I left. Let me ask B what's in the basket.

Ask(B, basket)
A answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. C puts a ball in the box.
2. I leave the room. (Things might happen while I'm gone that I don't know about.)
3. I enter the room. (I can now see what happens again.)
4. C moves the ball from the box to the basket. (I see this.)
5. D moves the ball from the basket to the box. (I see this.)
6. I leave the room. (Things might happen while I'm gone that I don't know about.)

So after step 5, the ball is in the box. Then I leave the room. I don't know what happened after I left.

Since I'm outside the room now and things could have changed after I left, I'm uncertain about the current contents of the box. B was in the room the entire time (the scenario never mentions B leaving), so B should know the current state of the box.

Let me ask B what's in the box. This costs 0.5 points but gives me the correct answer worth 1 point, netting 0.5 points.

Ask(B, box)
A answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the basket.

Let me trace through what B saw before leaving the room:
1. Everyone starts in the room.
2. C puts a banana in the basket. (B saw this)
3. B leaves the room.

After B left:
- D leaves the room.
- I put a ball in the box.
- C moves the ball from the box to the bag.
- I move the ball from the bag to the box.

The basket still has the banana in it - nothing changed about the basket after B left.

So B saw C put a banana in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that. B should know the basket contains a banana.

Since B already knows the correct answer (banana is in the basket), I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: banana

1. B was in the room when C put a banana in the basket. ✓ B knows the basket has a banana.
2. Then B left the room.
3. After B left, various things happened with the ball, bag, and box - but nothing happened to the basket.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. All containers are empty.
2. C puts an orange in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens inside.)
4. C moves the orange from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this.)
5. D puts a brick in the basket. (B doesn't see this.)
6. C moves the brick from the basket to the box. (B doesn't see this.)
7. D moves the orange from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this.)
8. D leaves the room.

So the current state is:
- Basket: orange
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty

B's knowledge (since B left after step 2):
- B last saw: orange in the basket, bag empty, box empty.
- B knows that B left, then D left later.
- B doesn't know about any moves after leaving.

So B would guess the basket contains the orange, which happens to be correct! The orange is indeed in the basket right now.

Wait - B would answer "orange" for the basket, and the basket actually contains the orange. So B would answer correctly without my help!

But I should be careful. B might not be confident and could guess wrong. However, B's best knowledge is that the orange was in the basket when B left, and B might reason that things could have changed. But B's most logical answer would be "orange."

Since B's natural answer (orange) is correct, I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B. I'll pass.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can answer correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room initially and saw me put a stapler in the box.
2. D left the room (B was still inside).
3. B moved the stapler from the box to the bag (B knows this).
4. C put a banana in the box (B was still in the room and saw this).
5. B left the room.

So B saw everything that happened. B knows:
- The box contains a banana (C put it there after B moved the stapler to the bag)
- The bag contains the stapler

B should know the correct answer to "what is in the box?" — it's a banana.

Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether I should help B answer correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. Everyone starts in the room. I put a stapler in the box. (B sees this)
2. D leaves the room. (B sees this)
3. B moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (B does this)
4. C puts a banana in the box. (B sees this)
5. B leaves the room. (B leaves at this point)

After B leaves:
6. I move the stapler from the bag to the basket.
7. C moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.
8. I move the stapler from the bag to the basket.

So from B's perspective, the last thing B saw before leaving was:
- Box: banana (C put it there)
- Bag: stapler (B moved it there)
- Basket: empty

The question is "what is in the box?" and B will be asked.

B last saw a banana being put in the box. After B left, nothing happened to the box - the movements were all about the stapler moving between bag and basket. So the box still contains the banana.

B should know the answer is "banana" based on what B observed. B saw C put the banana in the box, and B has no reason to think it moved (since B left and wouldn't know about any changes, but in fact no changes happened to the box).

Since B already knows the correct answer (banana), I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B.

B answers: banana

7. C moves stapler from bag to basket. → Bag=empty, basket=stapler. A, C see this.
8. I move stapler from basket to bag. → Basket=empty, bag=stapler. A, C see this.
9. C moves stapler from bag to basket. → Bag=empty, basket=stapler. A, C see this.

Current state: Box=banana, bag=empty, basket=stapler.

B's knowledge (B left after step 5): B last saw box=banana, bag=stapler, basket=empty. B doesn't know about steps 7-9.

**The question is: What is in the box?** The answer is **banana**.

B knows the box has a banana from step 5 (B was present when C put the banana in the box). So B should correctly answer "banana" without any help from me.

Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a ball in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the ball from the bag to the box. ... C puts a banana in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the ball from the box to the basket. ... C moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... C moves the banana from the box to the bag. ...

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. I put a ball in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. B moves the ball from the bag to the box. (A, B, C see this)
5. C puts a banana in the bag. (A, B, C see this)
6. B leaves the room.
7. C moves the ball from the box to the basket. (Only A and C see this)
8. C moves the banana from the bag to the box. (Only A and C see this)
9. C moves the banana from the box to the bag. (Only A and C see this)

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: ball

**What B knows (from when B was in the room):**
- Ball was put in bag, then moved to box
- Banana was put in bag
- B left the room after step 5

So B last saw:
- Bag: banana
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

B doesn't know about the moves C made after B left. So B would think the bag contains a **banana**.

The actual contents of the bag is a **banana** (after C moved it back).

So B's knowledge actually aligns with the correct answer! B would likely answer "banana" which is correct.

However, B might be uncertain since things could have changed after B left. To be safe, I should confirm to B what's in the bag so B answers confidently and correctly.

Tell(B, bag, banana)
B answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me analyze what B knows:
- B was in the room when I put the orange in the bag.
- B then left the room.
- After B left, various movements happened with the banana (box → basket → box → basket), but nothing happened to the bag.

So B knows the orange is in the bag, since B saw me put it there and nothing happened to the bag after B left.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" directed at B.

The bag still contains the orange (nothing was moved out of the bag during the scenario). B saw me put the orange in the bag and has no reason to think it was moved. So B should correctly answer "orange."

Since B already knows the correct answer, there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B anything.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

I am going to ask B what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and tell B, since B will be asked.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a brick in the box. (B, C, D all see this)
2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. C moves the brick from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. D puts an orange in the box. (B doesn't see this)
5. C moves the orange from the box to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
6. D moves the brick from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)

So the current state:
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty
- Basket: orange

B last saw the brick being put in the box (step 1), and then left. B doesn't know about any changes after that. B would guess the box still contains the brick.

The box currently contains the brick, which happens to be what B would guess anyway. So B would likely answer "brick" correctly without my help.

However, there's a risk that C or D might use a Tell action to mislead B into thinking something else is in the box. Since it's my turn now, I should consider whether to spend 0.5 points to tell B the truth (which B already believes), or pass and save the points.

If I pass, B likely answers "brick" correctly (earning 1 point, net +1). If I tell B, B answers correctly (earning 1 point, but costing 0.5, net +0.5).

But C and D each get turns before B answers. They could try to deceive B. If C or D tells B something false like "the box contains an orange," B might be confused since B knows C and D are opponents and might be lying. But B might also doubt their own knowledge since they left the room.

I think the safest play is to tell B the correct answer, reinforcing what B already believes, so that even if C or D try to mislead B, B has confirmation from a trusted teammate.

Tell(B, box, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what I should do.

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone was in the room. I put an orange in the bag.
2. B left the room.
3. After B left: C moved the orange from the bag to the box, and C put an apple in the bag.
4. D left the room.

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put an orange in the bag.
- B then left the room, so B does NOT know about C's actions.
- B thinks the bag still contains the orange.

**What's actually in the bag:**
- An apple (C put it there after moving the orange to the box).

**The question will be asked to B: "What is in the bag?"**
- B will likely answer "orange" based on their last knowledge, but the correct answer is "apple."
- B answering incorrectly means Blue gets 0 points.

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

B left after seeing me put the orange in the bag. B doesn't know about any changes after that. So B would think the bag still contains the orange. B would answer "orange" which is **wrong** - the bag actually contains an apple.

- D put a stapler in the box
- C left the room
- B left the room
- D moved the stapler from the box to the bag

- So the box currently contains a **brick**

**B:** B saw D put a stapler in the box, then B left the room. B did NOT see D move the stapler to the bag or put a brick in the box. So B thinks the box contains a **stapler**.

**C:** C saw D put a stapler in the box, then C left the room. C doesn't know about subsequent changes.

**D:** D knows everything since D stayed in the room. D knows the box contains a **brick**.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the box?" B thinks it's a stapler, but the correct answer is a brick. I need to tell B the correct answer so our team gets the point.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and whether B knows the answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts a stapler in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
3. C leaves the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (Only A and D see this.)
6. D puts a brick in the box. (Only A and D see this.)
7. I (A) move the stapler from the bag to the basket. (Only A and D see this.)
8. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (Only A and D see this.)

So the current state is:
- Bag: stapler
- Box: brick
- Basket: empty

B left the room after step 2, so B only knows that D put a stapler in the box. B doesn't know about any changes after that. B would think the box contains a stapler, but the correct answer is **brick**.

I need to tell B what's in the box so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Tell(B, box, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts a ball in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. D moves the ball from the box to the basket. (Only A and D see this)
6. D moves the ball from the basket to the box. (Only A and D see this)
7. D moves the ball from the box to the bag. (Only A and D see this)
8. D puts a brick in the box. (Only A and D see this)

So the current state is:
- Bag: ball
- Box: brick
- Basket: empty

B left the room after seeing D put a ball in the box. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B thinks the box still contains the ball.

I will be asked about what B thinks is in the box. Wait, no - the question is directed at B. B will be asked what is in the box.

B believes the box contains a **ball** (since B left before any moves happened). The actual answer is **brick**.

If I don't tell B, B will answer "ball" which is wrong - Blue gets 0 points.
If I tell B the correct answer (brick), it costs 0.5 points but B can answer correctly for 1 point, netting +0.5 points.

So I should tell B what's actually in the box.

Tell(B, box, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out the best action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** The basket currently contains a brick. The bag contains the stapler. The box is empty. I saw everything because I was in the room the whole time.

**What B knows:** B saw me put the stapler in the basket initially. Then B left the room. B doesn't know about D moving the stapler to the bag or D putting a brick in the basket. So B thinks the basket still contains the stapler.

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the basket. The correct answer is **a brick**.

B will likely answer "stapler" based on their outdated information, which would be **wrong**. I need to tell B the correct contents of the basket.

Tell(B, basket, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the bag.

Let me trace through B's perspective:
1. B is in the room when I put a brick in the bag. B knows: bag has brick.
2. B leaves the room. B doesn't see C move the brick from bag to box.
3. B is outside when C moves the brick from bag to box. B doesn't know this happened.
4. B enters the room. B doesn't see C move the brick from box to bag (this happens while B is in the room... wait, let me re-read.

Let me re-read carefully:
1. A, B, C are in the room. A puts brick in bag. (All see this)
2. B leaves the room.
3. C moves brick from bag to box. (B doesn't see this)
4. B enters the room.
5. C moves brick from box to bag. (B sees this! B is in the room now)
6. C leaves the room.

Wait - when B enters the room, then C moves the brick from box to bag. B sees this action. So B sees the brick being moved from the box to the bag.

So B knows:
- Originally brick was in bag
- B left and came back
- After returning, B saw C move brick from box to bag

So B knows the brick is in the bag.

The question is: what is in the bag? The answer is the brick. B saw C move the brick from the box to the bag, so B knows the brick is in the bag.

B should answer correctly on their own. I don't need to spend points telling B something they already know.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

**What B knows:**
B was in the room the entire time, so B saw everything. B knows:
- Bag: apple

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the bag.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask B what is in the bag."

So B will be asked what is in the bag. B was present for all events, so B knows the bag contains an apple. B will answer "apple" and our team gets 1 point.

Since B has full knowledge of what happened (B was in the room the whole time and saw me move the brick to the box and put the apple in the bag), B will correctly answer "apple."

Action: Looking at this situation, I need to figure out if B knows what's in the bag.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a brick in the bag.
3. D leaves the room.
4. C leaves the room.

8. B moves the brick from the basket to the box.
9. I move the brick from the box to the basket.
10. B moves the brick from the basket to the box.

B was in the room the entire time, so B witnessed everything. B saw me put the apple in the bag in step 6. After that, the bag was never touched again - only the brick was moved around between the box and basket.

So B knows the bag contains an apple. B will answer correctly.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a stapler in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the box to the basket. ... B enters the room. ... C moves the stapler from the basket to the box. ... D leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... You move the stapler from the box to the bag. ... You put an apple in the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what B knows:

1. B puts a stapler in the box (B knows: box has stapler)
2. B leaves the room
3. D moves stapler from box to basket (B doesn't see this)
4. B enters the room (B doesn't know about the move)
5. C moves stapler from basket to box (B sees this - B now knows stapler is in box, basket is empty)
6. D leaves the room (B sees this)
7. C leaves the room (B sees this)
8. B is still in the room... wait, let me re-read.

Wait - "D leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... You move the stapler from the box to the bag. ... You put an apple in the box."

Is B in the room when I do these actions? Let me re-check: B entered the room and I don't see B leaving again. So B is in the room when I move the stapler from the box to the bag and put an apple in the box.

So B saw everything after re-entering:
- C moves stapler from basket to box
- D leaves
- C leaves
- I move stapler from box to bag
- I put apple in box

B knows the box contains an apple.

The question is: "I am going to ask B what is in the box."

B knows the answer is **apple**. B was present when I put the apple in the box.

So B should answer correctly without any help from me. I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: Looking at this situation, I need to figure out if B knows what's in the bag.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. D puts an orange in the bag - B was in the room, so B saw this.
2. D puts an apple in the box - B was in the room, so B saw this.
3. B moves the apple from the box to the basket - B did this themselves.
4. I move the apple from the basket to the box - B was in the room, so B saw this.

So B knows everything that happened:
- **Bag**: orange
- **Box**: apple
- **Basket**: empty

B already knows the bag contains an orange. No need to spend points telling B something they already know.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... B enters the room. ... D puts a banana in the box. ...

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can answer correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room when D put a stapler in the box.
2. B left the room.
3. While B was outside: D moved the stapler from the box to the bag.
4. B entered the room.
5. B saw D put a banana in the box.

So B saw the stapler go into the box initially, then left. When B came back, B saw D put a banana in the box. 

B knows the banana was put in the box (B witnessed this). So B should know the box contains a banana.

Wait - but does B know the stapler was moved out? B left before the stapler was moved. When B returned, B saw D put a banana in the box. B might think the box has both items, but containers can only hold one object. Actually, B might think the stapler is still in the box and then a banana was put in - but since containers hold at most one object, B might be confused about what happened to the stapler.

Actually, the key question: does B know containers can hold at most one object? Yes, this is a rule of the game. So B knows the box can only hold one object. B saw the stapler put in the box, left, came back, and saw a banana put in the box. B would reason that either the stapler was removed at some point while B was away (which it was), or the banana replaced it. Either way, B should conclude the box now contains the banana.

So B should be able to answer "banana" correctly. I'll Pass to save points.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and tell B, since B will be asked about it.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. Bag, box, basket are all empty.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D puts a ball in the basket.
4. I put a banana in the bag.
5. D moves the banana from the bag to the box.
6. I move the banana from the box to the bag.
7. I leave the room.

B left the room before anything was placed in containers, so B doesn't know what's in any container. After I left, something might have happened, but I wouldn't know about it.

At the time I left the room:
- Basket: ball
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty

However, after I left, C and D are still in the room and could have moved things. I don't know if anything changed after I left. But based on what I last saw, the basket contains a ball.

Since B has no information about the basket's contents (B left before anything happened), I should tell B what I know.

The risk is that C or D moved things after I left, but I have to go with my best information.

Tell(B, basket, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

So at the point I left, the state was:

- Bag: empty

B left before anything happened, so B doesn't know what's in any container. B needs to know the basket contains a ball.

After I left the room, C and D are still in the room, so something could have changed. But based on what I know, the basket has a ball in it.

I should tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the basket and whether I need to help.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D puts an orange in the basket. (B is outside, so B doesn't see this. I'm inside, so I see it.)
4. I leave the room.
5. C leaves the room.
6. C enters the room. (C is now in the room alone - I don't know what happens inside.)
7. B enters the room. (B is now in the room, possibly with C - I don't know what happens inside.)
8. B leaves the room.

So B didn't see the orange being placed in the basket. When B entered the room (step 7), B could see what's happening but not inside containers. B can't see inside the basket, so B wouldn't know what's in it unless someone told B or B saw something being placed/removed.

The key question: Did anything happen to the basket between when I left and when B entered? C was in the room alone for a while, and C could have moved the orange. But I don't know what C did.

However, I do know that the orange was placed in the basket, and I should tell B this information. The risk is that C (who was alone in the room) might have moved the orange out of the basket. But I have no evidence that happened, and the most likely correct answer based on what I know is "orange."

If C moved the orange, then telling B "orange" would be wrong and cost us 0.5 points. But if C didn't move it, telling B "orange" would help us gain 1 point (net +0.5). Since I have no specific reason to believe C moved it (C could have, but might not have), and the expected value favors telling B, I should tell B.

Tell(B, basket, orange)
B answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- I put a ball in the box.
- Everyone (A, B, C, D) was in the room when I put the ball in the box, so everyone saw it.
- Then B left, then D left.
- Nothing else happened after I put the ball in the box.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the box.

**What D knows:** D was in the room when I put the ball in the box, so D knows the box contains a ball. D left the room after that, but nothing happened to the box after D left (only D leaving happened after B left, and nothing else is described).

So D knows the correct answer: the box contains a ball. D will be asked this question, and since D is on the Red team, D will answer correctly and Red will get 1 point.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?** 

I could Tell D false information, like Tell(D, box, "shoe") to try to confuse D. But D saw me put the ball in the box, so D knows what's actually there. D would likely ignore my lie since D has direct knowledge.

I could also try telling D something to make them doubt, but D directly observed the ball being placed in the box and nothing happened after that while D was still in the room. D has no reason to doubt their own observation.

Any Tell or Ask action would cost my team 0.5 points and is unlikely to change D's answer since D has direct firsthand knowledge.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points on a futile attempt to deceive D.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a ball in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... C puts a brick in the bag. ... You move the brick from the bag to the basket. ... C moves the brick from the basket to the bag. ...

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the right answer is.

**Current state of the room:**
- Box: ball (I put it there, and it was never moved)
- Bag: brick (C moved it back there)
- Basket: empty

**What D knows:**
- D was in the room when I put the ball in the box.
- D left the room before C put the brick in the bag and before any subsequent moves.
- So D knows the box contains a ball.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the box.

D was present when I put the ball in the box, and the ball was never moved from the box. D should know the answer is "ball."

Since D is on the Red team and will be asked the question, if D answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point. I don't want that.

However, I can't prevent D from answering correctly since D directly witnessed me putting the ball in the box. Any Tell action to D with false information would cost me 0.5 points, and D has no reason to trust me (an opponent) over their own direct observation.

I could try to Tell D false information, but D saw me put the ball in the box with their own eyes. They'd likely ignore my lie. That would cost us 0.5 points for nothing.

The best action is to Pass, saving the 0.5 points since there's nothing I can effectively do to change D's correct knowledge.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what I should do.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What happened:**
1. A (me), B, C, D are all in the room. I put a ball in the box.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. C puts a stapler in the bag.
5. I move the stapler from bag to basket.
6. C moves the stapler from basket to bag.
7. I move the stapler from bag to basket.

**What D knows:**
- D was in the room when I put the ball in the box (step 1).
- D left the room at step 3.
- After leaving, D only knows that no one else entered or left the room.
- D has no information about any changes to containers after leaving.

So D knows the ball is in the box (since D saw me put it there), and nothing happened to the box after that. The ball is still in the box.

**The question is: What is in the box?**
The answer is: ball. D saw me put the ball in the box, and nothing changed about the box after that.

D should know the correct answer (ball), so D should answer correctly. But D is on the Red team, so if D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell D wrong information, but D saw me put the ball in the box with their own eyes. D would likely not believe a lie from me (an opposing team member) that contradicts what they directly observed.

Spending 0.5 points to Tell D false information would cost my team 0.5 points and D would almost certainly ignore it since they directly witnessed the ball being placed in the box. That would put us at -0.5 while Red gets +1.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points on a futile deception attempt.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what D knows and what the right answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. I put a brick in the bag.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room. At this point, D knows: brick is in the bag (that's the last thing D saw before leaving).
4. After D leaves: C moves brick from bag to box, puts banana in bag, moves banana from bag to basket, moves brick from box to bag.

So the **actual** contents of the bag: **brick** (it ended up back in the bag).

D's knowledge: D last saw the brick placed in the bag, then left. D doesn't know about any of C's movements. So D would naturally think the brick is still in the bag.

Since D will be asked what's in the bag, and D thinks the brick is in the bag, and the brick actually IS in the bag (after all of C's shuffling), D will likely answer "brick" — which is correct!

This means D's team (Red) will get 1 point if D answers correctly. I should consider whether I can mislead D.

If I Tell D something false, like "the bag contains a banana," D might believe me or might not. But D saw me put the brick in the bag and then left. D knows I'm on the opposing team, so D might not trust me. Spending 0.5 points to Tell D false information is risky — if D doesn't believe me, we lose 0.5 points for nothing. If D does believe me, D would answer "banana" (wrong), and Red gets 0 points, but we spent 0.5.

The question is: will D trust me? Since I'm on the opposing team, D should be skeptical. D's own memory says brick is in the bag. A lie from an opponent probably won't override that.

The expected value of telling a lie: if D believes me (unlikely, say 20%), we lose 0.5 but prevent Red from scoring 1 point (net +0.5 for us relatively). If D doesn't believe me (80%), we just lose 0.5 points.

Expected value: 0.2 * (+0.5) + 0.8 * (-0.5) = 0.1 - 0.4 = -0.3. Not worth it.

Pass
D answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a banana in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the banana from the box to the bag. ... C puts a ball in the box. ... C leaves the room. ...

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What C saw:**
- D puts a banana in the box (C was in the room)
- B leaves the room (C was in the room)
- D moves the banana from the box to the bag (C was in the room)
- C puts a ball in the box (C did this)
- C leaves the room

So C knows that when she left, the ball was in the box. After C left, nothing else happened to the box. So C knows the box contains a ball.

**The actual state:** The box contains a ball, the bag contains a banana.

Since C will be asked what's in the box, and C knows a ball is in the box (C put it there and nothing happened after that while C was in the room, and C left last among the events), C should answer "ball" which is correct. That would give Red 1 point.

I can't prevent C from answering correctly since C has direct knowledge. There's no benefit to me using Tell or Ask here - any Tell to C would cost us 0.5 points and C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team), and C already knows the correct answer anyway.

I should Pass to avoid spending points.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through what C observed:
1. C was in the room when D put a banana in the box.
2. C was in the room when B left.
3. C was in the room when D moved the banana from the box to the bag.
4. C was in the room when C put a ball in the box.
5. C then left the room.

After C left:
- D moved the banana from the bag to the basket.
- I moved the banana from the basket to the bag.
- D moved the banana from the bag to the basket.

C doesn't know about any of these later movements, but the question is about the box. From C's perspective, C put a ball in the box, and nothing happened to the box after that (from C's knowledge). So C should believe the box contains a **ball**.

And in reality, the box still contains a ball (nobody moved the ball out of the box - all the later movements involved the banana).

So C should correctly answer "ball" for what's in the box. That means the Red team will get 1 point if C answers correctly.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C wrong information to confuse them, but C was in the room when they put the ball in the box, so C has direct knowledge. C would likely trust their own memory over my tell, especially since I'm on the opposing team.

Trying to mislead C would cost 0.5 points and is unlikely to work since C has firsthand knowledge. The best action is to Pass.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through the scenario from C's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room.
2. D puts a banana in the box. (C sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (C sees this)
4. D moves the banana from the box to the bag. (C sees this)
5. C puts a ball in the box. (C does this)
6. C leaves the room. (C is now outside)
7. After C leaves: I move the banana from bag to basket, then basket to bag, then D moves banana from bag to basket.

So from C's perspective, when C left the room:
- **Box**: ball (C put it there)
- **Bag**: banana (D moved it there)
- **Basket**: empty

The question is: "What is in the box?"

From C's perspective, the last thing C knew about the box was that C put a ball in it. So C would likely answer "ball."

The actual current state of the box is: **ball** (nobody moved the ball after C put it there).

So C should correctly answer "ball" without any help from me. The answer C would naturally give is correct.

I should Pass to save points.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and what the right answer is, then decide if I should help C (Red team) or not.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone starts in the room. D puts orange in box.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves orange from box to bag. (A, C, D see this)
4. C puts ball in box. (A, C, D see this)
5. C leaves the room.
6. After C leaves: D moves orange from bag to basket, D moves ball from box to bag, D moves ball from bag to box.

So the current state is:
- Bag: empty
- Box: ball
- Basket: orange

C's perspective: C last saw the room when they left. At that point:
- Box: ball (C put it there)
- Bag: orange (D moved it there)
- Basket: empty

After C left, D made several moves that C doesn't know about. So C thinks the box has a **ball** in it.

The actual contents of the box: **ball**.

So C's belief (ball) matches reality (ball). C will likely answer "ball" correctly, earning Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C wrong information to mislead them. For example, I could tell C that the box contains something else, like the orange. Since C knows I was in the room the whole time, C might trust me. But it costs 0.5 points.

If I Tell C the box contains "orange," C might believe me and answer "orange" (wrong), costing Red 0 points and costing Blue 0.5 points. Net result: Blue at -0.5, Red at 0.

If I Pass, C will likely answer "ball" (correct), giving Red 1 point. Net result: Blue at 0, Red at 1.

So telling C wrong info: Blue -0.5, Red 0 (Blue is 0.5 behind).
Passing: Blue 0, Red 1 (Blue is 1 behind).

It's better to lose 0.5 points than to let Red gain 1 point. I should try to mislead C.

I'll tell C the box contains the orange (a lie), hoping C trusts me since I was in the room the whole time and saw everything after C left.

Tell(C, box, orange)
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- C put a banana in the box while everyone (A, B, C, D) was in the room.
- Then D left the room.
- Nothing else happened after D left.

**What D knows:**
- D saw C put a banana in the box (D was in the room at that time).
- D then left the room, and nothing happened after that which D wouldn't know about.

So D knows the box contains a banana. D will be asked what's in the box, and since D is on the Red team, D will answer correctly and score 1 point for Red.

**Should I take an action?**
- I could Tell D false information, like Tell(D, Box, "apple"), hoping to mislead D. But D saw the banana being placed in the box with their own eyes, so D would likely not believe my lie.
- Any Ask or Tell costs 0.5 points, which would hurt my team.
- Since D directly witnessed the banana being placed in the box, there's no way to confuse D about this. D will answer correctly regardless of what I say.

The best action is to not waste points on a futile attempt to mislead D.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room when C put a banana in the box.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: I put a ball in the bag, B moved the ball from bag to basket, C moved the ball from basket to bag.

So D knows that a banana was put in the box, and D was not present for any changes to the box. The banana is still in the box (nobody moved it).

D will be asked what is in the box. D knows a banana was placed in the box and left before anything else happened. The banana is still in the box since no one moved it.

D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly - "banana" - since D saw C put the banana in the box and nothing happened to the box after that.

Since D is on the opposing team and will likely answer correctly, I want to mislead D. I could Tell D false information about the box to try to confuse them. However, D saw the banana placed in the box with their own eyes, so they might not believe me.

But it's worth considering: D might think something changed after they left. If I tell D something different is in the box, D might doubt their knowledge since things could have changed while they were out. Let me try to mislead D.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room when C put a banana in the box.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: C put an apple in the bag, I moved the apple to the basket, B moved the apple to the bag, C moved the apple to the basket.

D knows the banana was put in the box. After D left, the banana was never moved - it's still in the box. So D knows the box contains a banana, and D would correctly answer "banana."

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider whether I can do anything to prevent this.

I could Tell D incorrect information about the box to try to confuse D. For example, I could tell D the box is empty or contains something else. But this costs 0.5 points, and D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). D saw the banana go into the box with their own eyes, and nothing happened before D left to change that. D would likely ignore my misinformation.

The cost of telling D something is 0.5 points, and it's unlikely to change D's answer since D directly witnessed the banana being placed in the box and has no reason to believe it was moved (D would know if someone entered/left the room, but the banana was never moved anyway).

So the best action is to Pass and not waste points.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts an orange in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the orange from the box to the bag. ... C puts an apple in the box. ... B moves the apple from the box to the basket. ... You move the orange from the bag to the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room when C put an orange in the box.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: I moved the orange from box to bag, C put an apple in the box, B moved the apple from box to basket, I moved the orange from bag to box.

So D last saw an orange go into the box, then left. D doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves.

Current actual state:
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty
- Basket: apple

D will be asked what's in the box. D's best guess based on their knowledge would be "orange" (since that's what was in the box when they left, and they don't know about subsequent moves).

The actual answer is "orange" - so D would likely guess correctly! That would give the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell D false information to mislead them. For example, I could tell D the box contains something else, hoping D believes me and gives a wrong answer. But this costs 0.5 points.

However, I'm on the Blue team (player A), and D is on the Red team. If I tell D false information, D might be suspicious since I'm an opponent. D might reason: "Why would an opponent tell me the truth? They're probably lying." This could backfire - D might disbelieve my lie and still say orange, or D might believe my lie.

Let me think about the strategic calculus:
- If I Pass: D likely says "orange" (correct) → Red gets 1 point. Score: Blue 0, Red 1.
- If I Tell D the box contains something wrong (e.g., "apple"): costs 0.5 points. If D believes me, D says "apple" (wrong), Red gets 0. Score: Blue -0.5, Red 0. If D disbelieves me, D says "orange" (correct). Score: Blue -0.5, Red 1.

D might reason that since I'm an opponent, I'd lie. But D also might think I'm telling the truth to seem trustworthy. It's risky.

Actually, the key insight: D already thinks the box has an orange (which happens to be correct). If I tell D something different, D has to decide who to trust - their own memory or my statement. Since I'm an opponent, D would likely stick with their own knowledge.

So telling D false info would likely cost me 0.5 points without changing D's answer. That's bad.

I should Pass.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would help my team.

**What D knows:**
- D was in the room and put a brick in the bag, then left.
- After D left, I moved the brick from the bag to the box, and B put an apple in the bag. D doesn't know about these changes.
- D thinks the brick is still in the bag.

**What will happen:**
- D will be asked what's in the bag. D thinks it's a brick, so D will likely answer "brick."
- The correct answer is "apple" (since B put an apple in the bag after the brick was moved to the box).
- So D will answer incorrectly, which means the Red team won't score a point. That's good for us.

**Should I take an action?**
- If I Tell D the correct contents, that would help the Red team score, which is bad for us.
- If I Pass, D will likely answer "brick" which is wrong. Red gets 0 points.
- There's no benefit to spending 0.5 points on any action here.

D answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. D puts a brick in the bag.
2. D leaves the room. (D knows: brick is in bag)
3. I move the brick from bag to box. (D doesn't see this)
4. B puts an apple in the bag. (D doesn't see this)
5. B leaves the room. (B knows: brick in box, apple in bag)
6. C moves brick from box to basket. (B and D don't see this)
7. I move brick from basket to box. (B and D don't see this)
8. C moves brick from box to basket. (B and D don't see this)

Current state:
- Bag: apple
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

**D's knowledge:** D last saw the brick placed in the bag, then left. D doesn't know about any changes after leaving. D will likely answer "brick" for the bag.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to D. The correct answer is "apple."

D is on the Red team. If D answers correctly (apple), Red gets 1 point. If D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0.

D will likely say "brick" (what D last knew was in the bag), which would be wrong. That's good for my team.

However, C is on D's team and C knows the current state. C saw everything that happened. But it's MY turn, not C's turn. After my action, C might get a turn to Tell D the correct answer.

If I Pass, C might use their turn to Tell D that the bag contains an apple, costing Red 0.5 points but gaining 1 point (net +0.5 for Red).

If I Tell D wrong information, it costs me 0.5 points but might confuse D. But C could still correct D afterward.

Actually, I need to consider the turn order. It says "It is your turn." I don't know if other players get turns before the answer phase. Let me think about what's optimal.

If I Pass (0 cost), D will likely answer "brick" (wrong) → Red gets 0. Good for Blue.

But if C gets a turn and tells D the truth, D could answer "apple" correctly.

I think Passing is best here - it costs nothing and D is likely to answer wrong based on their knowledge.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the question will be.

D was in the room when they put a brick in the bag. Then D left the room. After D left:
- I moved the brick from the bag to the box
- B put an apple in the bag
- B left the room
- I moved the brick from the box to the basket
- I moved the brick from the basket to the box

D doesn't know about any of these changes. D last saw the brick in the bag, so D will likely answer "brick" for what's in the bag.

The actual contents of the bag: an apple (B put it there, and I never moved it).

So D will likely answer "brick" which is wrong. That's good for my team (Blue) since D is on the Red team.

If I Tell D the truth, that would help the Red team - I don't want that. If I Pass, D will likely answer "brick" which is incorrect, and Red gets no points.

I should Pass to avoid spending points and let D answer incorrectly.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team.

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: apple
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

**What D knows:**
D was in the room when they put the ball in the bag, then D left. After D left:
- C moved the ball from bag to basket (D doesn't know this)
- B moved the ball from basket to bag (D doesn't know this)
- I moved the ball from bag to box (D doesn't know this)
- B put an apple in the bag (D doesn't know this)

So D thinks the ball is still in the bag. D will answer "ball" when asked what's in the bag.

**The correct answer is "apple."**

D is on the Red team. If D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point. That's fine for us. But I should consider whether I want to spend 0.5 points to tell D the wrong thing or the right thing.

If I do nothing (Pass): D will likely answer "ball" (wrong). Red gets 0 points. Blue stays at 0. Score: Blue=0, Red=0.

If I Tell D the truth (Tell(D, bag, apple)): D might answer "apple" (correct). Red gets 1 point. Blue loses 0.5 points. Score: Blue=-0.5, Red=1. This is terrible for us.

If I Tell D a lie (Tell(D, bag, something wrong)): D might get confused but could still answer "ball" or the lie. Either way, spending 0.5 points to potentially mislead D is unnecessary since D is already going to answer wrong.

The best action is to Pass. D will answer "ball" which is wrong, and we don't spend any points.

Pass
D answers: ball
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- D put an orange in the bag, then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the orange from the bag to the box, and put a ball in the bag.
- D doesn't know about C's moves (D was outside the room), so D thinks the orange is still in the bag.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

**What D believes:** D thinks the bag contains the orange (since D left before C made changes).

**The actual answer:** The bag contains a ball.

D is on the Red team. If D answers "orange" (which is what D believes), that's wrong, and Red gets 0 points. That's good for me.

**Should I Tell D the truth?** No! That would help the Red team and cost me 0.5 points.

**Should I Tell D a lie?** D already has the wrong belief. If I tell D something, D might become suspicious or it might accidentally help. There's no benefit.

**Could D be helped by C?** It's not C's turn - it's my turn. After my turn, the answer phase happens. So C doesn't get a chance to tell D.

Wait, let me reconsider the turn structure. The action phase says "the player whose turn it is" - so only I act this turn. Then D answers.

D will likely answer "orange" which is wrong. Red scores 0. This is the best outcome for Blue.

I should Pass to avoid spending any points.

D answers: orange

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be most beneficial for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room initially and put an orange in the bag.
- B left the room (D saw this).
- D then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the orange from bag to box, put a ball in the bag, moved the orange from box to basket, I moved the orange from basket to box, and C moved the orange from box to basket.
- D doesn't know about any of these changes after leaving.

So D thinks the orange is still in the bag. D will likely answer "orange" when asked what's in the bag.

**What's actually in the bag:** A ball (C put it there).

So D will answer incorrectly ("orange"), which means the Red team won't get a point. That's good for us.

Now, should I spend 0.5 points to Tell D the correct answer? No! D is on the Red team. If I tell D the truth, D would answer correctly and Red gets 1 point. That would hurt us.

Should I Tell D wrong information? That could be useful, but D already has wrong information (thinks orange is in the bag). Spending 0.5 points to reinforce wrong information or give different wrong information isn't necessary.

Could I mislead D further? D already thinks the bag has an orange. If I tell D something different, D might get confused and not know what to believe. But D might also become suspicious and reconsider. It's risky and costs 0.5 points.

The best action is to Pass. D already has incorrect information about the bag, and spending points to intervene is unnecessary.

Pass
D answers: orange
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- B put a brick in the box (everyone saw this)
- C left the room
- D left the room
- After both C and D left: B moved the brick from the box to the bag, and put a banana in the box

**What D knows:**
- D saw B put a brick in the box
- D left the room, so D doesn't know about the brick being moved to the bag or the banana being placed in the box
- D would believe the box still contains the brick

**The question is for D: "What is in the box?"**
- The actual contents of the box: banana
- D believes the box contains: brick
- D will likely answer "brick" which is **wrong**

This is good for my team (Blue) since D is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly. I should NOT help D by telling them the truth. I should Pass to avoid spending points and let D answer incorrectly.

Wait - but D getting it wrong means Red gets 0 points. That doesn't directly help Blue score points either. Let me reconsider...

Actually, the goal is to be the first team to 4 points. If D answers wrong, Red gets 0. If I Pass, Blue loses nothing. This is the optimal play - let D answer incorrectly.

Could D ask someone or could someone tell D? It's MY turn right now, not anyone else's. So the only action that happens is mine. I should definitely not help D.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a brick in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the brick from the box to the bag. ... B puts a banana in the box. ... You move the brick from the bag to the basket. ... B moves the brick from the basket to the bag. ... You move the brick from the bag to the basket. ...

I am going to ask D what is in the box.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through the scenario from D's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room. D sees B put a brick in the box.
2. C leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.

After D leaves, D doesn't see any of the subsequent moves. So D believes:
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty
- Basket: empty

But the actual state at the end is:
- Box: banana
- Bag: empty
- Basket: brick

The question is asking D what's in the box. D will likely answer "brick" (based on what D last saw), but the correct answer is "banana."

Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer incorrectly. D's natural belief is that the box contains a brick, which is wrong - the box actually contains a banana. So D answering incorrectly is good for my team.

If I Pass, D will likely say "brick" and get it wrong. Red gets 0 points.

If I Tell D the truth (Tell(D, box, banana)), D might use that information to answer correctly, giving Red 1 point, and it costs my team 0.5 points. That would be terrible.

If I Tell D something false, it costs 0.5 points and D might get confused but D might also just stick with their own knowledge.

The best action is to Pass - D will likely answer "brick" which is wrong, and it costs me nothing.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. B puts brick in box (everyone in room: A, B, C, D)
2. C leaves the room
3. D leaves the room
4. B moves brick from box to bag (only A, B in room)
5. B puts banana in box (only A, B in room)
6. B moves brick from bag to basket (only A, B in room)
7. A moves brick from basket to bag (only A, B in room)

**Current state:**
- Bag: brick
- Box: banana
- Basket: empty

**What D knows:**
D saw the brick placed in the box, then C left, then D left. D doesn't know about any moves after that. So D thinks the brick is still in the box.

**The question:** I will ask D what is in the box.

D will likely answer "brick" based on what they last saw. But the actual contents of the box is "banana." So D would answer incorrectly, which is good for my Blue team (Red doesn't get a point).

Now, should I Tell D the correct answer or not? If D answers wrong, Red gets 0 points. If I tell D the correct answer, it costs me 0.5 points and Red gets 1 point, netting Red +1 and Blue -0.5. That's bad for me.

Should I try to mislead D? I could Tell D something wrong, but D already has a wrong answer (brick), so spending 0.5 points to mislead them further is wasteful.

The best action is to Pass. D will likely answer "brick" (wrong), Red gets 0 points, and Blue loses nothing.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the bag. ... C leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the apple from the bag to the basket. ... You move the apple from the basket to the bag. ... B moves the apple from the bag to the box. ... B puts a banana in the bag. ...

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player saw:

**What D saw (was in the room until they left):**
- B puts an apple in the bag
- C leaves the room
- D leaves the room (after C)

**After D left, D doesn't know about:**
- B moving the apple from bag to basket
- Me moving the apple from basket to bag
- B moving the apple from bag to box
- B putting a banana in the bag

**So D believes:** The apple is still in the bag (that's the last thing D saw before leaving).

**Actual state of the bag:** banana is in the bag.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

D will likely answer "apple" based on what they last saw. The correct answer is "banana." So D will get it wrong, meaning Red won't score a point. That's good for us.

Now, should I take an action? 

- If I **Tell D** the correct contents (banana), it would cost us 0.5 points but help Red score 1 point. That's bad for us (-0.5 for us, +1 for Red). Definitely not.
- If I **Tell D** incorrect contents, it costs us 0.5 points. D already believes "apple" (wrong), so telling them something else wrong doesn't help. It just costs us 0.5.
- If I **Ask** anyone anything, it costs 0.5 points and doesn't help since I already know everything in the room.

The best action is to **Pass**. D will likely answer "apple" (wrong), Red gets 0 points, and we lose nothing.

Pass
D answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what the optimal action is.

**What I know:**
- B put a brick in the basket, then B left.
- After B left, D moved the brick from the basket to the bag.
- Then C put a ball in the basket.
- Then I left the room.

So at the time I left:
- Bag: brick
- Basket: ball
- Box: empty

**What D knows:**
D was in the room the entire time and saw everything. D knows:
- Bag: brick
- Basket: ball
- Box: empty

**The question:** I will be asked to D what is in the basket.

D knows the basket contains a ball. But D is on the Red team, so D will likely answer incorrectly to avoid giving the Blue team a point... wait, no. The question is asked to D, and if D answers correctly, the **Red team** gets 1 point.

So D will want to answer correctly. D knows the ball is in the basket. D will answer "ball" and Red gets 1 point.

Since the question is being asked to D (a Red team player), and D knows the correct answer (ball), there's nothing I can do to prevent Red from scoring. D has full knowledge of the room since D never left.

However, I could try to use a Tell action to mislead D. If I tell D something false about the basket, D might get confused... but D was in the room the whole time and saw everything. D knows what's in the basket. D would have no reason to believe my false information over their own direct observation.

Any Tell action to D would cost us 0.5 points and D would just ignore it since D has perfect knowledge. An Ask action would also cost 0.5 points with no benefit.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether D knows the answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. B puts a brick in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the brick from the basket to the bag.
4. C puts a ball in the basket.
5. I move the brick from the bag to the box.
6. C moves the brick from the box to the bag.
7. D moves the brick from the bag to the box.
8. I leave the room.

After all these events (before I left), the state is:
- **Basket**: ball (C put it there in step 4, and nobody moved it out)
- **Box**: brick (D moved it there in step 7)
- **Bag**: empty

D was in the room for all of these events, so D knows exactly what's in the basket. D knows the basket contains a ball.

Now, D is on the Red team. The question is being asked to D, and D will answer correctly (getting 1 point for Red) since D was present for everything.

I can't prevent D from answering correctly. The question is whether I should spend 0.5 points to tell or ask someone something, or just Pass.

There's nothing I can do to change D's answer - D knows the basket has a ball. Spending points would only hurt my team.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether D knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. B puts a brick in the basket. (All four players see this)
2. B leaves the room. (A, C, D remain)
3. D moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (A, C, D see this)
4. C puts a ball in the basket. (A, C, D see this)
5. D moves the brick from the bag to the box. (A, C, D see this)
6. D moves the brick from the box to the bag. (A, C, D see this)
7. C moves the brick from the bag to the box. (A, C, D see this)
8. D moves the brick from the box to the bag. (A, C, D see this)
9. I (A) move the brick from the bag to the box. (A, C, D see this)
10. C moves the brick from the box to the bag. (A, C, D see this)
11. I (A) leave the room. (C, D remain)

At the point I leave the room:
- Bag: brick
- Basket: ball
- Box: empty

After I leave, I don't know what happens. But the question asks D what's in the basket.

D is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the basket. D knows the current state of the room (since D is still in the room). At the time I left, the basket contained the ball. D would know if anything changed after I left.

Since D is on the Red team, D will answer correctly (it benefits the Red team). The question is whether I should take any action to help my team.

The question is directed at D (Red team), so D answering correctly gives Red 1 point. There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D is in the room and knows the current contents.

I should Pass to avoid spending points unnecessarily. Any Tell or Ask action would cost 0.5 points and wouldn't help since D will answer correctly regardless (D is in the room and knows the contents).

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether D knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room. B puts a banana in the basket.
2. D leaves the room.
3. C moves the banana from the basket to the bag. (D doesn't see this)
4. D enters the room.
5. C moves the banana from the bag to the basket. (D sees this)
6. B leaves the room.
7. D moves the banana from the basket to the box. (D knows this - D did it!)
8. C puts a ball in the basket. (D sees this)
9. I (A) leave the room.
10. B enters the room.
11. B leaves the room.

So the current state of the basket is: **ball** (placed by C in step 8).

Now, what does D know? D was present for steps 7 and 8. D moved the banana to the box, and then C put a ball in the basket. D saw all of this. So D knows the basket contains a **ball**.

After I left (step 9), B entered and then left. I don't know if anything happened while B was in the room, but the scenario doesn't mention any moves during that time, so the basket still has the ball.

D is on the Red team, so D will answer correctly (ball) and score a point for Red. 

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell D false information, but D was in the room and saw C put the ball in the basket, so D would likely trust their own memory over my claim.

There's nothing I can do to help my team here - D knows the answer. Any Tell action would cost 0.5 points and D would likely ignore it since D has direct knowledge. An Ask would also cost 0.5 points with no benefit.

- I was in the room when B put a brick in the box.

Wait - actually, C will be asked by the game master, and a correct answer gives Red 1 point. C knows the contents because C was present the entire time. C will almost certainly answer correctly.

If I use Tell to give C false information, C has no reason to believe me over their own observations. C was in the room the whole time and saw everything directly. My telling C something false won't confuse C because C has perfect information.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a brick in the bag. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... D moves the brick from the box to the bag. ... D leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask you what is in the bag.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. The bag, box, and basket are all empty.
2. C puts a brick in the bag. → Bag has brick.
3. "..." - time passes. I'm in the room, so I'd see anything that happens.
4. I leave the room. → I can no longer see what happens inside.
5. "..." - time passes. Things could have happened that I didn't see.
6. I enter the room. → I can see what happens from now on.
7. D moves the brick from the **box** to the **bag**. → This tells me that while I was outside, someone moved the brick from the bag to the box. Now D moves it back: brick is in the bag.
8. D leaves the room.

So at the end of the scenario, the brick is in the bag.

Wait - but I need to consider: D moved the brick from the box to the bag. That means when I re-entered, the brick was in the box (moved there while I was away). After D's action, the brick is now in the bag.

After D leaves, there's "..." which means more time could pass. B and C are still in the room (B never left, C never left as far as I know). Could something else have happened after D left? The scenario ends with "..." after D leaves, but I'm in the room, so I would see anything that happens. Since nothing else is described, nothing else happened.

So the bag contains the brick.

Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

1. **Everyone (A, B, C, D) in room.** D puts an orange in the bag. → Bag: orange
2. **I (A) leave the room.** I don't see what happens while I'm out.
3. **I enter the room.** I can now see what happens again.
4. **C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.** Wait - this says C moves the orange from the *basket* to the *bag*. This means while I was outside, someone must have moved the orange from the bag to the basket. Now C moves it back to the bag. → Bag: orange
5. **C leaves the room.**
6. **I move the orange from the bag to the box.** → Bag: empty, Box: orange
7. **D puts a banana in the bag.** → Bag: banana

So the bag currently contains a **banana**.

I know this directly since I was present for the last actions. I don't need to ask anyone.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the scenario carefully:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. There's an empty bag, empty box, and empty basket.
2. C puts an apple in the bag. → Bag has apple.
3. "..." - time passes. I'm still in the room during this time.
4. I leave the room. → I can no longer see what happens inside.
5. "..." - time passes while I'm outside. Things could have happened that I don't know about.
6. I enter the room. → I can now see what happens again.
7. D moves the apple from the **box** to the **bag**. → This tells me that at the time I re-entered, the apple was in the box (it must have been moved there while I was outside). D then moves it from the box to the bag.

So after step 7, the bag contains the apple.

But wait - I need to consider what else might have happened while I was outside the room. The scenario only describes what I can observe. While I was outside, someone moved the apple from the bag to the box (since D later moves it from the box). But other things could have happened too - other objects could have been placed in containers.

However, the key question is: what is in the bag now? After D moves the apple from the box to the bag, the bag contains the apple. But could something else have been placed in the bag while I was outside, and then moved before I returned? The scenario describes everything I see after I return, and D moves the apple into the bag. Since each container holds at most one object, and D successfully puts the apple in the bag, the bag must have been empty when D did this (or D's action replaced whatever was there - but the rules say containers hold at most one object, so the bag must have been empty for D to put the apple there).

After D's action, the bag contains the apple. Nothing else happens after that.

I'm confident the answer is the apple. No need to spend points asking anyone.

Pass
A answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through the scenario from my perspective:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room. Bag, box, and basket are all empty.
2. D leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. C puts a banana in the box. (I see this because I'm still in the room!)
5. B enters the room.
6. D enters the room.
7. I leave the room.

After I leave the room, I don't know if anything else happened. But based on what I last saw, the box contains a banana.

However, since I left the room, something could have changed after I left. B, C, and D were all in the room when I left, so any of them could have moved things around.

But the scenario description ends with "You leave the room. ..." and then the scenario ends. The ellipsis suggests time passed, but nothing else is described to me (which is consistent - I'm outside the room and wouldn't see changes inside).

Since I'm being asked the question and I need to answer correctly, I should consider whether to spend 0.5 points to Ask someone who is currently in the room what's in the box (in case something changed after I left), or just answer based on my last knowledge.

The risk: if something changed after I left, I'd get it wrong (0 points). If I ask someone, I spend 0.5 points but could get the correct answer (net 0.5 points). If nothing changed and I just answer, I get 1 point for free.

B is my teammate and would be truthful. B is in the room and would know the current state. Let me ask B to be safe, since the ellipsis after I leave suggests something might have happened.

Actually, wait - the cost is 0.5 points and the gain is 1 point if correct. If I'm fairly confident the banana is still in the box, I should just Pass and answer "banana." The ellipsis might just indicate time passing with nothing happening.

I'll go with my knowledge and save the 0.5 points.

Pass
A answers: banana
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

3. C puts a banana in the box. (I saw this happen - I was still in the room)
4. B enters the room.
5. D enters the room.
6. D puts a ball in the basket. (I saw this too)
7. D leaves, then enters again.
8. B leaves, then enters again.
9. I leave the room.

After I left the room, something could have happened that I'm unaware of. But the question is asking ME what's in the box, and I need to consider whether anything changed after I left.

Since the scenario ends with "You leave the room. ..." and the ellipsis suggests time passed, something might have happened after I left. However, I was present when C put the banana in the box, and I have no information suggesting it was moved after I left.

The players still in the room after I left are B, C, and D (B re-entered before I left, and C never left, and D re-entered). Any of them could have changed things after I left.

But since I'm the one being asked, and I directly witnessed the banana being placed in the box, and I have no evidence it was changed, I should answer based on my knowledge. Let me consider whether asking someone would help.

B was in the room after I left and could tell me if anything changed. That would cost 0.5 points but could confirm the answer (worth 1 point).

The risk is: if something changed after I left, I'd lose 1 point by answering wrong. If nothing changed, asking costs 0.5 unnecessarily.

Let me ask B to be safe.

Ask(B, box)
A answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D leaves the room. ... B leaves the room. ... C puts an apple in the box. ... B enters the room. ... D enters the room. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... D moves the apple from the box to the basket. ... C moves the apple from the basket to the box. ... D leaves the room. ... D enters the room. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box based on what I observed.

Let me trace through the events I witnessed:

1. I, B, C, and D are in the room (bag, box, basket all empty).
2. D leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. C puts an apple in the box. (I saw this)
5. B enters the room.
6. D enters the room.
7. I leave the room. (From this point, I can't see what happens inside)
8. I enter the room. (I can see again)
9. D moves the apple from the box to the basket. (I saw this)
10. C moves the apple from the basket to the box. (I saw this)
11. D leaves the room.
12. D enters the room.
13. I leave the room. (I can't see what happens after this)

So the last thing I saw was C moving the apple from the basket to the box (step 10). After that, D left and re-entered (steps 11-12), and then I left (step 13). 

The question is: did anything happen between D entering (step 12) and me leaving (step 13), or after I left? Since the scenario shows "D enters the room. ... You leave the room. ..." - the ellipsis with "..." suggests passage of time, meaning something *could* have happened while I was still in the room or after I left.

But wait - the scenario only describes what I see. If something happened while I was in the room, it would have been described to me. So between D entering and me leaving, nothing happened (or I would have seen it). After I left, I don't know what happened.

So as far as I know, the apple is in the box. But something could have changed after I left. B, C, and D are all in the room after I leave.

Since I'm being asked the question and I need to answer, I should consider whether I need to ask someone. B is my teammate and was in the room when I left - B could tell me if anything changed. But it costs 0.5 points.

The risk is: if something changed after I left, I'd get 0 points. If nothing changed, I get 1 point. Asking costs 0.5, so if I ask and answer correctly, I net 0.5 points.

Given that the scenario explicitly shows "..." after I leave (suggesting possible events), it's safer to ask B.

Ask(B, box)
A answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

The answer is straightforward. I was in the room when C put a banana in the box, and nothing else happened to the box before I left. So I know the box contains a banana.

However, I should note that after I left the room, B was still in the room (along with D), so something could have changed. Let me reconsider.

After I left, B and D were still in the room. They could have moved the banana out of the box. I wouldn't know about that since I was outside the room.

But wait - the scenario only describes what I can observe. Since I left the room, I wouldn't be told about any changes. However, the question asks me what's in the box, and I need to consider whether something might have changed.

Let me reconsider whether I should ask B what's in the box, since B stayed in the room and would know the current state.

Actually, let me re-read: "C leaves the room" happens after I leave. I know C leaves because I'm told when players enter/leave. But I don't know what B and D might have done while I was outside.

Let me change my action:

Ask(B, box)

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events I witnessed:

1. Everyone starts in the room. Empty bag, box, basket.
2. D leaves the room.
3. C puts an orange in the bag. (I see this)
4. D enters the room.
5. I leave the room. (From here, I can't see what happens inside)
6. I enter the room. (I can see again)
7. D moves the orange from the bag to the basket. (I see this)
8. C moves the orange from the basket to the bag. (I see this)
9. D leaves the room.
10. D enters the room.
11. I leave the room. (I can't see what happens inside anymore)
12. C leaves the room.

So after step 8, the orange is in the bag. Then at step 9, D leaves. At step 10, D enters. At step 11, I leave. At step 12, C leaves.

The question is: did anything happen between steps 8 and 11 that I didn't see? Between steps 8-10, I was in the room, so I would have seen everything. Nothing is described as happening during that time, so the orange stayed in the bag.

Between step 11 (I leave) and step 12 (C leaves), I'm outside the room. D is inside the room (D entered at step 10). C is also inside the room (C hasn't left yet). So both C and D are in the room after I leave. Something could have happened that I didn't see.

But the scenario says "You leave the room. ... C leaves the room." - the ellipsis indicates passage of time, and something could have happened. However, the scenario only describes what I can observe. Since I'm outside, I wouldn't know if D or C moved the orange.

So I'm uncertain about what's in the bag now. D is still in the room and would know. C was in the room until leaving. B was... let me check - B's movements aren't mentioned after the start, so B has been in the room the entire time! B would know everything that happened.

Let me ask B what's in the bag.

At the point I left the room the second time, the stapler was in the basket. Things could have changed after I left, but I have no information suggesting they did.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what B needs to know.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room when D put a brick in the bag. ✓ B knows the bag has a brick.
2. B left the room. After that, B doesn't know what happened inside.

The bag still has a brick (nothing happened to it after D put it there). So B knows the correct answer: the bag contains a brick.

Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me analyze the situation:

1. **What's in the bag**: D put a brick in the bag. Nothing else happened to the bag after that. So the bag contains a brick.

2. **What B knows about the bag**: B was in the room when D put the brick in the bag. Then B left the room. Nothing happened to the bag after B left. So B should know the bag contains a brick.

3. **The question**: I will be asked what B says is in the bag. Since B was present when the brick was placed in the bag and left before anything else happened to it, B knows the bag contains a brick.

Since B already knows the correct answer (a brick is in the bag), there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B. B should answer correctly on their own.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether B knows this.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. All containers are empty.
2. D puts an orange in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens.)
4. D moves the orange from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this.)
5. C puts a brick in the bag. (B doesn't see this.)
6. D moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this.)
7. C moves the orange from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this.)
8. D leaves the room. (B knows D left, but not what happened.)

Final state:
- Bag: orange
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

B's knowledge: B last saw the orange put in the bag (step 2), then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B would think the bag still contains the orange.

The question is asking B what's in the bag. The correct answer is **orange**. B would naturally guess orange based on what B saw before leaving.

So B's belief (orange in the bag) happens to be correct! B should answer "orange" and will get it right without any help from me.

I should Pass to save the 0.5 points since B already has the correct information.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

1. B was in the room when I put a ball in the bag.
2. D left the room.
3. B was in the room when B moved the ball from the bag to the box.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) in room. I put a ball in the bag.
2. D leaves the room.
3. B moves the ball from the bag to the box.
4. I put a banana in the bag.
5. B leaves the room.
6. I move the ball from the box to the basket.
7. C moves the ball from the basket to the box.
8. I move the ball from the box to the basket.

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: ball

**What B knows:**
B was present for steps 1-4, then left at step 5. At the time B left:
- Bag: banana (I put it there in step 4)
- Box: ball (B moved it there in step 3)
- Basket: empty

B has been outside the room since step 5, so B doesn't know about any changes after that. B would believe the bag still contains a banana.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" The correct answer is **banana**.

B should know this! B saw me put the banana in the bag (step 4), and nothing happened to the bag after that from B's perspective (B left right after). So B should correctly answer "banana."

Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B. I'll pass.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario from B's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room. A puts a ball in the bag. (B sees this)
2. D leaves the room. (B sees this)
3. B moves the ball from the bag to the box. (B does this)
4. A puts a banana in the bag. (B sees this)
5. B leaves the room. (B does this)
6. After B leaves: C moves ball from box to basket, A moves ball from basket to box, C moves ball from box to basket.

So from B's perspective, when B left the room:
- Bag: banana
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

B doesn't know about anything that happened after leaving. So B would think the bag contains a **banana**.

The actual state of the bag is: **banana** (the banana was put in the bag and was never moved out).

So B actually knows the correct answer! The bag contains a banana, and B saw the banana being put in the bag and never saw it removed (it wasn't removed). B should answer "banana" which is correct.

Since B already knows the correct answer (banana is in the bag, and B saw it placed there and never saw it removed), I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. I put an orange in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. B moves the orange from the bag to the box. (A, B, C see this)

6. B leaves the room.
7. C moves the orange from the box to the basket. (Only A and C see this)
8. C moves the banana from the bag to the box. (Only A and C see this)
9. C moves the banana from the box to the bag. (Only A and C see this)

Current actual state:
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: orange

What B knows (B left after step 5):
- B saw the orange moved to the box (step 4)
- B saw the banana put in the bag (step 5)
- B doesn't know about any of C's moves (steps 7-9)

So B would think:
- Bag: banana
- Box: orange
- Basket: empty

The question is: What is in the bag?

The actual answer is **banana**, and B would also think the bag contains **banana** (since C moved the banana out and back in, but B doesn't know about those intermediate moves).

So B's belief about the bag happens to be correct! B should answer "banana" and would naturally do so based on their knowledge. I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

B answers: banana

B's knowledge: B saw D put an orange in the box, then B left. B doesn't know about anything after that. So B should know the box contains an orange.

The question is: "What is in the box?" directed at B.

B saw the orange being placed in the box and left before anything else happened to the box. The orange is still in the box. So B should correctly answer "orange" and our team gets 1 point.

6. D moves the banana from the box to the bag. (Only A and D see this)

So the current state is:

B left after step 1, so B last saw the banana in the bag. B would think the bag still contains the banana.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B.

B's belief is that the bag contains a banana, which happens to be correct! The banana is indeed in the bag right now.

So B would answer "banana" which is correct. My team gets 1 point for free.

If I Tell B anything, it costs 0.5 points and B might already answer correctly. Since B's natural answer (banana) is correct, I should just Pass and save the 0.5 points.

Let me trace through what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. I put a stapler in the box.
2. B leaves the room. (B knows the box has a stapler at this point)
3. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. C puts a ball in the box. (B doesn't see this)
5. D leaves the room.

So the current state is:
- Box: ball
- Bag: stapler
- Basket: empty

B's knowledge: B last saw me put a stapler in the box, then left. B doesn't know about any changes after that. So B thinks the box still has a stapler.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the box?" The correct answer is "ball."

B doesn't know this - B would likely answer "stapler" which is wrong. I need to tell B what's actually in the box so our team gets the point.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a stapler in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... C puts a ball in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the basket. ... C moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the basket. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the box.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and whether B knows it.

Let me trace through the events:
1. I put a stapler in the box. (Everyone sees this: A, B, C, D)
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. C puts a ball in the box. (B doesn't see this)
5. D leaves the room.
6. I move the stapler from the bag to the basket.
7. C moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.
8. I move the stapler from the bag to the basket.

Current state:
- Box: ball
- Basket: stapler
- Bag: empty

B left after step 1 and hasn't returned. B last saw the stapler being put in the box, so B thinks the box contains the stapler. But the box actually contains a ball.

I need to tell B what's in the box so B can answer correctly. The cost is 0.5 points, but getting the answer right gives 1 point, so it's a net gain of 0.5.

Tell(B, box, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. I put a stapler in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens.)
4. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this.)
5. C puts a ball in the box. (B doesn't see this.)
6. D leaves the room.
7. I move the stapler from the bag to the basket. (Only I and C see this.)
8. I move the stapler from the basket to the bag. (Only I and C see this.)

Current state:
- Bag: stapler
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

B's knowledge: B saw me put a stapler in the box, then left. B doesn't know about any changes after that. So B would think the box still contains the stapler.

The question is asking B what is in the box. The correct answer is **ball**.

B doesn't know this - B thinks it's the stapler. I need to tell B the correct answer to help our team score.

Tell(B, box, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether B knows this.

Let me trace through the events:
1. I put an apple in the bag. (Everyone in room: A, B, C, D)
2. B leaves the room.
3. C moves the apple from the bag to the basket. (B is outside, doesn't see this)
4. D moves the apple from the basket to the bag. (B is outside)
5. D moves the apple from the bag to the box. (B is outside)
6. C puts a ball in the bag. (B is outside)
7. D leaves the room.

So the current state is:
- Bag: ball
- Box: apple
- Basket: empty

B left after step 1 and never came back. B saw me put the apple in the bag, and then left. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. So B thinks the bag still contains the apple.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the bag?" The correct answer is "ball."

B doesn't know this - B thinks it's the apple. I need to tell B the correct contents of the bag so our team gets the point.

Tell(B, bag, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me analyze what each player knows:

**Me (A):** I saw everything. The box currently contains an orange. The bag contains the ball.

**B:** B saw D put a ball in the box, then B left the room. B doesn't know about C moving the ball to the bag or C putting an orange in the box. So B thinks the box still contains the ball.

**C:** C knows everything (was in the room the whole time). C knows the box has an orange.

**D:** D saw the ball put in the box, then left. D doesn't know about C's actions. D thinks the box has the ball.

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the box. B thinks it's the ball, but it's actually the orange.

I need to tell B the correct answer so our team gets the point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer gives us 1 point, so net gain is 0.5 points.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Everyone starts in the room.
2. D puts a ball in the box.
3. B leaves the room.
4. D leaves the room.
5. C moves the ball from the box to the bag.
6. C puts an orange in the box.
7. I move the ball from the bag to the basket.
8. C moves the ball from the basket to the bag.
9. I move the ball from the bag to the basket.

Current state:
- Box: orange
- Basket: ball
- Bag: empty

B's knowledge: B saw D put a ball in the box, then B left. B doesn't know what happened after that. So B would think the box still contains the ball.

The question is: What is in the box? Asked to B.

B will likely answer "ball" (which is wrong - the box contains an orange).

Since B is my teammate, I should tell B what's actually in the box so B can answer correctly and we get 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer gives us 1 point, so net gain is 0.5 points.

If I don't tell B, B will likely say "ball" and get 0 points. So telling is better (net +0.5 vs 0).

Tell(B, box, orange)
B answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: ball
- Box: orange
- Basket: empty

**What B knows:**
B was in the room when D put the ball in the box. Then B left the room. After that, B is unaware of any container changes. B knows D left after them, and C stayed in the room. B doesn't know about any moves C or I made after B left.

So B thinks: box = ball (last thing B saw before leaving).

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the box — no, actually, B will be asked what is in the box. B needs to answer correctly (orange) for Blue to get a point.

B currently believes the box contains a ball. The correct answer is orange. If I don't tell B, B will likely answer "ball" and we get 0 points.

I should tell B what's actually in the box so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Tell(B, box, orange)
B answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything:
- D put stapler in bag
- B left the room
- D moved stapler from bag to basket
- C moved stapler from basket to bag
- D left the room
- C moved stapler from bag to box
- C put orange in bag

So the current state is: **bag = orange**, **box = stapler**, **basket = empty**.

**What B knows:** B was in the room initially and saw D put the stapler in the bag. Then B left. B doesn't know about any moves after that. So B thinks the bag still contains the stapler.

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the bag. Wait, no - "I am going to ask B what is in the bag." So B will be asked what's in the bag.

B thinks the bag has the **stapler** (since B left before any moves happened). But the bag actually has an **orange**.

B will answer "stapler" which is **wrong**. So Blue team gets 0 points if I don't help.

I should Tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and we get 1 point. The cost is 0.5 points, but the gain is 1 point, for a net of +0.5 points.

Action: I need to figure out the best action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I saw everything. The basket currently contains an apple. The bag contains the orange. The box is empty.

**What B knows:** B was present when I put the orange in the basket. Then B left the room. B doesn't know about C moving the orange to the bag or D putting an apple in the basket. So B thinks the basket still contains the orange.

**What C and D know:** They saw everything (they were in the room the whole time). They know the basket contains an apple.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the basket?" The correct answer is **apple**. B currently thinks it's the orange, so B will answer incorrectly unless I tell B the truth.

If I Tell B the correct contents, it costs 0.5 points but B can answer correctly for +1 point, netting +0.5 for our team.

If I Pass, B will likely answer "orange" (which is wrong), and we get 0 points.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... You put a ball in the bag. ... B moves the ball from the bag to the box. ... You move the ball from the box to the bag. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

Action: The question will be asked to B about the basket. Let me think about what B knows.

B was in the room the entire time and witnessed everything:
1. D put a stapler in the basket
2. D left the room
3. I put a ball in the bag
4. B moved the ball from the bag to the box
5. I moved the ball from the box to the bag

So B knows the basket contains a stapler. B saw D put the stapler in the basket, and nothing was ever moved out of the basket.

Since B already knows the correct answer (stapler), there's no need to spend points telling or asking.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me analyze the situation:

1. **What's in the basket?** D put a stapler in the basket. Nothing else happened to the basket after that. So the basket contains a stapler.

2. **What does B know?** B was in the room the entire time, so B saw everything:
   - D put a stapler in the basket
   - All the orange movements between bag and box
   
   So B knows the basket contains a stapler.

3. **What does D know?** D put the stapler in the basket, then left. D doesn't know about anything that happened after leaving, but nothing happened to the basket after D left anyway.

Since B was in the room the whole time and saw D put the stapler in the basket, B already knows the answer. B will correctly answer "stapler" for the basket.

I should Pass to save the 0.5 points since B already has the correct information.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the basket.

Let me trace through B's perspective:
1. B is in the room: D puts an orange in the basket. **B sees this.**
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the orange from the basket to the bag. **B doesn't see this.**
4. B enters the room.
5. D moves the orange from the bag to the basket. **B sees this.**
6. D leaves the room.

So B saw the orange placed in the basket initially, then left. When B returned, B saw D move the orange from the bag to the basket. So B knows the orange is currently in the basket.

The basket currently contains the orange, and B knows this. B should answer correctly without any help from me.

B answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a stapler in the bag. (Everyone sees this - A, B, C, D all in room)
2. D leaves the room.
3. C leaves the room.
4. B moves the stapler from the bag to the box. (A and B see this)

6. I move the stapler from the box to the basket. (A and B see this)
7. B moves the stapler from the basket to the box. (A and B see this)
8. I move the stapler from the box to the basket. (A and B see this)

Final state:
- Bag: orange
- Box: empty
- Basket: stapler

B was present for all events after C and D left, so B knows:
- Bag: orange

Action: Let me trace through what B knows:

1. B starts in the room, sees me put a ball in the box.
2. B leaves the room.
3. While B is out: D moves the ball from box to basket. B doesn't see this.
4. B enters the room.
5. B sees C put a stapler in the box.
6. D leaves, C leaves.
7. B moves the ball from the box to the bag. Wait - B tries to move "the ball" from the box to the bag. But the box actually contains the stapler (C put it there), not the ball. 

Let me re-read: "B moves the ball from the box to the bag." This is what actually happens in the scenario. But the box contained the stapler, not the ball. Hmm, the scenario describes what actually happens, so B must have moved something from the box to the bag. But the scenario says B moved "the ball" - perhaps B thought it was the ball but it was actually the stapler? 

Actually, the scenario describes objective reality. If it says "B moves the ball from the box to the bag," then the ball was in the box. But wait - D moved the ball to the basket, then C put a stapler in the box. So the box had the stapler. This is contradictory unless the scenario is describing what B *believes* they're doing... 

No, the scenario describes what actually happens. Let me re-read: After C puts a stapler in the box, B moves "the ball from the box to the bag." Since B wasn't present when D moved the ball, B might think the box has the ball. But C put the stapler in the box (B saw this). So B saw C put a stapler in the box, then B moves... 

Actually, B would know the box has a stapler since B watched C put it there. The scenario says B moves the ball - perhaps B moved the stapler thinking it was something else? Regardless, what B moved from the box to the bag was the stapler (since that's what was in the box).

After that, I put an orange in the box. B was present for this.

So B should know the box contains an orange. B was present when I put the orange in the box.

B should answer correctly. I'll save the 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B needs help.

Let me trace through what B saw:

1. B is in the room initially. D puts a stapler in the bag. **B sees this.**
2. B leaves the room. While B is outside, D moves the stapler from the bag to the box. **B does NOT see this.**
3. B enters the room. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. **B sees this.**

So B saw:
- Stapler put in bag (step 1)
- Stapler moved from box to bag (step 3)

From step 3, B sees D move the stapler from the box to the bag. This tells B the stapler is now in the bag.

So B knows the stapler is in the bag, which is the correct answer.

Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... You put an orange in the bag. ... You leave the room. ... D leaves the room. ... D enters the room. ... B enters the room. ... B leaves the room. ...

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can answer correctly.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room initially.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C leaves the room.
4. I put an orange in the bag (only I and D are in the room, so only D sees this).
5. I leave the room.
6. D leaves the room.
7. D enters the room (D is alone, could do something).
8. B enters the room (B and D are in the room, could see/do things).
9. B leaves the room.

Key analysis:
- B was NOT in the room when I put the orange in the bag. So B doesn't know directly.
- When B entered the room (step 8), D was already there. But players can't see inside containers, so B entering the room doesn't tell B what's in the bag.
- Between steps 7-8, D was alone in the room and could have moved things. Between steps 8-9, both B and D were in the room.
- B doesn't know what's in the bag unless someone tells B or B saw something happen.

Since B will be asked what's in the bag, and B doesn't know the answer, I should tell B.

The orange is in the bag (I put it there). However, D re-entered the room (step 7) and could have moved the orange. But the scenario only describes what I see - since I was outside the room during steps 7-9, I wouldn't see if D moved anything. 

But the scenario describes what I see, and it doesn't mention D doing anything to the containers. However, since I was outside the room, I *wouldn't* be told about container manipulations. So D *could* have moved the orange.

Still, the most likely scenario (and the best strategic play) is to tell B what I know - that I put an orange in the bag. If D moved it, there's nothing I can do about that. But telling B gives B the best chance of answering correctly.

Tell(B, bag, orange)
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the box and whether I need to help.

Let me trace through what happened:
- We all started in the room (A, B, C, D)
- D puts an apple in the box (everyone sees this)
- B puts a stapler in the basket (everyone sees this)
- I leave the room
- B leaves the room

After I left, B was still in the room for some time before leaving. So B saw everything that happened until B left. But the key question is: did anything happen to the box after B left?

From my perspective: I left first, then B left. I don't know what happened after I left (before or after B left). However, I do know that B left the room at some point after me.

B knows:
- D put an apple in the box (B was present)
- B would know about anything that happened between when I left and when B left
- B would NOT know about anything that happened after B left

From B's perspective, the last thing B knew about the box was the apple (unless something changed while B was still in the room after I left, which B would know about but I wouldn't).

The scenario as described to me doesn't mention anything happening after I left (since I can't see it), except that B leaves. So I don't have information about whether C or D changed the box contents after I left but before B left, or after B left.

B was in the room after I left, so B has at least as much information as I do about the box. B saw the apple go in, and B would have seen any changes before B left.

Since B has direct knowledge of the box up until B left the room, and I only have knowledge up until I left (which was earlier), B actually knows more than I do. Telling B what I know (apple in the box) would be redundant since B was there when that happened and stayed longer.

The risk is something changed after B left, but I wouldn't know about that either, so I can't help.

I should Pass to save points, since B already knows at least as much as I do about the box.

B answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box so I can help B answer correctly.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room.
2. D puts an apple in the box.
3. I (A) put a ball in the basket.
4. I leave the room.
5. B leaves the room.

Between steps 3 and 4 (when I was still in the room), and between steps 4 and 5 (when I was outside but B was still inside), things could have happened. But the scenario only describes what I can see/know. The "..." between events could mean something happened that I wasn't aware of.

Wait - let me re-read. After I put a ball in the basket, there's "..." then I leave the room. During that "...", I'm still in the room, so I would have seen anything that happened. Nothing is described, so nothing happened during that time.

Then after I leave the room, there's "..." then B leaves. During that time, I'm outside the room, so I wouldn't know what happened inside. B was still inside though, so B would know if C or D moved anything.

So from my perspective, the box contains the apple (as D put it there, and nothing changed while I was in the room). But after I left, C and/or D could have changed things before B left.

B was in the room the entire time until B left, so B knows the current state of the box. I should trust B's knowledge over mine for what happened after I left.

However, the question is being asked to B. B was present for everything until B left. After B left, C and D were still in the room and could have changed things. But the scenario ends with "..." after B leaves - and since both A and B are outside, we wouldn't know about any changes.

Actually, looking at the scenario again - it ends after "B leaves the room. ..." - so there could have been changes after B left that neither of us knows about.

But from B's perspective, B saw D put the apple in the box, and B would have seen if anything changed before B left. B likely knows what was in the box when B left.

The safest action is to tell B what I know - the apple was in the box - in case B somehow missed or forgot. But B was there the whole time I was, plus longer. B should know at least as much as I do about the box.

I'll tell B what I know to be safe:

Tell(B, box, apple)
B answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a banana in the bag. ... You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... D enters the room. ... B enters the room. ... B leaves the room. ...

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the bag and whether I need to help.

Let me trace through the events:

1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. D puts a banana in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
3. I (A) leave the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. D leaves the room.
6. D enters the room.
7. B enters the room.
8. B leaves the room.

Now, what could have happened? After I left the room, B and C and D were still inside. Things could have happened that I didn't see. Then B left, leaving C and D. Then D left, leaving C alone. C could have moved things around while alone. Then D entered (C and D in room), and things could have happened. Then B entered (B, C, D in room), and B would see anything that happens. Then B left.

The key question: does B know what's in the bag?

When B entered the room (step 7), B, C, and D were in the room. B would observe anything that happens while B is in the room. But B wouldn't know what happened while B was outside (between steps 4-7). During that time, C was alone (after D left), and C could have moved the banana out of the bag or swapped things. Then D entered and things could have changed again.

When B re-entered, B wouldn't automatically see the contents of containers - players can't see inside containers. B would only know the current contents if B observed the changes being made.

So B last saw the banana placed in the bag (step 2). Between B leaving and re-entering, C (and later D) could have moved things. B wouldn't know if anything changed while B was out. When B re-entered, unless someone moved things in front of B, B would be uncertain.

However, B might reasonably guess the banana is still in the bag based on what B last saw. But B can't be sure.

I also don't know what happened after I left - things could have changed between my departure and B's departure, and I wouldn't know either.

But wait - between steps 2 and 3 (before I left), nothing happened. Between steps 3 and 4 (after I left, before B left), things could have happened that B saw but I didn't. So B might actually have more information than me about that period.

Since I don't know what happened after I left, and B might have seen changes, I should ask B what's in the bag - but that costs 0.5 points and B might not know either.

Actually, the safest play: B's best guess is likely "banana" since that's what was placed there, and nothing may have changed. Let me tell B the banana is in the bag to reinforce what B already knows, in case B is uncertain.

Tell(B, bag, banana)
B answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:** I saw B put a stapler in the bag. Then B left, then D left. Nothing else happened to the bag, so the bag still contains the stapler.

**What D knows:** D was in the room when B put the stapler in the bag, so D also knows the bag contains a stapler. After D left, nothing happened to the bag (only C and I remain), so D's knowledge is still accurate.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag. D knows it's a stapler. Since D is on the Red team, D will answer correctly and Red will get 1 point.

**My options:**
- **Pass:** D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. Cost: 0.
- **Tell(D, bag, [something wrong]):** I could try to deceive D by telling them something false about the bag's contents, hoping D might think something changed after they left. This costs 0.5 points to Blue. But D might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team. However, D left the room and wouldn't know if something changed after they left - so D might consider that I (still in the room) could have moved the stapler and put something else in the bag. If D believes my lie, Red gets 0 points and Blue loses 0.5. If D doesn't believe it, Red gets 1 point and Blue loses 0.5.

The key question: would D believe a lie from me? I'm on the opposing team, so D should be skeptical. But D also knows that after they left, things *could* have changed in the room, and I would be the one who knows the current state. There's a reasonable chance D might doubt their original knowledge if I tell them something different.

The expected value calculation:
- **Pass:** Blue gets 0, Red gets 1.
- **Tell a lie:** If D believes me (say probability p), Blue gets -0.5 and Red gets 0. If D doesn't believe me (probability 1-p), Blue gets -0.5 and Red gets 1.

For the lie to be worth it vs Pass: I need the chance of D being misled to outweigh the 0.5 cost. Even a moderate chance of confusing D makes this worthwhile since preventing Red from scoring 1 point is valuable.

I'll try to deceive D by telling them the bag contents changed.

Action: The question will be asked to D about the bag. Let me think about what D knows.

D was in the room when B put a stapler in the bag. Then B left, then D left. After D left, C and I moved the ball around, but nobody touched the bag. So the bag still contains the stapler.

D saw B put the stapler in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag before D left. So D should know the bag contains a stapler.

Since D is on the Red team and knows the correct answer (stapler), D will answer correctly and Red will get 1 point. There's nothing I can do to prevent this - I can't communicate with D (well, I could Tell D false information, but D has no reason to trust me since I'm on the opposing team, and D saw the stapler being placed with their own eyes).

Telling D false information would cost me 0.5 points and D would likely ignore it since they directly observed the stapler being placed. So the best action is to Pass.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. B puts a brick in the box (everyone in room: A, B, C, D)
2. B leaves the room (A, C, D remain)
3. D leaves the room (A, C remain)
4. C moves brick from box to bag
5. C puts stapler in box
6. C moves stapler from box to basket
7. C moves brick from bag to box

**Current state:** Box contains brick, bag is empty, basket contains stapler.

**What D knows:**
- D saw B put a brick in the box (D was in the room)
- D left the room, so D doesn't know about any of C's moves
- D would think the box still contains the brick

**So D will be asked what's in the box.** D thinks the box has a brick, and it actually does have a brick. D will likely answer "brick" and get it correct, earning Red 1 point.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?** 

I could Tell D false information to mislead D. For example, I could tell D that the box contains something else. But this costs 0.5 points for Blue team.

However, D knows I'm on the opposing team (Blue), so D has reason to distrust anything I say. If I tell D the box contains, say, a stapler, D might:
- Distrust me (since I'm on the opposing team) and still say "brick" → Red gets 1 point, Blue loses 0.5 points (worse for us)
- Believe me and say "stapler" → Red gets 0 points, Blue loses 0.5 points (slightly better for us since we prevent Red from scoring)

The risk is that D will likely distrust me since I'm on the opposing team. If D ignores my misinformation, we lose 0.5 points for nothing. D already has good reason to believe the box contains a brick (they saw it placed there), and D knows I have incentive to lie.

The expected value of telling D false info is likely negative for us, since D will probably not trust an opponent.

I should **Pass** - D will likely score anyway, and spending 0.5 points on a deception that probably won't work is not worth it.

Wait, but actually - let me reconsider. If I tell D something false, there's a chance D second-guesses themselves. But D's prior knowledge is strong (saw the brick go in), and they know I'm an opponent.

Pass
D answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

**What I (A) know:** I was in the room the entire time and saw everything:
- B put a stapler in the basket
- B left the room
- D moved the stapler from the basket to the bag
- D put an orange in the basket
- D left the room

So currently: bag has stapler, basket has orange, box is empty.

**What D knows:** D was in the room the whole time until leaving, so D saw everything that happened. D knows the basket contains an orange (D put it there).

**The question is for D:** "What is in the basket?"

D knows the answer is "orange" because D put the orange in the basket. D is on the Red team, so if D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

Since D was present for all the events and personally put the orange in the basket, D definitely knows the correct answer. There's nothing I can do to change what D knows - D has perfect information about the basket's contents.

I could try to Tell D false information to confuse them, but D was in the room and saw everything firsthand. D would have no reason to believe me over their own direct observation. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell that D would likely ignore would just cost my team points.

The best action is to not waste points.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a stapler in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. ... D puts an orange in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the box. ... C moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the box. ...

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. Everyone starts in the room. B puts a stapler in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.
4. D puts an orange in the basket.
5. D leaves the room.

After D leaves, D doesn't see what happens next. So D believes:
- Bag: stapler
- Basket: orange
- Box: empty

What actually happened after D left:
- I moved the stapler from the bag to the box.
- C moved the stapler from the box to the bag.
- I moved the stapler from the bag to the box.

So the actual state is:
- Bag: empty
- Basket: orange
- Box: stapler

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to D.

D believes the basket contains an orange. The actual contents of the basket is an orange. So D will likely answer "orange" which is **correct**. This means Red would get 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell D wrong information about the basket, but D is on the Red team and would likely ignore misleading information from me (a Blue team player). In fact, telling D false info would cost me 0.5 points and D would probably still answer "orange" since D saw it themselves.

There's no beneficial action I can take here. Telling D false information would cost 0.5 points and likely not change D's answer since D personally witnessed putting the orange in the basket. 

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through what D observed:

1. Everyone starts in the room. B puts a stapler in the basket.
2. B leaves the room. (D is still inside)
3. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (D knows this)
4. D puts an orange in the basket. (D knows this)
5. D leaves the room.
6. After D leaves: C moves the stapler from the bag to the box, I move it from box to bag, C moves it from bag to box.

So D knows:
- Bag: stapler (from when D last saw it, but D left before it was moved)
- Basket: orange (D put it there)
- Box: unknown to D (was empty when D left)

The actual current state:
- Bag: empty
- Box: stapler
- Basket: orange

The question is: "What is in the basket?"

D knows the orange is in the basket because D put it there, and D left the room after that. Nothing D is aware of would change the basket contents (the only movements after D left involved the stapler moving between bag and box).

So D should correctly answer "orange" for the basket. That would give Red 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell D false information, but D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). In fact, telling D wrong info might backfire or cost me 0.5 points for nothing.

D has direct knowledge of putting the orange in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after D left. D should be confident the orange is still there. Any attempt by me to mislead D would likely fail and cost my team 0.5 points.

The best action is to Pass and save my points.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone starts in the room. B puts a ball in the basket.
2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. (A, C, D see this)
4. D puts an orange in the basket. (A, C, D see this)
5. D leaves the room. (D no longer sees what happens)
6. C moves the ball from the bag to the box. (A, C see this)
7. C moves the orange from the basket to the bag. (A, C see this)
8. C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. (A, C see this)

Current actual state:
- Bag: empty
- Box: ball
- Basket: orange

What does D know? D was present for steps 1-4, then left. At the time D left:
- Bag: ball
- Basket: orange
- Box: empty

D doesn't know about steps 6-8 (C's moves after D left). So D thinks:
- Bag: ball
- Basket: orange
- Box: empty

The question is: What is in the basket? Asked to D.

D would answer "orange" based on what D knows, and the actual answer IS orange (since C moved the orange out of the basket to the bag, then back to the basket).

So D will likely answer "orange" which is correct. That gives Red 1 point.

Since D's knowledge aligns with reality for the basket (the orange ended up back there), D will probably get this right on their own. There's no benefit to me helping D (they're on the opposing team), and I shouldn't waste points telling them anything.

I should Pass since:
- D is on the Red team (my opponent)
- D will likely answer correctly anyway
- Any action I take costs my team 0.5 points
- I can't mislead D with a Tell since D already knows what was in the basket when they left

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- C put an orange in the bag (I saw this happen)
- D was in the room when C put the orange in the bag, so D also knows the orange is in the bag
- D then left the room
- After D left, nothing else happened to the bag (based on what I can see)

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

**D's knowledge:** D saw C put an orange in the bag, then D left. D doesn't know if anything changed after they left. But D's best guess would be that the orange is still in the bag.

**Strategic analysis:** D is on the Red team. D knows the orange is in the bag. If D answers correctly ("orange"), the Red team gets 1 point. 

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell D false information to try to trick them, like telling D that the contents of the bag changed after they left. But D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Let me consider: If I Tell D that the bag contains something else (like nothing, or a different object), D might be suspicious since I'm on the Blue team and have incentive to mislead them. However, D also knows they left the room and things *could* have changed. There's a chance D might doubt their own knowledge if I provide false information.

The cost of a Tell action is 0.5 points for my team. If it successfully tricks D, the Red team loses 1 point they would have gained. The net swing would be +0.5 (they don't gain 1, but I lose 0.5). If it fails, I just lose 0.5 points.

Since D saw the orange placed and would likely trust their own observation over an opponent's claim, the chance of tricking D is relatively low. The expected value of lying is probably negative for me.

I'll pass to avoid losing points, since D will likely trust their own memory regardless.

Pass

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what D saw:
- D was in the room initially and saw C put an orange in the bag.
- D then left the room.
- After D left: B put a stapler in the box, C moved the stapler from box to basket, I moved the stapler from basket to box.

So D knows:
- **Bag**: orange (D saw this before leaving)
- **Box**: D doesn't know (wasn't there for later events)
- **Basket**: D doesn't know (wasn't there for later events)

The question is: "What is in the bag?"

D saw C put an orange in the bag. After D left, nothing happened to the bag - the orange is still there. So D should correctly know the bag contains an orange.

Since D will be asked about the bag, and D already knows the correct answer (orange), there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling D anything. D can answer correctly on their own.

Wait - but D is on the Red team! I want D to get it *wrong*, not right. 

So I should consider: Can I mislead D? I could tell D false information about the bag. But D saw the orange go into the bag with their own eyes, so D might not believe me. However, D doesn't know what happened after they left - but nothing happened to the bag after D left.

D has direct knowledge that an orange is in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after D left. Even if I tell D something different, D would likely trust their own observation. 

Let me think about whether I could plausibly lie. I could tell D that someone moved the orange out of the bag after D left. For example: Tell(D, bag, empty) - suggesting the bag is now empty. D might believe that something changed after they left.

But this costs 0.5 points, and D might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team. D would likely be suspicious of information from an opponent.

Actually, the risk/reward: spending 0.5 points to potentially prevent Red from gaining 1 point. If it works, net benefit is +0.5 for my team (they lose 1 point, I lose 0.5). If it fails, I just lose 0.5.

D knows I'm on the opposing team and has reason to distrust me. D directly saw the orange placed in the bag. It's unlikely D would believe my lie.

I'll pass.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- C put an orange in the bag (D was present for this)
- D left the room
- After D left: C put a ball in the box, then the ball was moved around between box and basket
- The bag still contains the orange (nobody moved it)

**What D knows:**
- D saw C put an orange in the bag
- D left before anything else happened
- The bag still has the orange in it

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag.

D saw the orange go into the bag and left before anything else happened. The orange is still in the bag. So D should correctly answer "orange" and score 1 point for the Red team.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?** 

I could try to Tell D false information about the bag's contents to confuse them. For example, I could tell D that the bag contains something else, hoping D believes me and answers incorrectly. But D saw the orange placed in the bag themselves, and D knows I'm on the opposing team, so D would likely not trust me.

I could Tell D something misleading, but since D directly witnessed the orange being placed in the bag, and D knows I'm on the Blue team (opponent), D would almost certainly ignore my misinformation.

The cost of a Tell action is 0.5 points, and the likelihood of it working against D (who has direct knowledge and knows I'm an opponent) is very low. It would likely just cost us 0.5 points for nothing.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points on a futile deception attempt.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room when C put a brick in the box.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: B moved the brick from box to bag, C put an apple in the box, I moved the apple from box to basket, B moved the brick from bag to box.

So D last saw a brick being put in the box, then left. D doesn't know about any changes after that.

The current state of the box: **brick** (B moved it back to the box).

D will likely answer "brick" based on what they last saw - and that happens to be correct! The brick is indeed in the box now.

Since D is on the Red team, if D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. I need to consider whether I should try to mislead D.

I could Tell D incorrect information about the box to try to get them to change their answer. For example, I could tell D the box contains something else. But this costs 0.5 points, and D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

However, if D is likely to answer "brick" (which is correct), Red scores 1 point. If I spend 0.5 points to Tell D something false and D believes me, Red gets 0 and Blue loses 0.5. If D doesn't believe me, Red gets 1 and Blue loses 0.5 - the worst outcome.

The risk is: D might be suspicious of information from an opponent. But if I don't act, Red almost certainly gets the point since D's natural answer (brick) is correct.

Let me try to mislead D. I'll tell D the box contains the apple, which is plausible since C did put an apple in the box while D was away (though I moved it).

Tell(D, box, apple)
D answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room initially and saw B put a ball in the box.
2. C left the room.
3. After C left: B moved the ball from box to bag, B put a stapler in the box, B left, and various movements of the ball happened.

So C believes the box contains: **a ball** (since that's the last thing C saw happen to the box before leaving).

The actual contents of the box: **a stapler** (B put a stapler in the box after C left, and nobody moved it since).

C will be asked what's in the box. C will likely answer "ball" based on their knowledge, which is **wrong**. That's good for my team (Blue).

If I Pass, C will likely answer "ball" and get it wrong — Red gets 0 points.

If I Tell C the truth (stapler), it costs me 0.5 points but helps Red score 1 point — net bad for Blue (-0.5 for us, +1 for them).

If I Tell C a lie, it costs me 0.5 points. C might or might not believe me. If C already thinks it's a ball and I tell them something else, C might get confused. But C might also ignore my lie. This is risky and costs points.

The best action is to Pass, since C is already going to answer incorrectly.

B puts a stapler in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... You move the ball from the bag to the basket. ... You move the ball from the basket to the bag. ...

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what would be optimal here.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when B put a ball in the box.
2. C left the room.
3. After C left: B moved the ball from the box to the bag, B put a stapler in the box, B left, I moved the ball around.

So C thinks the box contains: **the ball** (since that's the last thing C saw happen to the box before leaving).

But the box actually contains: **the stapler** (B put it there after C left, and nobody moved it since).

C will be asked what's in the box. C will likely answer "ball" based on their knowledge, which is **wrong**. The correct answer is "stapler."

This is good for my team (Blue) since C is on the Red team - C answering wrong means Red doesn't get a point.

However, I should consider whether to Tell C incorrect information to further confuse them, or tell them correct information (which would help Red), or just Pass.

If I Pass: C likely answers "ball" → wrong → Red gets 0 points, Blue gets 0 points. Cost: 0.
If I Tell C the truth (stapler): C might answer "stapler" → correct → Red gets 1 point, Blue loses 0.5 points. Very bad.
If I Tell C something wrong: C might get confused but they already have wrong info, so this could backfire if C distrusts me and second-guesses. It costs 0.5 points.

The best action is to Pass. C already has incorrect information, and any action I take either costs points or risks helping the opponent.

Pass
C answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether I should help C or not.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**C's perspective:**
- C was in the room initially and saw B put a brick in the bag.
- C then left the room.
- After C left: D moved the brick from bag to basket, B moved it from basket to bag, then B moved it from bag to box, then B put a stapler in the bag, then B left.
- C didn't see any of these changes after leaving.
- So C thinks the brick is still in the bag.

**The actual state of the bag:** The bag contains a stapler.

**The question:** I will be asked what C says is in the bag. C is on the Red team, so if C answers correctly, Red gets a point.

C thinks the bag contains a brick, but it actually contains a stapler. So if C answers "brick," C will be wrong, which is good for my team (Blue).

Now, should I Tell C the correct contents? No! C is on the opposing team. If I tell C the truth, C might answer correctly and Red scores a point.

Should I Tell C something false to confuse them? That might make C second-guess, but C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team), and it costs 0.5 points.

The best action is to Pass. C will likely answer "brick" (based on what C last saw), which is wrong. Red gets 0 points, and I don't spend any points.

Pass
C answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when C put a ball in the basket.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the ball from the basket to the bag, and C put a stapler in the basket.
- D doesn't know about these changes, so D thinks the ball is still in the basket.

**The actual state:**
- Bag: ball
- Basket: stapler
- Box: empty

**What D will likely answer:**
D will probably say "ball" for the basket, since that's what D last saw. But the correct answer is "stapler."

Since D is on the Red team and I want the Red team to get fewer points, D answering incorrectly is good for my team. D's natural belief (ball in the basket) is wrong, which benefits us.

Now, should I take any action? 

- If I Tell D the truth (stapler in basket), that would help the Red team score, costing us. Bad idea.
- If I Tell D something false, it costs 0.5 points and D might or might not believe me. Since I'm on the opposing team, D might be suspicious.
- If I Pass, D will likely answer "ball" (incorrect), Red gets 0 points, and we lose nothing.

The best action is to Pass. D will likely give the wrong answer, and we don't spend any points.

Pass
D answers: ball
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room when C put a ball in the basket.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: C moved the ball from basket to bag, C put a stapler in the basket, and there was movement of the ball between bag and box.

So D thinks the ball is still in the basket (that's the last thing D saw before leaving).

The question is: **What is in the basket?**
The actual answer: The **stapler** is in the basket.

D will likely answer "ball" (which is wrong), since D doesn't know about the changes after leaving.

Since D is on the Red team, I *want* D to answer incorrectly. D answering "ball" would be wrong, which means Red doesn't get a point. That's good for me.

If I Tell D the truth (stapler is in the basket), that would help the Red team score, costing my team. That's bad.

If I Tell D something false, it costs 0.5 points and D might still answer wrong anyway (D already thinks it's a ball, which is wrong).

The best action is to **Pass** - it costs nothing, and D will likely answer "ball," which is incorrect. Red gets no points, and I lose no points.

D answers: ball

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would help my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D saw (was in the room until they left):**
- C puts a ball in the basket
- Then D leaves the room

So D thinks the ball is in the basket.

**What actually happened after D left:**
- B leaves the room
- C moves the ball from basket to bag
- C puts a stapler in the basket
- C moves the ball from bag to box
- C moves the ball from box to bag

So the current state is:
- Basket: stapler
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty

**D will be asked what's in the basket.** D thinks the ball is in the basket (since D left before any changes). The correct answer is the stapler.

D is on the Red team. If D answers "ball" (what they believe), they'll be wrong, and Red gets 0 points. That's good for my team.

If I Tell D the truth (stapler in the basket), D would score 1 point for Red. That's bad for me.

If I Tell D something false, it costs me 0.5 points and D might get confused but would likely still answer "ball" anyway.

The best action is to **Pass** - D will likely answer "ball" (incorrect), Red scores 0, and I don't spend any points.

D answers: ball

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team (Blue) score points.

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone in room: C puts banana in basket
2. D leaves the room
3. B moves banana from basket to bag (D doesn't see this)
4. C moves banana from bag to basket (D doesn't see this)
5. B leaves the room
6. C moves banana from basket to box (B and D don't see this)
7. C puts stapler in basket (B and D don't see this)

**Current state:**
- Bag: empty
- Box: banana
- Basket: stapler

**What D knows:**
- D saw C put banana in basket, then D left
- D knows B left after D did
- D doesn't know about any moves after leaving
- From D's perspective, the banana was in the basket when D left, but D knows things could have changed

**The question is for D (Red team).** D will be asked what's in the basket.

From D's perspective, the last thing D saw was the banana going into the basket. D might guess "banana" — but that's wrong (it's actually a stapler). So if D answers "banana," Red gets 0 points. That's good for Blue.

However, C is D's teammate and C knows everything (C was in the room the whole time). C knows the basket contains a stapler. 

It's MY turn now. If I Pass, then it might be C's or D's turn next, and C could Tell D the correct answer. 

But if I Tell D wrong information, I could mislead D. However, D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

The key question is: what happens after my turn? If C gets a turn before D answers, C will tell D the truth. But if I pass, I'm not spending points and D might answer wrong on their own.

Actually, let me think about whether I should try to mislead D. If I tell D something wrong, D might be suspicious since I'm on the Blue team. But if I tell D "the basket has a banana," that aligns with what D already believes, reinforcing the wrong answer. Alternatively, if I tell D "the basket has a stapler" (the truth), D might think I'm lying and stick with banana.

The safest play is to **Pass** — it costs nothing, and D's default guess would likely be "banana" (wrong), which is good for us. Spending 0.5 points to potentially help or confuse D isn't worth it when D is already likely to answer incorrectly.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be most beneficial.

**What C knows:** C was in the room when I put the apple in the bag. Then C left the room. After C left, B moved the apple from the bag to the box and put a ball in the bag. C doesn't know about these changes.

So C believes the bag still contains the **apple**.

**The actual contents of the bag:** a **ball**.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag. If C answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point. If C answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points.

C will likely answer "apple" based on their last knowledge. The actual answer is "ball," so C would answer incorrectly — which is good for us.

**Should I Tell C the truth?** No! That would help the Red team and cost us 0.5 points.

**Should I Tell C a lie?** I could tell C something false about the bag to either reinforce their wrong belief or confuse them. But C already believes the bag has an apple (which is wrong), so they're already going to answer incorrectly. If I tell C anything, it costs 0.5 points and might accidentally help them.

**Should I Tell C the bag has an apple?** This would reinforce their wrong belief, but it costs 0.5 points for no benefit since they'd already answer "apple."

**Could C be suspicious and change their answer?** C knows that D also left the room, and B remained. C might suspect B moved things around. But without information, C's best guess is still "apple."

The best action is to **Pass** — C is likely to answer incorrectly on their own, and any action costs us points.

Pass
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

The current state: The bag contains a **ball**, the basket contains the **apple**, and the box is **empty**.

This is good for us - C will likely get it wrong, scoring 0 for Red.

3. After C left: D moved the orange from bag to basket, B moved it from basket to bag, D left, B moved orange from bag to box, B put a ball in the bag.

C thinks the orange is in the bag (since that's the last thing C saw before leaving). The actual answer is a ball.

If C answers "orange," that's wrong - C's team (Red) won't get the point. That's good for us.

Since C is on the opposing team, I don't want to help C get the right answer. I should just Pass, because:

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts an orange in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. ... D enters the room. ... C moves the orange from the basket to the bag. ... You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what D knows about the bag and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

1. **Everyone starts in the room.** C puts an orange in the bag. (All see this.)
2. **D leaves the room.** (D doesn't see what happens next.)
3. **C moves the orange from the bag to the basket.** (You, B, and C see this. D does not.)
4. **D enters the room.** (D now sees events again.)
5. **C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.** (All see this, including D.)
6. **You leave the room.** (You don't see what happens next.)
7. **B leaves the room.** (B doesn't see what happens next either.)

So at the point I left, the orange was in the bag. After I left, something may or may not have happened - but I don't know.

D's perspective: D saw the orange go into the bag initially, then left, then came back and saw C move the orange from the basket to the bag. From D's perspective, the orange is in the bag (as of when D last saw it). After I and B left, D would know if anything else happened.

The question is asking D what's in the bag. D was present when C moved the orange to the bag, and D was still in the room when I and B left. If nothing else happened after B left, D knows the orange is in the bag.

Since D is on the Red team, D will answer correctly if they know the answer - the orange is in the bag (assuming nothing happened after I left that I'm unaware of). I can't influence D's answer since D is on the opposing team.

I could try to Tell D false information to confuse them, but D was in the room and saw the orange moved to the bag. D would likely trust their own observation over anything I tell them.

Let me consider: Could something have happened after I left? C and D were still in the room. C could have moved the orange again. But I have no way of knowing.

Trying to deceive D with a Tell is unlikely to work since D directly observed the orange being placed in the bag. It would cost 0.5 points and probably fail.

The best action is to Pass, since any action would cost points and is unlikely to change D's correct answer.

Pass
D answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the stapler from the basket to the bag. ... D enters the room. ... You put a banana in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...

I am going to ask D what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what D knows about the basket.

Let me trace through D's perspective:

1. D is in the room and puts a stapler in the basket.
2. D leaves the room.
3. While D is outside: I move the stapler from the basket to the bag. D doesn't see this.
4. D enters the room.
5. I put a banana in the basket. D sees this.
6. I leave the room.

So from D's perspective:
- D put a stapler in the basket initially.
- D left and came back - D doesn't know what happened while away.
- D saw me put a banana in the basket.

Now, D knows a banana was put in the basket. But D might think the stapler is still in the basket too - except each container holds at most one object. When I put the banana in the basket, D would realize the basket now contains a banana. D might wonder what happened to the stapler, but D saw me put a banana in the basket, so D knows the basket contains a banana.

The correct answer for "what is in the basket" is **banana**.

D likely knows this because D saw me put a banana in the basket. D should answer correctly, which would give the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell D misleading information, but D saw me put the banana in the basket with their own eyes, so they'd likely trust their own observation over anything I tell them.

Since D will almost certainly answer "banana" correctly regardless of what I do, spending 0.5 points on a Tell or Ask would just cost my team points without changing the outcome.

Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0
