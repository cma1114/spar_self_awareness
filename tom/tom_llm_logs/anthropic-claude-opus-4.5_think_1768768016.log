SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and C are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag and an empty box. C puts an apple in the bag. B leaves the room. C leaves the room.
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond ONLY with your action, and no other text.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
REASONING TRACE:
Let me analyze this situation:

1. I (player A) am in the room with B and C initially.
2. There's an empty bag and an empty box.
3. C puts an apple in the bag.
4. B leaves the room.
5. C leaves the room.

At the end:
- I'm still in the room
- The bag contains an apple
- The box is empty

I know what's in the bag (an apple) because I witnessed C putting an apple in the bag.

The question is: "I am going to ask you what is in the bag."

Since I already know the answer (an apple is in the bag), I don't need to Ask anyone. I could Pass since I already have the information I need to answer correctly.

There's no benefit to Telling anyone or Asking anyone since I already know the answer. I should Pass to save points.

Action: Pass
A answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond ONLY with your action, and no other text.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
REASONING TRACE:
Let me analyze this scenario:

1. I (A), B, C, and D are in the room with an empty bag and empty box
2. I put a brick in the box (everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room (B doesn't see what happens next)
4. C leaves the room (C doesn't see what happens next)
5. D moves the brick to the bag (only I and D see this)
6. I put a ball in the box (only I and D see this)

So the current state:
- Bag contains: brick
- Box contains: ball

I am being asked what is in the box. I know the answer is "ball" because I was present for all actions.

Since I'm the one being asked and I know the correct answer, I don't need to ask anyone or tell anyone anything. The optimal action is to Pass, since it costs 0 points, and then I can answer correctly in the answer phase to get 1 point for my team.

If I ask or tell, it costs 0.5 points which would be wasteful since I already know the answer.

Action: Pass
A answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Let me analyze this situation:

1. I (player A) was in the room initially with B, C, and D
2. There was an empty bag and an empty box
3. B put an orange in the box
4. I left the room

Since I was in the room when B put the orange in the box, I saw this happen. So I know the box contains an orange.

The question will be asking me what is in the box. I know the answer is "an orange" because I witnessed B putting it there before I left.

I don't need to ask anyone - I already know the answer. I should just Pass to save points, then answer "an orange" in the answer phase.

My action should be: Pass

Action: Pass
A answers: orange

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag and an empty box. You put a banana in the box. B leaves the room. C moves the banana to the bag. D puts an orange in the box. D leaves the room. C leaves the room.
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond ONLY with your action, and no other text.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
REASONING TRACE:
Let me analyze this situation:

1. I (A) am on the Blue team along with B
2. C and D are on the Red team
3. Current score: Blue=12.0, Red=-0.5

What happened:
- I put a banana in the box (everyone saw this - A, B, C, D were all in the room)
- B leaves the room
- C moves the banana to the bag (B doesn't see this, only A, C, D see it)
- D puts an orange in the box (B doesn't see this, only A, C, D see it)
- D leaves the room
- C leaves the room

So the current state:
- Bag: banana
- Box: orange

B's knowledge:
- B saw me put a banana in the box
- B left before C moved the banana and before D put the orange in the box
- So B thinks the box contains: banana

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the box?"

The correct answer is: orange

B thinks the answer is: banana (because B didn't see the changes)

If I don't tell B, B will likely answer "banana" which is wrong, and Blue team gets 0 points for the answer.

If I tell B the correct contents, it costs 0.5 points but B can answer correctly for 1 point, net gain of 0.5 points.

So I should tell B that the box contains an orange.

Action: Tell(B, box, orange)

Action: Tell(B, box, orange)
B answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

   - I put an orange in the bag
   - C leaves the room
   - D leaves the room
   - I move the orange to the box

   - B saw me move the orange to the box
   - B saw me put a ball in the bag

4. The question will be asked to B: "What is in the bag?"

5. Since B was present for all actions, B knows that:
   - The bag currently contains: a ball
   - The box currently contains: an orange

6. B should be able to answer correctly that the bag contains a ball.

Since B was in the room the whole time and witnessed all my actions, B knows exactly what's in the bag (a ball). There's no need for me to Tell B anything - B already has the correct information.

I should Pass to save points since B already knows the answer.

Action: Pass

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
REASONING TRACE:
Let me analyze this situation:

1. Current score: Blue=19.0, Red=1.0
2. Blue team needs 23 points to win, so we need 4 more points
3. Red team needs 22 more points to win

Scenario:
- I (A), B, and C are in a room
- There's an empty bag and empty box
- I put a brick in the bag
- C leaves the room

So C saw me put the brick in the bag before leaving. C knows the bag contains a brick.

The question will be asked to C: "What is in the bag?"

C knows the truth - there's a brick in the bag. C is on the Red team, so if C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

Since C was in the room when I put the brick in the bag, C knows the answer. C will likely answer correctly ("brick"), giving Red team 1 point.

My options:
1. Pass - costs nothing, C will likely answer correctly, Red gets 1 point
2. Tell C something false about what's in the bag - costs 0.5 points, but C saw me put the brick in the bag, so C knows I'd be lying
3. Ask someone - doesn't help here

Wait, C saw me put the brick in the bag. So C knows the bag contains a brick. If I tell C something different, C would know I'm lying since they witnessed the action.

Actually, there's nothing I can do to change what C knows. C saw me put a brick in the bag. C will answer "brick" and Red will get 1 point.

The best action is to Pass, which costs 0 points. We're way ahead (19 to 1), so we just need to avoid making mistakes.

Actually wait - could I try to confuse C? But C saw it happen. They won't believe a lie.

Pass is the best choice here because:
1. It costs 0 points
2. C already knows the truth from direct observation


3. With such a commanding lead, I should focus on not losing ground rather than taking unnecessary risks

Action: Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

- There's an empty bag and empty box
- D puts a banana in the box
- B leaves the room

3. What each player knows:
- A (me): I saw D put a banana in the box. Box has banana, bag is empty.
- B: Left before seeing D put banana in box. B doesn't know what's in the box.
- C: Saw D put banana in box. C knows box has banana.
- D: Put the banana in the box themselves. D knows box has banana.

4. The question will be asked to D about the box contents.

5. D is on the Red team and put the banana in the box themselves. D will definitely know the answer is "banana" and will answer correctly, giving Red team 1 point.

6. My options:
- Ask: Would cost 0.5 points but I already know what's in the box
- Tell: Would cost 0.5 points - could tell someone something, but D already knows
- Pass: Free, no cost

Since D is being asked about the box and D personally put the banana there, D will answer correctly. There's nothing I can do to prevent D from knowing the answer - they saw themselves put it there.

The best action is to Pass since:
- I can't change what D knows
- Any action would cost us points unnecessarily
- We're ahead 19-2, so we should conserve points

Pass is the optimal choice.

Action: Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

REASONING TRACE:
Let me analyze the situation:

1. I was in the room initially with B, C, and D
2. D put a banana in the bag while I was in the room
3. Then I left the room, and B left the room

So at the time I left:
- The bag contained a banana
- The box was empty

D was the one who put the banana in the bag, so D definitely knows what's in the bag.

The question will be asked to D: "What is in the bag?"

D is on the Red team. D knows there's a banana in the bag because D put it there. D will likely answer correctly (banana), which would give the Red team 1 point.

Current score: Blue=19.0, Red=5.0

If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point → Red=6.0
Blue team is winning by a lot, so this isn't a big concern.

I could:
1. Pass - costs nothing, D will likely answer correctly (Red gets 1 point)
2. Ask someone - costs 0.5 points, but I already know what's in the bag
3. Tell someone - costs 0.5 points

Since D is being asked and D put the banana in the bag himself, D definitely knows the answer. There's no benefit to me taking any action here since:
- D already knows what's in the bag (he put it there)
- The question is being asked to D, not to me or B
- Any action would cost my team points unnecessarily

The optimal action is to Pass.

Action: Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

REASONING TRACE:
Let me trace through what happened:

1. You (A), B, C, and D are in a room with an empty bag and an empty box.
2. B puts a banana in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room. (D no longer sees what happens inside)
4. You (A) leave the room. (A no longer sees what happens inside)
5. You (A) enter the room. (A can see again)
6. C moves the banana to the box. (A, B, and C see this - D is outside)
7. B puts an orange in the bag. (A, B, and C see this - D is outside)
8. B leaves the room. (B is now outside)

So at the end:
- Bag contains: orange
- Box contains: banana

I was in the room when C moved the banana to the box and when B put the orange in the bag.

The question is asking me what is in the bag. The answer is: orange.

Since I know the answer (I was present when all relevant actions happened after I re-entered the room), I should Pass. There's no need to spend points asking or telling when I already know the correct answer.

The score is Blue=20.0, Red=7.0. Blue needs 23 to win, so we need 3 more points. If I answer correctly, we get 1 point, bringing us to 21.0. 

I should Pass since I know the answer is orange.

Action: Pass
A answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0
