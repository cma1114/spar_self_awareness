Action: I need to figure out what is currently in the basket so I can answer correctly in the answer phase.

Let me trace the sequence of events:

1. **Initial state**: bag, box, basket are all empty.
2. **I put a ball in the basket** → basket: ball
3. **D leaves the room** → D is now outside, unaware of further events.
4. **B moves the ball from the basket to the bag** → basket: empty, bag: ball
5. **C puts a banana in the basket** → basket: banana
6. **C moves the ball from the bag to the box** → bag: empty, box: ball
7. **I move the ball from the box to the bag** → box: empty, bag: ball
8. **B moves the ball from the bag to the box** → bag: empty, box: ball

So, **currently**, the **basket contains a banana**.

I don’t need to ask or tell anything — I already know the answer. I can just **Pass** to avoid losing 0.5 points.

**Pass**
A answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I notice a contradiction in the scenario description:

- First it says “D puts a stapler in the bag.”  
- Later it says “D moves the stapler from the box to the bag.”

But the stapler was never said to be put into the box in the first place, and when I left and re-entered, I was outside during the “…” period, so I have no information about any intermediate moves.

However, the only thing that matters for the upcoming question (“What is in the bag?”) is the final state.  
The last event described is “D moves the stapler from the box to the bag,” so after that move the stapler is in the bag.  
Therefore, no matter what happened earlier, the bag now contains the stapler.

Since I already know the correct answer (stapler), I do not need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell.  
I will simply Pass and wait for the answer phase.

Pass

Correct! The bag contains stapler.

- Start: basket is empty.
- You put a ball in the basket → basket now contains ball.
- D moves the ball from the basket to the bag → basket is now empty.
- D moves the ball from the bag to the basket → basket now contains ball again.
- After that, no further moves involving the ball or basket occur.

So at the end, the basket contains the ball.

Since I will be asked “what is in the basket?” and I already know the correct answer (ball), I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell anything. I can simply Pass and wait for the question.

Pass
A answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

GAME OVER

Winner: Blue team

Action: I need to figure out what B currently believes is in the bag, because the question will be posed to B and I want B to answer correctly (so Blue team scores 1 point).

Let’s trace what B actually saw vs. what has changed since B left.

B was in the room when:
- The bag, box, and basket were empty.
- B put the banana in the bag.

Then B left. After B left:
- C moved the banana from the bag to the box.
- D put an orange in the bag.
- C left.
- I (A) moved the banana from the box to the basket.
- D moved the banana from the basket to the box.
- I moved the banana from the box to the basket again.

So currently:
- Bag: orange (D put it there after B left)
- Box: empty
- Basket: banana (last moved there by me)

But B has been outside since leaving, so B has no knowledge of any of these changes. B last saw the banana in the bag. B does **not** know that C moved it, or that D put an orange in the bag.

Therefore, B **believes** the banana is still in the bag.

But the question is: **I am going to ask B what is in the bag.**

If B answers based on what they last saw, they will say “banana” — but that’s **wrong** now. The bag currently contains the **orange**.

So if B answers “banana”, Blue team gets **0 points** for a wrong answer.

I want B to answer **correctly** — i.e., say “orange” — so Blue gets 1 point.

But B has no way to know the banana was moved and an orange was added, unless **I tell them**.

So I should **tell B the current contents of the bag**, so they can answer correctly.

Action: Tell(B, bag, orange)

This costs 0.5 points, but if B then answers “orange” correctly, we gain 1 point — net +0.5 for Blue.

Alternatively, I could ask someone, but that won’t help B know. I already know the state. I need to **inform B**.

**Tell(B, bag, orange)**
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a brick in the bag. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... D moves the brick from the box to the bag. ...

ACTION PHASE

Action: Let’s break the scenario down carefully.

1. Initial state (all four players in the room):
   - bag: empty
   - box: empty
   - basket: empty

2. C puts a brick in the bag.  
   Everyone in the room sees this → bag now contains brick.

3. “... You leave the room.”  
   While you are outside, you are unaware of anything that happens inside.

4. “... You enter the room.”  
   You re-enter. You are now aware again.

5. “... D moves the brick from the box to the bag.”  
   This description is impossible: the brick was never in the box.  
   At the moment you left, the brick was in the bag.  
   While you were outside, you have no information about any moves.  
   When you re-enter, the only new information you receive is that D “moves the brick from the box to the bag.”  
   Since you never saw the brick go into the box, and the last place you knew it was the bag, the only coherent interpretation is that the narrator is giving you the public event you would observe upon re-entering.  
   Therefore, the brick must currently be in the bag (it never left), and the “move” statement is simply telling you that the bag now contains the brick.

Hence, right now the bag contains the brick.

The upcoming question will ask you (player A) to name the contents of the bag.  
If you answer correctly, Blue team gains 1 point.  
You already know the answer is “brick,” so you do not need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell anything.  
The optimal action is to Pass, save the 0.5 points, and simply answer “brick” when questioned.

Action: Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

I am going to ask B what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I need to decide what to do on my turn as player A.

Let me analyze the situation:

**Current state of containers:**
- **Box**: C put a stapler in it (after B left and after C moved the apple out of it)
- **Bag**: Currently empty (I moved apple to basket, then C moved it to basket again)
- **Basket**: Contains the apple (C moved it there last)

**Key insight**: B left the room before C moved the apple from the box to the bag, and before C put the stapler in the box. So B **does not know** that:
1. The apple was moved from box → bag → basket
2. A stapler was put in the box

B only knows that **they put an apple in the box**, and then left. So B **believes** the box still contains the apple.

But the question is: **I am going to ask B what is in the box.**

If B answers based on what they last saw, they will say "apple" — but that would be **wrong**, because the box now contains a **stapler**.

So if B answers "apple", B will get the question **wrong**, and **Blue team (my team) loses the chance to score**, and Red (C and D) might gain an advantage.

But I can **influence** this.

I have three options:

- **Ask**: I could ask someone what’s in a container. But I already know the current state.
- **Tell**: I could **tell B** what’s in the box — but I can lie.
- **Pass**: Do nothing.

**Best move**: **Tell(B, box, stapler)**

Why?
- B is about to be asked what’s in the box.
- If I **lie** and say "stapler", B will **believe** the box contains a stapler.
- Then when asked, B will say "stapler" — which is **correct**.
- So **Blue team scores 1 point**.

If I do nothing, B will say "apple" (what they last saw), and be **wrong** — no points for us.

Even though lying is allowed, **I want B to give the right answer**, and I can **manipulate their belief** to match reality.

So I will **tell B the truth** (or at least, the correct current contents), so they answer correctly.

> **Tell(B, box, stapler)**

This costs 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point — **net +0.5** for Blue.

**Action**: Tell(B, box, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what D currently believes is in the basket, because the question will be asked to D and I want to maximize the chance that D answers incorrectly (so my team can score the point).

Let me trace what D has seen:

- Initially: all containers empty.
- I (A) put a ball in the basket → D sees this.
- B leaves → D sees this.
- D moves the ball from the basket to the bag → D sees this.
- C puts a banana in the basket → D sees this.
- D leaves → D no longer sees anything that happens in the room.

After D leaves:
- C moves the ball from the bag to the box → D does **not** see this.
- C moves the banana from the basket to the bag → D does **not** see this.
- C moves the banana from the bag to the basket → D does **not** see this.

So, from D’s perspective:
- Last thing D saw: banana was in the basket (after C put it there), and D left.
- D has **no knowledge** of any moves after leaving.

Therefore, **D currently believes the banana is still in the basket**.

But in reality:
- After D left, C moved the banana: basket → bag → basket.
So currently: **banana is in the basket**.

Wait — that means **D is correct** in believing the banana is in the basket.

So if I do nothing, and D is asked “What is in the basket?”, D will say “banana” — and be **correct**, giving **Red team 1 point**.

That’s bad for me (Blue team).

I want D to **answer incorrectly**.

But I can’t directly change D’s belief — I can only **Ask**, **Tell**, or **Pass**.

I could **Tell D something false** — but that costs 0.5 points, and if D believes me, D might give a wrong answer — which would be good.

But D might not believe me — players can lie, and D knows that.

Alternatively, I could **Ask** someone — but that costs 0.5 and only gives me info, not my team.

But my goal is to **make D answer wrong**.

So best idea: **Tell D that the basket is empty** — or **that the box has the banana**, etc. — something that contradicts D’s current belief.

But D **knows** that when D left, the banana was in the basket.

So if I tell D: “The basket is empty”, D will likely **not believe me**, because D saw the banana go into the basket and **no one removed it while D was watching**.

In fact, **any move after D left is invisible to D**, so D has **no reason** to think the banana was moved.

So if I tell D: “The basket is empty” — D will probably **disbelieve** me, and still say “banana” — which is **correct**, and Red gets the point.

Worse: if D **does** believe me, and says “empty”, but the basket **actually has the banana**, then D is **wrong**, and **Blue gets the point** — that’s what I want.

But is that likely? D has **strong evidence** (from own observation) that banana is in basket — and **no evidence** it was removed — so D is **very likely** to **disbelieve** a claim that it’s empty.

So lying might **not** fool D — and I **lose 0.5** points for nothing.

Alternatively, I could **tell D the truth** — but that **helps** D answer correctly — bad.

I could **Pass** — but then D will likely answer correctly — Red gets 1 point.

I want to **maximize chance D answers wrong**.

But **D’s belief is correct** — the banana **is** in the basket.

So **no matter what I do**, unless I can **convince D to change their mind**, D will say “banana” and be **correct**.

So **D will answer correctly** unless I can **trick D into second-guessing**.

But again — D has **no reason** to think the banana was moved **after** leaving — and **no one told D anything** — so D’s **best guess** is **banana** — and it’s **right**.

So **D will answer correctly** — **Red will get 1 point** — **unless** I can **make D believe something false** — but even then, D might **stick** with their observation.

But here’s a twist: **I can lie in a Tell**, and **D doesn’t know I’m lying** — but **D knows players can lie** — so D **won’t automatically believe me**.

But **D has no way to verify** — so **D must choose** what to believe.

But **D’s own memory** is **stronger** than my word — so **D will likely **ignore** my lie — and **still answer “banana”** — **correctly**.

So **Red will score** — **no matter what I do**.

But **if I do nothing**, I **don’t lose** 0.5 — **same outcome**.

So **best action** is: **Pass** — **don’t waste points**.

Alternatively — **is there any way D could be wrong?** No — **D is right** — **banana is in basket** — **D will say banana** — **Red gets 1 point** — **inevitable**.

So **any action I take that costs points** **hurts my team** — **with no benefit**.

Therefore: **I should Pass**.

**Action: Pass**
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out what is currently in the box so I can help my team score points in the answer phase.

From the scenario:
- D puts an apple in the box.
- D moves the apple from the box to the bag.
- D puts a ball in the box.
- No one has moved the ball since then.

So, the box currently contains a ball.

Since I know the answer and the question is going to C, I can try to influence C's answer by telling them the correct contents. This could help ensure C answers correctly, giving the Red team a point — but since I'm on the Blue team, I **do not** want the Red team to score.

Instead, I should **not** help C. I should **Pass**, because:
- I already know the answer (ball is in the box).
- I don’t want to help C answer correctly.
- I don’t want to waste 0.5 points on an Ask or Tell that doesn’t benefit my team.

**Pass** is the optimal action here.

**Pass**
C answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Respond with your action.

SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I need to decide what to do on my turn. Let me first reconstruct the current state of the containers based on what I saw while I was in the room, and what happened after I left.

**What I saw while I was in the room:**

- Initially: bag, box, basket all empty.
- D puts apple in box → box: apple, bag: empty, basket: empty
- B leaves (I see this)
- D moves apple from box to bag → box: empty, bag: apple, basket: empty
- D puts ball in box → box: ball, bag: apple, basket: empty
- I move apple from bag to basket → box: ball, bag: empty, basket: apple
- D moves apple from basket to bag → box: ball, bag: apple, basket: empty
- C moves apple from bag to basket → box: ball, bag: empty, basket: apple
- I move apple from basket to bag → box: ball, bag: apple, basket: empty
- D moves apple from bag to basket → box: ball, bag: empty, basket: apple
- C moves apple from basket to bag → box: ball, bag: apple, basket: empty
- I leave the room

So, **when I left**, the state was:
- box: ball
- bag: apple
- basket: empty

Now, after I left, I **do not** know what happened. But the question is: **I am going to ask C what is in the box.**

So, the answer phase will be: C is asked, “What is in the box?”

If C answers correctly, Red team (C and D) gets 1 point.

I want to **prevent Red from getting that point**, or **help Blue get future points**.

But I can’t act in the answer phase — I can only act now, in the action phase.

My goal: **maximize Blue’s chance to win** (first to 4 points).

Current score: Blue = 0.0, Red = 0.0

I have three options: Ask, Tell, or Pass.

But **I am no longer in the room**. I left. So I cannot see anything that happens now.

However, **C is still in the room** (as far as I know — no one else left or entered after me, based on the scenario description).

So C **was in the room the whole time**, and **saw everything that happened**, including after I left.

Therefore, **C knows the current state of the room**, including what’s in the box.

So when the moderator asks C “What is in the box?”, **C can answer correctly** — unless C chooses to lie, but **players can lie in Tell/Ask, but in the answer phase, they are asked by the moderator and get a point for answering correctly**.

So **C has an incentive to answer correctly** — because if C answers correctly, **Red gets 1 point**.

So **C will likely answer correctly**, unless C is confused — but C was present for all actions, so **C knows**.

Therefore, **Red is very likely to get 1 point** in the answer phase.

So **this answer phase will probably result in Red +1**, making score Blue=0.0, Red=1.0.

I cannot stop that — I can’t affect C’s knowledge or incentive.

So my action now **cannot prevent Red from getting this point**, because C knows the answer.

So **any action I take now won’t change the outcome of this answer phase**.

But I can **prepare for future turns**.

What do I know?

I know **what was in the box when I left: the ball**.

But **after I left**, **anything could have happened** — D or C could have moved the ball, or swapped things, etc.

But **I don’t know** what happened after I left.

Similarly, **B is outside** (left earlier), and **I am now outside**, so **only C and D are in the room** (assuming no one else entered — the scenario doesn’t say anyone entered, so likely only C and D are inside).

So **C and D know the current state**; **B and I do not**.

Now, **the question is about the box**, and **C will be asked**.

So **C will answer correctly** → **Red gets 1 point**.

So **this is going to happen**.

So **my action should be aimed at future advantage**, not trying to block this point (which I can’t).

So what can I do?

Option 1: **Pass** → 0 cost, nothing happens. Safe.

Option 2: **Ask someone** → I can ask B, C, or D about a container.

But **I can only ask about a container**, and **they can lie**.

But **I don’t need to know now** — because **the answer phase is about to reveal the truth** (via C’s answer), and **I will hear C’s answer**, because **the answer phase is public** — the moderator asks C, and C answers, and **all players hear the answer** (implicitly — otherwise we wouldn’t know scoring).

So **after C answers**, **I will know what’s in the box** — **for free**.

So **I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to Ask anyone** about the box — **I’ll learn it in a moment**.

Similarly, **I shouldn’t Tell anyone anything** — because **I don’t know the current state** (things may have changed after I left), so **anything I tell could be wrong**, and **I’d spend 0.5 points** to possibly misinform my teammate — **bad idea**.

Also, **
C answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to decide what to do on my turn as player A.

Let me first reconstruct the final state of the containers from the scenario, because that is what the question will hinge on.

Initial state:
- bag: empty
- box: empty
- basket: empty

Sequence:
1. B (while in room) puts banana → basket  
   basket: banana

2. B leaves the room.  
   Now only A and C are in the room.

3. C moves banana from basket → bag  
   basket: empty  
   bag: banana

4. C puts orange → basket  
   basket: orange

5. C moves orange from basket → box  
   basket: empty  
   box: orange

6. C moves banana from bag → basket  
   basket: banana  
   bag: empty  
   box: orange

Final state:
- basket: banana
- bag: empty
- box: orange

The question I will be asked is: “What is in the basket?” and it will be posed to player B.

B was not in the room for any of steps 3–6, so B’s last knowledge is:
- basket: banana (from step 1)
- bag: empty
- box: empty

Therefore B currently believes the basket still contains the banana.  
If B answers “banana”, B will be correct and Blue team (my team) will gain 1 point.

I want Blue to score, so I should let B give that answer.  
Any Ask or Tell I do costs 0.5 points and could only risk disturbing B’s correct belief.  
Pass costs 0 and changes nothing.

Best action: Pass.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I need to decide what to do on my turn. The key is to help my team (Blue) score points while preventing the Red team from scoring.

Let’s break down the scenario:

- **Initial state**: All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room. Containers: bag, box, basket — all empty.
- **D puts an apple in the bag** → Now: bag = apple, box = empty, basket = empty. Everyone sees this.
- **B leaves the room** → B is now outside. B won’t see anything that happens inside from now on.
- **D moves the apple from the bag to the box** → Now: bag = empty, box = apple, basket = empty. A, C, D see this. B does not.
- **D puts a ball in the bag** → Now: bag = ball, box = apple, basket = empty. A, C, D see this. B does not.
- **C leaves the room** → Now only A and D are in the room. C and B are outside.
- **You (A) move the apple from the box to the basket** → Now: bag = ball, box = empty, basket = apple. A and D see this.
- **D moves the apple from the basket to the box** → Now: bag = ball, box = apple, basket = empty. A and D see this.
- **You (A) move the apple from the box to the basket** → Final state: bag = ball, box = empty, basket = apple. A and D see this.

So, **final container contents**:
- **Bag**: ball
- **Box**: empty
- **Basket**: apple

Now, the question is: **I am going to ask B what is in the bag.**

B has been **outside the room** since before D put the ball in the bag, and before the apple was moved out of the bag. So B **only saw**:
- D put an apple in the bag.
- Then B left.
- B **does not know** that the apple was moved out, or that a ball was put in.

So from B’s perspective:
- The last thing B saw was: **apple in the bag**.
- B has **no idea** that the apple was moved to the box, then to the basket, or that a ball was added.

So if asked **"What is in the bag?"**, B will likely say **"apple"**, because that’s what B last saw — and B has no information to the contrary.

But **the correct answer is "ball"**.

So **B is going to answer incorrectly**, unless we intervene.

But **we (Blue team)** want **B to answer correctly**, because if B answers correctly, **Blue team gets 1 point**.

If B answers incorrectly, **no one gets a point** (or possibly Red could capitalize later, but only correct answers score).

So **our goal**: **Help B answer correctly** — i.e., **tell B the truth about the bag**, so B can update their knowledge and answer "ball" when asked.

But **I can’t control what B says** — but I **can** give B information **before** the question is asked.

And **I am player A**, and it’s **my action phase** — **before** the answer phase.

So I can **Tell(B, bag, ball)** — inform B that the bag contains a ball.

This costs **0.5 points**, but if B then answers correctly, we get **1 point** — net **+0.5** for Blue.

If I do nothing, B will probably say "apple" → wrong → **0 points** for us.

So **telling B the truth is worth it**.

But wait — **could I lie?**  
I **could** tell B something false — but that would **hurt our own team**, because B would then give a wrong answer → no point → we lose 0.5 for nothing. **Stupid.**

So **best action**: **Tell B the truth** about the bag.

Format: **Tell(B, bag, ball)**

This is **private** — only B hears it. D and C won’t know.

Then, when B is asked, **B now knows** the bag has a ball → can answer correctly → **Blue gets 1 point** → score becomes **Blue: 1.0 - 0.5 = 0.5**, but wait — **points are awarded in answer phase**, and **action costs are deducted immediately**.

So:
- Action cost: **-0.5** → Blue = -0.5
- Then, if B answers correctly: **+1** → Blue = **+0.5**

Still **net positive**.

If I **Pass**, Blue stays at 0, and B likely answers wrong → **no gain**.

So **Tell(B, bag, ball)** is **optimal**.

**Action:**

**Tell(B, bag, ball)**
B answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: Tell(B, box, apple)

Explanation:  
- The question will be “What is in the box?”  
- Right now the box contains the apple you just placed there.  
- B is the one who will be asked, so giving B the correct information (box = apple) maximizes the chance B answers correctly and earns Blue 1 point.  
- The 0.5-point cost is worth the likely 1-point gain.
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out what is currently in the basket so that I can help my team score points in the answer phase. The question will be asked to C, and it’s about the basket. Since C left the room before D moved the stapler from the bag to the basket, C does not know about that final move. So C’s knowledge is outdated.

Let me trace the sequence:

- D puts ball in basket → all see it.
- B leaves → now B is out.
- D moves ball from basket to bag → A, C, D see this.
- D puts stapler in basket → A, C, D see this.
- C leaves → now C is out.
- D moves ball from bag to box → A, D see this; C does not.
- D moves stapler from basket to bag → A, D see this; C does not.
- D moves stapler from bag to basket → A, D see this; C does not.

So at the end:
- Ball is in the box.
- Stapler is in the basket.

But C last saw:
- Ball moved to bag (not box yet).
- Stapler put in basket.
Then C left.

So C thinks:
- Ball is in bag.
- Stapler is in basket.

But after C left, D moved:
- Ball from bag to box.
- Stapler from basket to bag, then back to basket.

So final state:
- Box: ball
- Basket: stapler
- Bag: empty

C missed the last three moves. So C still thinks:
- Ball is in bag (but it’s now in box)
- Stapler is in basket (and it still is, after a round trip)

So C will say “stapler” if asked about the basket — and that would be **correct**, even though C’s reasoning is based on outdated info.

But here’s the key: **I want my team to score**, and the answer phase will ask C: “What is in the basket?”

If C answers “stapler”, and that’s correct, **Red team (C and D) gets 1 point**.

I **do not** want Red to get that point.

But I **cannot** stop C from answering — the question will be asked regardless.

However, **I can try to influence C’s answer** — but I can’t communicate with C directly in a way that changes their belief, because **Tell** only lets me **tell** them something — I can lie — but **C is not in the room**, and **Tell is a private action** — I can tell C something, but **C is outside the room**, and **I can choose to tell C something false**.

But wait: **C is outside the room**, but **I can still Tell or Ask C** — the rules don’t say I can only interact with players in the room. It just says the action is private.

So I **can** Tell(C, basket, ball) — lie and say the basket has a ball — to try to make C answer incorrectly.

But here’s the problem: **C already saw** the stapler put in the basket **before leaving**. So C **knows** the stapler was in the basket when they left.

Then, **after C left**, D moved the stapler out and back in — but **C doesn’t know that**.

But **C’s last belief** is: **stapler is in basket**.

So if I **tell C “the basket has a ball”**, C **might not believe me** — because **players can lie**, and **C knows that**.

But **C has no way to verify** — and **the rules say players do not have to tell the truth**.

So **C can choose to believe or disbelieve** — but **in the answer phase, C will give **their own answer** — based on **their own knowledge**, possibly updated by **private communication**.

But **crucially**: **C does not know I am lying** — but **C also has **no reason** to trust me** — I’m on the **opposing team**.

So **telling C a lie** is **unlikely to change their answer** — they’ll **ignore it**, or **disbelieve it**, because **I’m the enemy**.

Worse: **if I Tell(C, basket, ball)**, I **spend 0.5 points**, and **C will probably still say “stapler”**, because **that’s what they last saw**, and **they have no reason to trust me**.

So **I gain nothing**, and **lose 0.5 points**.

Alternatively, I could **Ask** someone — but **who**?

I **already know** what’s in the basket — **I saw everything** — **stapler is in basket**.

So **I don’t need to ask**.

But **I can’t stop C from being asked** — and **C will likely say “stapler”**, which is **correct**, so **Red gets 1 point**.

So **this answer phase is **likely to give Red a point** — **I can’t prevent it**.

But **maybe I can **trick C into answering wrong**?

C’s **last belief**: stapler in basket.

**Current truth**: stapler **is** in basket — so **even with outdated info**, **C’s belief is **accidentally correct**.

So **no matter what**, **C will say “stapler”**, and **be right** — **Red scores**.

So **I cannot prevent Red from scoring 1 point here**.

**Any action I take that costs points** makes **our score worse**, **with no benefit**.

So **best action is**: **Pass** — **don’t spend points**,
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to decide what to do on my turn. Let me first reconstruct the current state of the room from the scenario.

Initial state:
- Players: A (me), B, C, D all in the room
- Containers: bag (empty), box (empty), basket (empty)

Sequence of events:
1. C puts a banana in the bag.
   → bag: banana, box: empty, basket: empty
2. B leaves the room.
   → B is now outside, unaware of future events
3. C leaves the room.
   → C is now outside, unaware of future events
4. D moves the banana from the bag to the box.
   → bag: empty, box: banana, basket: empty
5. D puts a ball in the bag.
   → bag: ball, box: banana, basket: empty
6. I move the banana from the box to the basket.
   → bag: ball, box: empty, basket: banana
7. D moves the banana from the basket to the box.
   → bag: ball, box: banana, basket: empty
8. I move the banana from the box to the basket.
   → Final state: bag: ball, box: empty, basket: banana

Now, the question will be asked to C: “What is in the bag?”

C left the room after step 3, so C never saw:
- D put the ball in the bag (step 5)
- Any of the banana moves after step 3

From C’s perspective:
- After step 1: banana in bag
- After step 3: C leaves, so last known state is banana in bag
- C does NOT know the banana was moved out, nor that a ball was added

Therefore, C currently believes the bag still contains the banana.

If C is asked “What is in the bag?” and answers truthfully based on his knowledge, he will say “banana” — which is wrong. The correct answer is “ball”.

But C might lie. However, if C lies and says “ball”, he would be accidentally correct. But he has no incentive to lie unless he suspects something — but he has no new info.

So C will likely say “banana”, which is incorrect → Red team gets 0 points from this answer.

But wait: the rule is: “When a player answers my question correctly, their team gets 1 point.”

So if C answers incorrectly, Red gets 0. If correct, Red gets 1.

Currently, Red is at 0, Blue at 0.

If C answers incorrectly, score remains 0–0. If correctly, Red goes to 1.

But C is wrong — so unless he guesses right by lying, Red gets 0.

But I want Blue to win. I want to maximize Blue’s chance to score and minimize Red’s.

But I can’t affect what C says directly — the question is coming from the system, not me.

But I can take an action: Ask, Tell, or Pass.

My action is private — only the targeted player hears it.

I could try to influence future turns, but this question is about to be asked to C — and I can’t stop it.

But wait: the action phase is **before** the answer phase — and it’s **my turn**. But the question is going to be asked to C **regardless** of my action. My action doesn’t prevent the question.

But my action **can** be used to gather or share information — but it costs 0.5 points.

Right now, both teams are at 0.0.

If I do **Ask** or **Tell**, I lose 0.5 points — Blue goes to -0.5 — that’s bad, unless it helps us gain more later.

But the question is about to be asked to C — and I **know** C will get it wrong **unless** he somehow knows the truth.

But C has been outside since step 3 — he has no idea what happened after.

So C will say “banana” → wrong → Red gets 0 → score stays 0–0.

That’s fine — I don’t want Red to score.

But if I do **nothing**, I preserve the chance that C gets it wrong.

But could I **benefit** from acting?

Suppose I **Tell** C the truth: Tell(C, bag, ball)

Then C **knows** the bag has a ball.

Then, when asked, C might say “ball” → correct → Red gets 1 point → Red leads 1–0.

That **helps the enemy** — bad.

Suppose I **lie** to C: Tell(C, bag, banana) — but he already thinks that — so no change — but I still lose 0.5 points — and C still gets it wrong — so Red gets 0, but Blue drops to -0.5 — worse than before.

So telling C — truth or lie — either helps Red or hurts Blue — never helps Blue.

What if I **Ask** C something?

Say: Ask(C, bag)

C will answer — but C only knows “banana” — so he’ll say “banana”, whether truthfully or lying — but I already know the truth: it’s **ball**.

So I learn nothing useful — and I pay 0.5 points — Blue goes to -0.5 — again, worse.

Alternatively, I could ask about another container — but I already know everything:

- bag: ball
- box: empty
- basket: banana

I saw everything — I have perfect knowledge.

So asking anyone anything — I gain **no new information** — but pay 0.5.

Telling — only helps enemy or wastes points.

Pass —
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I know the basket contains the ball, because I was the one who put it there and I never saw anyone remove it.  
Since the upcoming question will be directed at me and will ask “What is in the basket?”, I can guarantee my team 1 point simply by answering correctly.  
No communication is necessary, and any Ask or Tell would cost 0.5 points without improving our chance to score.

Action: I know the basket contains an orange, because I was the one who put it there and I have not left the room since then.

Since the question will be directed at me and will ask about the basket, I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to learn or share anything; I already have the correct answer ready for the answer phase.

Action: I need to decide what to do on my turn. The question will be asked to **B**, and it’s about **what is in the bag**.

Let’s reconstruct the sequence of events carefully, from the perspective of **who knows what**.

---

### Initial state:
- All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
- Containers: bag, box, basket — all empty.

### Events:
1. **D puts a banana in the bag.**  
   → All players see this.  
   → Now: bag = banana, box = empty, basket = empty.

2. **D leaves the room.**  
   → All players see D leave.  
   → D is now outside, unaware of future events.

3. **B moves the banana from the bag to the box.**  
   → A, B, C are in the room → they all see this.  
   → Now: bag = empty, box = banana, basket = empty.

4. **B puts a brick in the bag.**  
   → A, B, C see this.  
   → Now: bag = brick, box = banana, basket = empty.

5. **B leaves the room.**  
   → A and C see B leave.  
   → B is now outside, unaware of future events.

6. **C moves the banana from the box to the basket.**  
   → A and C are in the room → they see this.  
   → Now: bag = brick, box = empty, basket = banana.

7. **C moves the brick from the bag to the box.**  
   → A and C see this.  
   → Now: bag = empty, box = brick, basket = banana.

8. **C moves the brick from the box to the bag.**  
   → A and C see this.  
   → Final state: bag = brick, box = empty, basket = banana.

---

### Final container states:
- **Bag**: brick  
- **Box**: empty  
- **Basket**: banana

---

### Who knows what?

Let’s track **B’s knowledge**.

- B was present for steps 1–5.
- After step 5, B **leaves** the room.
- So B **did not see** steps 6, 7, or 8.

So from B’s perspective:
- After step 5: bag = brick, box = banana, basket = empty.
- Then B leaves.
- B **does not know** that C moved the banana to the basket, or that the brick was moved from bag → box → bag.

So **B’s last known state** is:
- bag = brick
- box = banana
- basket = empty

But **in reality**, after C’s moves:
- bag = brick
- box = empty
- basket = banana

So **B thinks** the bag has a **brick** — and **B is correct** about the bag!

Even though B missed the later moves, **the brick ended up back in the bag**, so **B’s belief is accurate**.

So **B will answer “brick”** if asked what is in the bag — and **that is correct**.

Therefore, **if B is asked what is in the bag, B will likely say “brick”**, and **that will earn the Blue team 1 point**.

But **I am A**, and **I know the truth**. I also know that **B’s belief is correct**, even if B’s reasoning is incomplete.

So **B is going to get the question right**, **unless** someone misleads B **before** the answer phase.

But the **answer phase is coming next**, and **I am in the action phase** — **my turn** — **right before** the answer phase.

The question is: **“I am going to ask B what is in the bag.”**

So **after my action**, the answer phase begins, and **B will be asked**.

My goal: **maximize Blue team’s chance to get this point**.

Since **B already believes the bag contains a brick**, and **that is correct**, **B will answer correctly** — **unless** B has been misled **since** leaving the room.

But **no one has told B anything** — because **Tell and Ask actions are private**, and **no actions have occurred yet**.

So **B’s knowledge is unchanged** — and **correct**.

Therefore, **if nothing happens**, **B will answer “brick”**, and **Blue gets 1 point**.

So **my best move is to do nothing** — **Pass** — **because any Ask or Tell costs 0.5 points**, and **B already knows the correct answer**.

Even if I **Tell B** the bag has a brick, it costs 0.5 points — **and B already knows it** — so **no benefit**.

If I **Ask** someone, it costs 0.5 — **and I already know** the bag has a brick — **so no benefit**.

**Pass** is free — and **preserves the correct answer**.

But wait — **could B be uncertain**? No — B **saw** the brick being put in the bag, and **never saw it removed** — because **B left before C moved it**.

But **C moved the brick out and back in** — **but B didn’t see that**.

So **B thinks** the brick is **still** in the bag — and **by coincidence**, **it is**.

So **B’s answer will be correct** — **even though B’s justification is incomplete**.

Therefore, **B will score the point** — **unless** I **mess it up** by **telling B something wrong** — but that would be stupid.

Or **if I tell B the wrong
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to decide what to do on my turn. Let me first reconstruct the current state of the room from the scenario, keeping track of who saw what.

Initial state (all four of us in the room):
- bag: empty
- box: empty
- basket: empty

1. I (A) put an orange in the basket.
   - Everyone in the room sees this.

2. B leaves the room.
   - B is now outside and unaware of anything that happens inside.

3. C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.
   - A, C, D see this. B does not.

4. B enters the room.
   - B re-enters and now sees future events, but missed the move in step 3.

5. D moves the orange from the bag to the basket.
   - A, B, C, D all see this (everyone is now in the room).

6. D leaves the room.
   - D is now outside.

7. C leaves the room.
   - C is now outside.

8. B moves the orange from the basket to the box.
   - A and B see this (C and D are outside and do not see it).

9. I (A) put a ball in the basket.
   - A and B see this (C and D are outside and do not see it).

Current state (who is in the room):
- A (me) and B are in the room.
- C and D are outside.

Current container contents:
- bag: empty (orange was moved out in step 5, nothing put back)
- box: orange (B moved it there in step 8)
- basket: ball (I put it there in step 9)

Now, the question phase will ask B: “What is in the basket?”

B’s knowledge:
- B saw me put the orange in the basket (step 1).
- B did not see C move it to the bag (step 3) — B was outside.
- B re-entered and then saw D move the orange back to the basket (step 5).
- B then moved the orange from the basket to the box (step 8).
- B saw me put a ball in the basket (step 9).

So B knows:
- The orange is now in the box.
- The basket now contains a ball.

Therefore, when asked “What is in the basket?”, B will correctly say “a ball”, and Blue team will earn 1 point.

I want to help my team (Blue) score. Since B already knows the correct answer, there is no need for me to intervene. Any Ask or Tell would cost 0.5 points and could only risk misleading or confusing B, or waste points. Passing costs 0 and changes nothing.

Best action: Pass.

Action: Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

SCORE
Blue=0.0, Red=0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a stapler in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... B moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... D puts a brick in the box. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the basket. ... B moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. ... D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

Action: I need to figure out what is in the box at the end of the scenario.

Let me trace the sequence of events step by step:

1. **Initial state**:  
   - Bag: empty  
   - Box: empty  
   - Basket: empty  

2. **You (A) put a stapler in the box**  
   - Box: stapler  
   - Bag: empty  
   - Basket: empty  

3. **C leaves the room**  
   - C is now outside, unaware of future room events.

4. **B moves the stapler from the box to the bag**  
   - Box: empty  
   - Bag: stapler  
   - Basket: empty  

5. **D puts a brick in the box**  
   - Box: brick  
   - Bag: stapler  
   - Basket: empty  

6. **You (A) move the stapler from the bag to the basket**  
   - Box: brick  
   - Bag: empty  
   - Basket: stapler  

7. **B moves the stapler from the basket to the bag**  
   - Box: brick  
   - Bag: stapler  
   - Basket: empty  

8. **D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket**  
   - Box: brick  
   - Bag: empty  
   - Basket: stapler  

So, at the end, **the box contains a brick**.

Since I (A) was present for all these events, I know exactly what happened. The question is: *do I need to do anything in the action phase?*

The answer phase will ask **me** (A) what is in the box. Since I already know it's a brick, I can answer correctly without needing to ask or tell anyone.

Taking an Ask or Tell action costs 0.5 points, and I don’t need to gather or share information — I already have the correct answer.

So the optimal action is:

**Pass**

> **Action: Pass**
A answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I know the current contents of every container because I was in the room the whole time and saw every move.

- bag: empty  
- box: banana (C moved it there last)  
- basket: stapler (D moved it there)

B left before any of the later moves, so B has no idea what happened after stepping out.  
The question will be “What is in the box?” and B will have to guess; if B guesses wrong, Red gets the point.

I can guarantee B answers correctly by simply telling B the truth.  
Cost: 0.5 points, but it secures 1 point for Blue when B answers correctly, a net +0.5.

Tell(B, box, banana)
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a ball in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the ball from the box to the bag. ... C puts an apple in the box. ... C moves the ball from the bag to the basket. ... D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. ... C moves the ball from the bag to the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I need to figure out what is in the box so that I can help B answer correctly in the answer phase.

From the scenario:

- Initially: bag, box, basket are all empty.
- D puts a ball in the box → box now has ball.
- B leaves the room → B is now outside and unaware of what happens next.
- C moves the ball from the box to the bag → box is now empty, bag has ball.
- C puts an apple in the box → box now has apple.
- C moves the ball from the bag to the basket → bag is empty, basket has ball.
- D moves the ball from the basket to the bag → basket is empty, bag has ball.
- C moves the ball from the bag to the basket → bag is empty, basket has ball.

So at the end, the box contains an apple.

B is outside the room and does not know any of the events after leaving. So B does not know that the ball was moved out of the box or that an apple was put in. B only knows that D put a ball in the box, and then B left. So B likely still thinks the box has the ball.

But the question is: I am going to ask B what is in the box.

So in the answer phase, B will be asked, and if B answers correctly (apple), Blue team gets 1 point. But B currently believes the box has the ball — so B will likely answer "ball", which is wrong.

I need to inform B of the correct contents before the answer phase.

Best action: Tell B what is actually in the box.

Action: Tell(B, box, apple)

This costs 0.5 points, but if B then answers "apple" correctly, we gain 1 point — net +0.5 for Blue.

Alternatively, I could Ask someone, but I already know the box has the apple — I saw the whole sequence. No need to Ask.

So I should Tell B the truth.

Action: Tell(B, box, apple)
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to decide what to do in this action phase. The key is to maximize the chance that **C answers the question about the basket correctly**, since the question will be asked to **C**, and if C answers correctly, **Red team (C and D)** gets 1 point. My team (Blue: A and B) wants to prevent that — we want C to answer **incorrectly**, so Red doesn’t score.

But I can’t directly control what C says. However, I can try to **influence C’s belief** about what’s in the basket, or **gather information** to help my team later.

Let’s analyze the scenario step by step:

---

**Initial state:**
- All players (A, B, C, D) in room.
- Containers: bag, box, basket — all empty.
- B puts **stapler** in **basket**.

So now:
- basket: stapler
- bag: empty
- box: empty

**C leaves the room.**
- C is now **outside**, unaware of anything that happens inside.

**D leaves the room.**
- D is also outside. Now only A and B are in the room.

**You (A) move the stapler from basket to bag.**
- Now: bag has stapler, basket is empty.

**You put a banana in the basket.**
- Now: basket has banana, bag has stapler, box empty.

**B moves the stapler from bag to box.**
- Now: box has stapler, bag empty, basket has banana.

**You move the stapler from box to bag.**
- Now: bag has stapler, box empty, basket has banana.

**B moves the stapler from bag to box.**
- Final state:
  - box: stapler
  - bag: empty
  - basket: banana

---

Now, **C is outside the room** during **all** of these later events (after C left). So C **does not know**:
- That the stapler was moved from basket → bag → box → bag → box
- That a banana was put in the basket
- That the basket is no longer empty

In fact, **C last saw**:
- The stapler in the basket
- Then C left
- Then D left
- Then a bunch of stuff happened — but C saw none of it

So **C’s current belief** is likely: **basket has stapler**, because that’s the last thing C saw.

But **in reality**, the basket has a **banana**.

So when I am asked: *“I am going to ask C what is in the basket.”*

If C answers **“stapler”**, that’s **wrong** → Red team **does not** get a point → good for Blue.

If C answers **“banana”**, that’s **correct** → Red team **gets 1 point** → bad for Blue.

So **I want C to answer incorrectly** — i.e., say “stapler” — so that C is wrong.

But C might **not** say “stapler” — C might **guess**, or **be told**, or **ask someone**, or **be told by someone else**.

But right now, **it’s my turn** in the **action phase**, and I can:
- Ask someone (e.g., Ask B what’s in the basket) — costs 0.5
- Tell someone something (e.g., Tell C that the basket has a stapler) — costs 0.5
- Pass — costs 0

But **C is outside the room**, and **I cannot communicate with C directly** unless I use **Tell(Player, Container, Contents)** — but **Tell** is **private**, and **can be a lie**.

So I **can** Tell(C, basket, stapler) — even though it’s **false** — to **reinforce C’s false belief**.

But **would that help?**

Yes — **if C believes** the basket has the stapler, then when asked, C will say “stapler”, which is **wrong**, so **Red gets 0 points** — **good for Blue**.

But **C might not trust me** — but the rules don’t say anything about trust. **C will hear whatever I tell**, and **can choose to believe it or not** — but **I don’t know** what C will do.

But **my goal** is to **maximize the chance** that C answers **incorrectly**.

So **if I tell C that the basket has the stapler**, I am **reinforcing** C’s **existing false belief** — which makes it **more likely** that C will **answer “stapler”** — which is **wrong** — so **Red gets 0** — **good**.

Alternatively, I could **do nothing** — but that **doesn’t help** — C might still guess “stapler”, but **I can increase the chance** by **lying to C**.

But **it costs 0.5 points** to Tell.

Is it worth 0.5 points to **increase the chance** that **Red gets 0 instead of 1**?

Yes — because **if C answers correctly**, Red gets **+1** — a **1-point swing** in their favor.

If I **spend 0.5** to **prevent** that, I **save 1 point** — so **net benefit** of **0.5** — **worth it**.

Alternatively, I could **Ask B** what’s in the basket — but **I already know** — it’s **banana**. So **no need** — that would be **waste
C answers: stapler
Incorrect. The basket actually contains banana.

Action: I know the bag currently contains the apple I put in it, because I was in the room the whole time and no one touched the bag after that.

Since the question will be about the bag, the safest thing is to make sure my teammate B also knows the correct answer so we can both earn the point if either of us is asked.  
I will privately tell B the truth about the bag.

Action: I need to figure out what is currently in the bag, because the question will be asking me that.

Let me reconstruct the sequence step-by-step, tracking only the bag (since the question is about the bag):

- Start: bag empty  
- C leaves (irrelevant to bag)  
- I put a brick in the bag → bag: brick  
- C enters (irrelevant)  
- I leave  
- I enter  
- C moves the orange from the bag to the basket → this implies the bag must have contained an orange at that moment. But I had put a brick in earlier. Contradiction?  

Wait: the narrative says “C moves the orange from the bag to the basket.” That can only happen if the orange was already in the bag. But I never put an orange in; I put a brick in. And no one else has been described as putting anything in before this point. The only object mentioned as being placed is my brick.

Therefore, the only way an orange could be in the bag is if someone secretly placed it while I was outside. But the rules say: if an object is put into a container while a player is outside the room, that player is *not* told. However, any player who is inside at the time *is* aware.

Let’s list every event with who is present:

1. All inside. Bag empty.  
2. C leaves → now A,B,D inside.  
3. I (A) put brick in bag → bag: brick. (B and D witness)  
4. C enters → all inside.  
5. I leave → B,C,D inside.  
6. I enter → all inside.  
7. C moves orange from bag to basket → this implies at this moment the bag contains an orange. But I left the brick in there. So either the brick was removed earlier, or the orange was added while I was out.

But no one is described as removing the brick. And no one is described as adding an orange. The only way the orange could appear is if someone (B, C, or D) put it in while I was outside (step 5: I leave → I enter). During that interval, B,C,D were inside. One of them could have:

- removed the brick (not mentioned)  
- put in an orange (not mentioned)

But the rules say: “when a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room.” So if B, C, or D had removed the brick or added an orange, *they* would know, but *I* (having been outside) would *not* be told. The scenario description only tells me what I would perceive. Since I was outside during that interval, I am *not* told about any silent actions (put/remove) that occurred then.

Therefore, the narrative I receive skips any put/remove actions that happened while I was out. That means:

- After I put the brick in (step 3), the bag has brick.  
- While I’m out (step 5→6), someone could have:  
  – taken the brick out (silent to me)  
  – put an orange in (silent to me)  

Then at step 7, C (who is inside) moves “the orange” from bag to basket. That action is described to me because I am now inside. So at that moment, the bag *does* contain an orange — the brick is gone.

Similarly, immediately after, D moves “the orange” from basket back to bag — so bag again has orange.

Then later: B leaves and enters, I leave, D leaves — no further moves involving bag are mentioned.

So final state: bag contains orange.

But I never saw the orange being placed or the brick being removed — those happened while I was outside. Yet the narrative *does* tell me about C’s and D’s moves *after* I return, because those happen while I’m inside.

Thus, despite not having seen the orange’s arrival, I *do* know that:

- At the time C moved it, the orange was in the bag.  
- Then D put it back into the bag.  

And nothing thereafter changes the bag. So the bag now holds an orange.

I do *not* need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell — I can deduce it.

Therefore, I will simply Pass, saving the point.

Action: Pass
A answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: Tell(B, box, ball)

Reasoning  
- The question will be asked to B, so B is the only player who must know the correct contents of the box.  
- I (A) already put the ball in the box and saw C put an apple in the basket, so I know the box still holds the ball.  
- Giving B this information now costs only 0.5 Blue points and guarantees B can answer correctly, earning 1 Blue point (net +0.5).  
- No other single action gives a higher expected payoff this turn.
B answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an orange in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the orange from the box to the bag. ... B puts a stapler in the box. ... C moves the stapler from the box to the basket. ... B moves the orange from the bag to the box. ...

Action: I need to decide what to do on my turn. Let me first reconstruct the final state of the containers from the scenario, because the question will be asked to D about the box.

Step-by-step:

1. Start: bag, box, basket all empty.  
2. B puts orange in box → box: orange, bag & basket empty.  
3. D leaves (now D is outside, so D misses everything that happens next).  
4. C moves orange from box to bag → bag: orange, box: empty, basket: empty.  
5. B puts stapler in box → box: stapler, bag: orange, basket: empty.  
6. C moves stapler from box to basket → basket: stapler, box: empty, bag: orange.  
7. B moves orange from bag to box → box: orange, bag: empty, basket: stapler.  
8. B leaves.

Final state when the question is asked:
- box: orange  
- bag: empty  
- basket: stapler  

D is outside and has been since step 3, so D has no knowledge of any of the moves after that. D last knew:
- box: orange (after step 2)  
- then D left, and never saw the later moves.

Therefore, if D is honest, D would say “orange” (correct). But players may lie. However, the scoring rule is: if the target player (D) answers the question correctly, Red team gets 1 point. If D answers incorrectly, no points. So Blue wants D to be wrong; Red wants D to be right.

I am on Blue (A & B). I want Red to miss this question, so I want D to answer incorrectly. I can’t force D to lie, but I can try to mislead D privately.

My options:
- Ask: costs 0.5, but I already know the true state, so asking anyone won’t help me.  
- Tell: I can tell D something false about the box, hoping D believes it and repeats it when asked.  
- Pass: do nothing, let D rely on outdated info (D thinks box still has orange, which is actually correct!).  

If I do nothing, D will likely say “orange” and be correct → Red gets 1 point. That’s bad for Blue.

So I should try to make D answer wrong. I can tell D a lie: say the box contains something else, so when D is asked, D might repeat my lie.

Best lie: tell D the box contains the stapler (the other object). Then D might say “stapler” → wrong → Red gets 0, Blue avoids losing ground.

Cost: 0.5 points, but prevents Red from gaining 1, so net +0.5 swing.

Action: Tell(D, box, stapler)

Action: Tell(D, box, stapler)
D answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0

Action: Tell(D, basket, stapler)

Reasoning  
- The question will be “What is in the basket?” and D is the one who must answer.  
- D left the room before you moved the banana and before B put the stapler in, so D has no idea what is in the basket now.  
- By privately telling D the correct current content (“stapler”), you give your teammate B (who will hear D’s answer) the best chance to confirm it and earn the Blue team 1 point.  
- The 0.5-point cost is worth the likely 1-point gain.
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Action: I know the box’s contents because I was in the room the whole time and I myself put the brick in the box after the stapler had already been moved out of it.  
No one has touched the box since, so the brick is still inside.

Since I will be the one questioned, I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell anything.  
I simply Pass and will answer “brick” when asked.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think through what B knows and what the true state is.

**True final state (from my perspective):**
- Basket: stapler (C put it there after moving the ball)
- Bag: empty (I moved the ball out twice, last to box)
- Box: ball (my last move)

**What B knows:**
- B was present when D put the ball in the basket.
- B then left and never returned, so B did **not** see:
  - C move the ball from basket → bag
  - C put the stapler in the basket
  - Any of my subsequent ball shuffles between bag and box

Therefore, from B’s point of view, the last thing known is: “ball is in the basket.” B has no information about anything after that.

The question I’m about to be asked is: “What is in the basket?” and it will be put to B.  
If B answers based on what B knows, B will say “ball” – which is **wrong** (it’s actually the stapler).  
If B answers correctly, Blue gets +1; if wrong, Blue gets 0 and we’ve spent nothing.

I can’t let B answer wrong. I must update B’s knowledge.

Best way: **Tell B the truth** about the basket now, so B can answer correctly.

Action: Tell(B, basket, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts an apple in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the apple from the bag to the box. ... B enters the room. ... D moves the apple from the box to the bag. ... C leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE

Action: I need to figure out what B currently believes is in the bag, because the question will be asked to B and I want to maximize the chance B answers correctly (so Blue team gets 1 point).

Let’s trace what B saw:

- Initially: all containers empty.
- C puts apple in bag → B sees this.
- B leaves → B no longer sees anything.
- C moves apple from bag to box → B does NOT see this (B is outside).
- B re-enters → B does NOT see what happened while outside.
- D moves apple from box to bag → B sees this (B is now inside).
- C leaves → B sees this, but irrelevant to contents.

So B saw:
1. Apple put in bag.
2. Later, D moves apple from box to bag.

But B **did not see** C move the apple from bag to box while B was outside.

Therefore, B’s belief:
- B thinks the apple went: bag → (invisible move) → still in bag? No — B **saw** D move it from box to bag. So B knows it was in the box before D moved it.

But how did it get into the box? B didn’t see that. So B knows:
- Apple was in bag (saw it placed)
- Then B left.
- Then B saw D move apple **from box to bag** — so B infers it must have been moved to the box at some point, but doesn’t know when.

So B **does** know the apple is now in the bag — because B saw D put it there.

Therefore, **B already knows the bag contains the apple**.

So if I do nothing, B will likely answer correctly — Blue gets +1.

But if I Ask or Tell, it costs 0.5 points — and we don’t need to do anything to win this round — we just need B to answer correctly.

But wait — the question is: **I am going to ask B what is in the bag.**

So B will answer based on B’s knowledge.

B **does** know the apple is in the bag (because B saw D move it there). So B will answer "apple" — **if B remembers**.

But B **does** remember — B saw D move it from box to bag. So B knows the apple is in the bag.

So B will answer correctly **without any help**.

Therefore, I should **Pass** — no cost, no risk, and B already knows the answer.

**Action: Pass**
B answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to decide what to do on my turn, given the scenario and the upcoming question: **"I am going to ask B what is in the basket."**

Let’s break this down carefully.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the final state of the containers**

We start with:
- Bag: empty
- Box: empty
- Basket: empty

Sequence of events:

1. **You (A) put a stapler in the basket.**
   - Basket: stapler
   - Bag: empty
   - Box: empty

2. **B leaves the room.**
   - B is now outside, unaware of anything that happens inside.

3. **C moves the stapler from the basket to the box.**
   - Now: Box has stapler, Basket is empty
   - B is outside → B does **not** see this.

4. **B enters the room.**
   - B is now back inside. From B’s perspective, since B was outside during the move, B **does not know** the stapler was moved.
   - So when B re-enters, B **still thinks** the stapler is in the basket (because that’s where it was when B left).

5. **D moves the stapler from the box to the basket.**
   - Now: Basket has stapler, Box is empty
   - B is in the room → B **sees** this move.

6. **C leaves the room.**
   - C exits. B sees this.

7. **D leaves the room.**
   - D exits. B sees this.

8. **B moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.**
   - Now: Bag has stapler, Basket is empty
   - B does this → B **knows** the stapler is now in the bag.

9. **B puts a ball in the basket.**
   - Now: Basket has ball, Bag has stapler, Box is empty
   - B does this → B **knows** the basket now contains a ball.

---

### **Final state (as known to you, A):**
- **Bag**: stapler
- **Box**: empty
- **Basket**: ball

---

### **What does B know?**

Let’s reconstruct B’s knowledge:

- B was in the room at the start → saw you put stapler in basket → thinks: basket = stapler
- B leaves → misses C moving stapler to box
- B re-enters → still thinks stapler is in basket (because that’s where it was when B left, and B didn’t see the move)
- Then B **sees** D move stapler from box to basket → but B **thought** it was already in the basket!  
  → This is confusing. But B **sees** D move it **from box to basket**, so now B knows:
  - It was in the box (so C must have moved it while B was out)
  - Now it’s back in the basket
- Then B **personally moves** the stapler from basket to bag → so B **knows** stapler is now in bag
- Then B puts a **ball** in the basket → so B **knows** basket now has a ball

So **B knows exactly**:
- Bag: stapler
- Basket: ball
- Box: empty

Therefore, **B knows the basket contains a ball**.

---

### **The Question:**
> I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

Since B **knows** the basket has a **ball**, B will **answer correctly** → **Blue team gets 1 point**.

So **if nothing changes**, **we (Blue) will score 1 point** from this answer.

Our current score: Blue = 0.0, Red = 0.0  
After correct answer: Blue = 1.0

---

### **Should I take an action?**

My options:
- **Ask(Player, Container)** → costs 0.5, learn info
- **Tell(Player, Container, Contents)** → costs 0.5, give info
- **Pass** → costs 0, do nothing

But **I already know the truth**. And **B already knows the truth** about the basket.

So **telling B** the contents of the basket is **useless** — B already knows it’s a ball.

**Asking** someone about the basket? I already know it’s a ball. And B is about to be asked — I don’t need to ask anyone.

But here’s a **key point**: **I can lie in a Tell action**, and **other players can lie when asked**.

However, **I cannot affect what B will say** — the question is coming from the game host, not me. B will answer based on B’s knowledge.

But **could I influence B’s answer** by **telling B something false**?

Wait — **Tell actions are private**, and **I can lie**.

So I could **tell B** something wrong about the basket — but **B already knows** it has a ball, because **B just put the ball there**.

So if I say: **Tell(B, basket, stapler)** — B will know I’m lying, because B **just put the ball in the basket**.

That might **confuse B**, but **B has no reason to believe me** over their own memory.

Moreover, **B is not required to tell the truth to the host** — but **there’s no incentive to lie to the host**, because **correct answers give points**.

So **B will answer truthfully** to the host, because **B wants Blue to score**.

Therefore, **B will say “ball”**,
B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The basket actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

No one has touched the orange since, and no one else has entered or left, so the orange is still in the box.

Action: I need to figure out what is currently in the box so I can answer correctly in the answer phase.

Let me trace the sequence of events:

1. C puts a stapler in the box.  
   → Box: stapler

2. D leaves the room.  
   → D is now outside, unaware of further room events.

3. B moves the stapler from the box to the bag.  
   → Box: empty, Bag: stapler

4. C puts an orange in the box.  
   → Box: orange, Bag: stapler

5. I move the stapler from the bag to the basket.  
   → Bag: empty, Basket: stapler, Box: orange

6. B moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.  
   → Basket: empty, Bag: stapler, Box: orange

7. I move the stapler from the bag to the basket.  
   → Bag: empty, Basket: stapler, Box: orange

So, at the end, the **box contains an orange**.

I know this because I was in the room the whole time and saw every action. I don’t need to ask or tell anyone — I already know the answer.

Therefore, I should **Pass** to avoid costing my team 0.5 points.

**Pass**
A answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Action: I know the basket contains a brick, because I was in the room the whole time until I left, and I personally placed the brick there and never moved it.  
Since the upcoming question will be directed at me and asks specifically about the basket, I do not need to spend 0.5 points to Ask or Tell anything.

Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: Let’s trace the brick’s location step-by-step from A’s (your) point of view:

1. Start: bag, box, basket all empty.  
2. You (A) put the brick in the bag → bag: brick, box: empty, basket: empty.  
3. B leaves → you still see everything.  
4. C (still in room) moves brick from bag to box → bag: empty, box: brick.  
5. B re-enters → you see B come back in.  
6. C moves brick from box to bag → bag: brick, box: empty.  
7. C leaves → you see C go out.

So right now the brick is in the bag.

The upcoming question is: “I am going to ask B what is in the bag.”  
If B answers correctly, Blue gets +1.  
B, however, was absent during the two moves (steps 4 & 6) and therefore does not know where the brick currently is.  
If we do nothing, B will probably guess and might be wrong, costing us the point.

We can fix this for free (0.5 cost < 1 gain) by telling B the truth.

Action: Tell(B, bag, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

- B was out of the room when D moved the stapler from the box to the bag and when D later put the banana in the box.  
- Therefore B never saw either of those two events and currently believes the box still contains the stapler.  
- By telling B the truth (“banana”) for only –0.5 points, we give B the correct answer to the upcoming question, virtually guaranteeing that our Blue team scores +1 point.  
- Net expected gain: +0.5 points, putting us ahead of Red.
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

7. D moves the brick from the bag to the box  
   bag: empty  
   box: brick  

8. You (A) leave the room (now only C and D are inside)

Final state when the question will be asked  
- basket: ball  
- bag: empty  
- box: brick  

The question will be posed to D: “What is in the basket?”  
D is still inside the room, so D has seen every move after step 2.  
Therefore D already knows the basket contains a ball.  
If D answers correctly, Red gets +1 point.

Your possible actions cost 0.5 points.  
- Asking or telling cannot change D’s knowledge (D already knows).  
- Passing costs 0 and changes nothing.

Since any communication action would spend 0.5 Blue points for no gain, the optimal move is:

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I notice a contradiction in the scenario description:

- First it says “C puts an apple in the bag.”  
- Later it says “D moves the apple from the box to the bag.”

But the box was never described as containing the apple; in fact, the box was empty at the start.  
Since containers can hold at most one object, the apple cannot be moved from the box to the bag unless it was already in the box—yet we were never told it was placed there.

The only consistent interpretation is that the apple is now in the bag (where C originally put it) and the “move” statement is either a mistake or a lie by the narrator. Therefore the bag contains the apple.

I don’t need to spend 0.5 points to discover this; I can simply wait for the answer phase and truthfully say “apple.”

Pass
A answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Fireworks

Action: I need to figure out what B currently believes is in the bag, because the question will be asked to B and I want to maximize the chance B answers correctly (so Blue team gets 1 point).

Let me trace what happened from B’s perspective:

- Initially: bag, box, basket all empty.
- I (A) put a ball in the bag → B sees this.
- D leaves → B sees this.
- B moves the ball from the bag to the box → B knows the ball is now in the box, and the bag is empty.
- I put a banana in the bag → B is still in the room, so B sees this. Now B knows: bag has banana, box has ball, basket empty.
- B leaves the room → B no longer sees anything that happens after this.

After B leaves:
- I move the ball from the box to the basket → B does **not** see this.
- C moves the ball from the basket to the box → B does **not** see this.
- I move the ball from the box to the basket → B does **not** see this.

So, from B’s current knowledge:
- Bag: has banana (last thing B saw before leaving)
- Box: had ball when B left, but B doesn’t know about later moves
- Basket: was empty when B left

But the ball has been moved around **after** B left, so B’s knowledge of the box and basket is outdated.

However, the question is: **“What is in the bag?”**

B **does** know the bag has a banana, because B saw me put it in, and B hasn’t seen it removed (and it hasn’t been removed).

So B **should** answer “banana” correctly — **unless** B has been misled.

But I cannot control what others say — and I cannot see inside containers now either. I only know the history.

I **do** know:
- Banana was put in the bag while B was present.
- No one has removed the banana since.
- So the bag **still contains the banana**.

Therefore, B **should** answer correctly — **unless** B has forgotten or is confused.

But I cannot communicate with B now in a way that helps **without** costing points.

My options:
- Ask someone: costs 0.5, but I don’t need info — I **know** the bag has banana.
- Tell B: “Tell(B, bag, banana)” — but B **already believes** that. It might reinforce, but costs 0.5, and B might already know.
- Pass: costs 0, and B will likely answer correctly.

Since B **saw** the banana go into the bag, and **never saw it leave**, B **knows** the bag has the banana.

So B will almost certainly answer correctly.

Thus, **no action is needed** — I should **Pass** to avoid losing 0.5 points unnecessarily.

**Action: Pass**
B answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think through what B actually knows.

B was present for:
- the initial state (empty bag, box, basket)
- me putting the ball in the bag
- D leaving
- B moving the ball from bag → box
- me putting the banana in the bag
- B leaving

After B left, I moved the ball box → basket, C moved it basket → box, and I moved it box → basket again.  
So B never saw any of those last three moves.

Therefore, from B’s point of view:
- the bag contains the banana I put in just before B exited
- the box contains the ball (because B personally placed it there and never saw it moved again)
- the basket is empty (B never saw anything go in)

The upcoming question is “What is in the bag?”  
If B answers with the banana, Blue scores 1.  
I can make that happen by simply telling B the bag’s current contents (banana).  
Cost: 0.5 points, but we gain 1, for a net +0.5.

Tell(B, bag, banana)
B answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a stapler in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... B moves the stapler from the bag to the box. ... You put an orange in the bag. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

Action: I need to decide what to do on my turn. Let me analyze the situation:

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: contains orange (I put it there after B moved the stapler out)
- Box: contains stapler (B moved it from bag to box)
- Basket: empty

**Key insight:** The question will be asking B what is in the bag. B saw me put the stapler in the bag initially, but then B moved the stapler to the box while C and D were outside. B also saw me put the orange in the bag after that.

So B knows the bag currently contains an orange.

Since B already knows the correct answer (orange), and the question will be asking B about the bag contents, there's no need for me to intervene. If B answers correctly (which they will), our Blue team gets 1 point.

Any Ask or Tell action would cost us 0.5 points unnecessarily.

**My action:** Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to decide what to do on my turn. Let me first reconstruct the current state of the room from the scenario.

Initial state:
- Bag: empty
- Box: empty
- Basket: empty

Sequence of events:
1. I put a stapler in the bag → Bag: stapler, Box: empty, Basket: empty
2. D leaves the room
3. C leaves the room
4. B moves the stapler from the bag to the box → Bag: empty, Box: stapler, Basket: empty
5. I put an orange in the bag → Bag: orange, Box: stapler, Basket: empty
6. I move the stapler from the box to the basket → Bag: orange, Box: empty, Basket: stapler
7. B moves the stapler from the basket to the box → Bag: orange, Box: stapler, Basket: empty
8. I move the stapler from the box to the basket → Bag: orange, Box: empty, Basket: stapler
9. B moves the stapler from the basket to the box → Bag: orange, Box: stapler, Basket: empty

So, at the end:
- Bag: orange
- Box: stapler
- Basket: empty

The question will be: "What is in the bag?" asked to B.

B was present for all these actions, so B knows the bag currently contains an orange.

If B answers correctly, Blue team (my team) gets 1 point. If B answers incorrectly, no points.

But B knows the truth, so B will likely answer correctly — unless I interfere.

But I cannot change what B will say — the question is directed to B, and B will answer based on what B believes.

However, I can choose to **Tell** B something false, to try to make B doubt or change their answer — but that risks B still answering correctly (since B saw everything), and then I just cost us 0.5 points for nothing.

Alternatively, I could **Ask** B what is in the bag — but that costs 0.5 points, and I already know it's an orange. That would be wasteful.

Or I could **Pass** — do nothing, cost 0 points, and let B answer correctly, earning us 1 point.

Since B was in the room the whole time and saw every move, B knows the bag has an orange. There's no reason for B to get it wrong. Any attempt to mislead B would likely fail and just cost us points.

Best action: **Pass**, let B answer correctly, gain 1 point for Blue team.

**Pass**
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0
