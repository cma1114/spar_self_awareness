  "game_setup": "\nLet's play a game! In this game you will be playing with a teammate against a team of opposing players. For simplicity, the players are referred to as A, B, C, and D. A and B are teammates on the Blue team, and C and D are teammates on the Red team. You are player A. The game is made up of turns, and each turn consists of a scenario, an action phase, and an answer phase. Players need to figure out the right action to take in each action phase, so that their team scores more points than their opponent's team.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn each scenario, one or more of the players start inside a room. The room has two or more containers, and ten or more objects. Each scenario may include:\n- one or more players entering or leaving the room\n- one or more players putting objects into containers\n- one or more players removing objects from containers\nEach container can hold at most one object. Players cannot see inside containers, but when a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room. When a player is outside the room they are unaware of anything that happens in the room, but do know if anyone enters or leaves the room. If an object is put or moved into a container while a player is outside the room, it will not be described to that player, but players leaving or entering the room will be described to that player.\nEllipses (\"...\") indicate the passage of time. At the end of the scenario, I will reveal a question that I will ask in the answer phase.\n\nACTION PHASE\nIn the action phase, the player whose turn it is can take one action: Ask, Tell, or Pass.\nAn Ask action entails asking any player the contents of one container. The format for an Ask action is: Ask(Player, Container); this will result in the player you ask answering your question. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nA Tell action entails telling any player the contents of one container. The format for a Tell action is: Tell(Player, Container, Contents); this will result in the player you tell hearing the answer you give. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nThe format for a Pass action is simply \"Pass\". Nothing changes as a result of this action, and it costs 0 points.\nAsk and Tell actions are private between the two players involved; other players do not hear or see these actions or their results.\nPlayers do not have to tell the truth either in their Tell actions or in response to another player's Ask action. \nA team's points can go negative.\n\nANSWER PHASE\nIn the answer phase, I will ask a target player (not necessarily the player whose turn it is) to name the contents of one container. When a player answers my question correctly, their team gets 1 point. When a player answers my question incorrectly, their team loses 1 point. The first team to 4 points wins.\n",

So the correct answer with current knowledge is already deducible: **the bag contains the stapler**.\n\n### Optimal action reasoning:\n- You already know what\u2019s in the bag for certain.\n- Asking costs 0.5 points; telling costs 0.5 points.  \n- Passing costs 0 points, and since there\u2019s no uncertainty, passing is best to preserve points.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal move:** `Pass`",

C leaves \u2192 outside.  \n   \u21d2 Now only A and D are in the room.\n4. A puts ball in **basket**.\n5. A leaves \u2192 outside.\n   \u21d2 Only D remains inside.\n6. A re-enters \u2192 inside with D.\n7. D moves ball **basket \u2192 bag**.\n8. D moves ball **bag \u2192 basket**.\n   \u21d2 At this point, the **basket again contains the ball**.\n9. D leaves the room (A remains inside).\n10. D enters again.\n11. A leaves (so now D is inside, A is outside).\n12. B enters (so now D and B are inside).\n13. B leaves.\n\n**Final state before the question:**\nWe need to determine the contents of the **basket** as you (A) know them.\n\nLet\u2019s track who saw what:\n\n- At step 8, the ball was last moved *into the basket* by D, with A present.  \n- After that, the ball was **never moved** again, according to your view.  \n- You saw all of D\u2019s moves (step 7 and 8).  \n- After step 8, no one performed any container actions that were visible to you.  \n\nLater, you left (step 11). While you were outside, B and D were in the room \u2014 that\u2019s the only possible window for an unseen action. But you *weren\u2019t told* that any objects were moved; however, in this game, you\u2019re only told what you would see. If you are outside, you don\u2019t see what happens inside, but it could have happened.\n\nAt this point, the question you\u2019ll get is: **\"What is in the basket?\"**\n\nCurrently, you don't know whether D or B did anything while you were outside (they might have moved the ball).  \nHowever:\n  - D could have altered containers while you were outside.  \n  - But maybe D didn\u2019t.\n\n**Strategic reflection:**\n- If you Pass and answer \u201cball,\u201d you\u2019re certain *at the time you left* it had a ball, but cannot guarantee it\u2019s still true. But you also have no way to confirm otherwise unless you Ask D or B.\n- If you Ask(D, basket): you spend 0.5 points and D may lie (red team).\n- Ask(B, basket): B might have seen something (B and D were last together), and B is *your teammate*. So B can be trusted to tell the truth.\n- Therefore, **Ask(B, basket)** is the most logical move \u2014 B entered after you left and overlapped with D; B is your teammate, so B can reliably tell you what they witnessed.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal Move:**  \n**Ask(B, basket)**",

D leaves the room.**  \nNow, D cannot see the next events.\n\n**2. You (A) put a ball in the bag.**  \nNow, **bag = ball.**  \nEveryone currently *in* the room (A, B, C) saw that.  \n**D** does **not** know that the bag now has a ball (he was outside).\n\n---\n\n**3. D enters the room.**  \nNow all players A, B, C, D are in the room again.\n\n**4. You (A) leave the room.**  \nYou cannot see what happens next until you re-enter.\n\n---\n\n**5. You enter the room.**  \nSo far, since you left and returned without any action by others in between (per visible text), bag likely still holds the **ball**.\n\n---\n\n**6. B moves the banana from the bag to the basket.**  \nWait \u2014 this line says \u201cmoves the banana from the bag to the basket.\u201d  \nBut earlier, **you** had put a **ball** in the bag, not a banana.  \nThis could be an intentional confusion or that there was a *banana* there unknown to us from outside view \u2013 but the scenario says at the start the containers are empty, and only you put any object in (ball). So the \"banana\" action means **B** is changing what\u2019s in the bag (almost certainly incorrectly describing it, or just the text is meant to be ambiguous).\n\nHowever, since you are **in the room** at this point, you directly observe B's action exactly as described: \u201cB moves the banana from the bag to the basket.\u201d  \nSo regardless of the naming confusion, the important fact is the **bag becomes empty** and the **basket now contains the same object** that was in the bag (whether ball or banana\u2014it\u2019s that same item).\n\nSo after step 6:  \n- bag = empty  \n- basket = (the same object from the bag, i.e., ball/banana)  \n\n---\n\n**7. C moves the banana from the basket to the bag.**  \nAll players (A, B, C, D) are still in the room, so you see this too.  \nNow the bag = that object again, basket = empty.\n\n---\n\n**8. D leaves the room.**  \nD cannot see what happens next.\n\n**9. D enters the room.**\n\n**10. You leave the room.**  \nYou are now out, so you can\u2019t see events after this until re-entry (but you never re-enter before the question).\n\n**11. C leaves the room.**  \n\nFinal state at question time (from your perspective):\n\nYou (A) are **outside**, unable to see the final few events (but you saw up through step 9).  \nHowever, between your leaving (step 10) and question time:\n- The only event after your departure is C leaving the room (step 11).  \n- No mention of any object movement occurred after you left.  \n\nSo the bag\u2019s contents have not changed since step 7.\n\n---\n\n### Therefore, from your informed perspective:\nAt the end, **bag contains the same object that C moved into it**, which is the **banana** (the description used by the scenario).\n\nSo, **you know the true contents: bag = banana**.\n\n---\n\n### Choosing the best action\n\nIt\u2019s currently your team\u2019s turn (Blue: A and B).  \nIf you pass now:\n- No immediate cost.\n- You already have perfect knowledge of the correct answer.  \n- The question will then immediately be asked to *you*, and you can answer correctly to earn +1 point later.\n\nIf you use Ask or Tell, that costs 0.5 points, which is unnecessary since you already know the answer with certainty.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:** `Pass`",

After leaving, B didn\u2019t witness anything else.

Everyone in the room saw that (B, C, D all saw that).  \n- Then you left the room.  \n- Then B left the room (so after that both A and B are outside).  \n- Then D left the room (so now nobody in the room? Wait: that would leave only C inside). So at that point, **C is still in the room**, since only A, B, D have left.  \n- Then D enters the room again (so now C and D are inside).  \n- Then B enters the room (so now B, C, D are inside).  \n- Then B leaves the room again (so now C and D stay inside; A and B are outside).  \n\nAt the end, the question is: *\"I am going to ask B what is in the box.\"*  \n\n### Who currently knows the correct contents\n- You know it\u2019s a stapler.  \n- Since you left early, you didn\u2019t see what happened later.  \n- Possible that C or D changed what\u2019s in the box when B wasn\u2019t in the room.  \n\nWe don\u2019t know if the stapler is still in there \u2014 something could have changed it while you were out.  \nHowever, you also don\u2019t know any subsequent activity by C or D because you were outside for all of it.  \n\n### Possible strategies\n- You could **Ask** someone (likely B) about the current box contents.  \n- You could **Tell** B the box contains the stapler (which might be true or false).  \n- Or you could **Pass** and let B rely on their own knowledge.\n\n### Evaluating options\n- **Ask(B, Box)** costs 0.5 points, but it would tell you what B currently believes. That could help you adapt later turns, but this immediate question is being asked *now*, and your action occurs before B answers the game master\u2019s question. You asking won't change B\u2019s knowledge.  \n- **Tell(B, Box, Stapler)** would give B information (perhaps helpful if you think the stapler is still correct). It costs 0.5 points, but it might help guarantee a correct answer (worth +1 net 0.5).  \n- **Pass** costs nothing, but risks B answering wrong if the box\u2019s contents changed.  \n\nHowever, key insight: You *don\u2019t know* if anything changed. B was in and out of the room; D and C moved around. B might have seen inside when A was gone (no\u2014he wasn\u2019t in when you left, so only C and D were in for some time). Since container actions could have happened when B was out, B\u2019s knowledge may be outdated. A tell might *mislead* if the situation changed.\n\n### Optimal play under uncertainty\nSince you have no direct knowledge of changes after you left, you cannot guarantee the stapler is still there. Anything you tell B could be wrong, potentially causing your team to lose 1 point and spend 0.5 more.\n\nTherefore, the most rational action is **Pass**, since any tell would be pure guess and may backfire.\n\n\u2705 **Final Answer:**  \n**Pass**",

C puts a *stapler* in the **box**.  \n\u2192 All in room (A, B, C, D) see this.\n\n**Then B leaves the room.**  \nNow inside: A, C, D.  \nB is *outside* \u2192 B will not see any further changes inside.\n\n**Then:**  \n2. D moves the *stapler* from the **box** to the **bag**.  \nInside: A, C, D see this.  \nBag = stapler, Box = empty.\n\n3. C puts a *ball* in the **box**.  \nInside: A, C, D see this.  \nFinal inside knowledge (for now): bag = stapler; box = ball.\n\n**Then D leaves the room.**  \nFinal state according to A (you):  \n- Bag = stapler  \n- Box = ball  \n- Basket = empty  \nA and C are in the room; D and B are outside.\n\n### What each knows:\n- **A (you)** saw all actions; state known: box = ball.  \n- **B** left *before* any further moves. So B still thinks box = stapler.  \n- **C** same as A (saw all).  \n- **D** left *after* C put the ball in box, so D also saw the final state correctly: ball in box.  \n\nWait\u2014but the scenario says:\n> \u201c\u2026 D leaves the room. \u2026 I am going to ask D what is in the box.\u201d\n\nSo D *did* see C put the ball in the box before D left. That means D should *know* the correct answer: \u201cball.\u201d\n\n### Therefore,\nif nothing changes, D will correctly answer \u201cball.\u201d That gives a **Red team point** (+1 Red).\n\nWe must decide if there\u2019s an action that can reduce Red\u2019s chance of scoring or reduce our cost.\n\nWe can:\n- **Ask** someone something (cost 0.5), or  \n- **Tell** someone something (cost 0.5), or  \n- **Pass** (0).  \n\nBut your action happens **before** the answer phase starts \u2014 **and all players know** that actions are private.  \nHowever, the only relevant player who can change their answer if deceived is D (since they will be asked).  \nD is on the **Red team** \u2014 we want them to be *wrong*! That means if we can cause D to believe something false, we might make D answer incorrectly.\n\n### Could we deceive D?\nYes. We could use a **Tell(D, Box, \u2026)** action to try to mislead D.\n\nIf we **Tell(D, Box, Stapler)**, it might make D believe the stapler is in the box.  \nThen when D is asked \"what is in the box,\" they might answer \u201cstapler,\u201d which is incorrect.  \nThat would lose Red 1 point.  \nOur cost: 0.5 points for the Tell action (so Blue = -0.5, Red = -1).  \nNet +0.5 advantage for Blue relative to Red \u2014 that\u2019s good.\n\nIf we instead **do nothing (Pass)**, D answers correctly \u2192 Red +1, Blue 0.  \nThat\u2019s a 1-point swing in favor of Red, worse for us.\n\nSo, best move for Blue team:\n\ud83d\udc49 **Tell(D, Box, Stapler)** \u2014 misleading D.\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n**Action:** `Tell(D, Box, Stapler)`",

So C also knows final truth (box = ball).\n- **D** left after event 5, before A and C made several moves.  \n   - D\u2019s last knowledge when leaving:  \n     - bag = stapler (since D just moved it there)  \n     - box = ball (since C put a ball in box afterwards, D saw this before leaving). So D *believes* box = ball when leaving.  \n   - Actually, D DOES know that box = ball at that point. After D left, new moves happened with the stapler, but they all involved bag and basket, not the box.

Expected net +0.5 advantage if C believes us and errs.  \n- Ask someone (like D or B) for container info: doesn't change C\u2019s mind, doesn\u2019t influence score this round. Wastes 0.5 points.  \n- Pass gives no cost but no info change; likely C will answer \u201cbrick,\u201d which is wrong (basket has apple), yielding Blue +1 point\u2014but we need to make sure C doesn\u2019t somehow get correct info elsewhere.\n\nSo:  \nIf we **do nothing (Pass)**, C answers \"brick\" \u2192 wrong \u2192 Blue +1, Red \u22121.

C puts **stapler** in basket \u2192 basket: stapler  \n2. B leaves the room \u2192 B outside.  \n3. D moves **stapler** from basket \u2192 bag \u2192 basket empty, bag: stapler.  \n4. C puts **orange** in basket \u2192 basket: orange, bag: stapler.  \n5. D moves **stapler** from bag \u2192 box \u2192 bag empty, box: stapler, basket: orange.  \n6. You (A) move **stapler** from box \u2192 bag \u2192 box empty, bag: stapler, basket: orange.  \n7. C moves **stapler** from bag \u2192 box \u2192 bag empty, box: stapler, basket: orange.  \n8. You leave room.  \n\nSo final situation:  \n- **Box:** stapler  \n- **Basket:** orange  \n- **Bag:** empty  \n\n### Step 2: Who knows what\n- **B** left early (after C\u2019s first action), so B saw stapler placed in basket. B missed everything else.\n    \u2192 B thinks stapler still in basket.  \n\n- **D** was there the whole time except when you left. D saw *everything* that happened.  \n    So D knows basket: orange.  \n\n- **C** saw all actions except after you left (no one left/entered after you left). C last action was moving stapler to box, so C knows true situation.  \n\n- **You (A)** were there for everything until you left at the very end. You know the same as C.  \n\n### Step 3: The question target\nYou are told **\u201cI am going to ask D what is in the basket.\u201d**\n\n### Step 4: Strategic analysis\nD *already* knows what\u2019s in the basket (orange).  \nSo D will answer \u201corange\u201d correctly, earning **+1 point for Red** unless you do something to confuse/mislead D.\n\n### Step 5: Possible actions\nYou can take one action: Ask, Tell, or Pass.\n\nAsk costs 0.5 points, Tell costs 0.5 points, Pass costs 0.  \n- You can\u2019t confuse D directly with an Ask (because an Ask tells *you* something, not D).  \n- A Tell could mislead D \u2014 for example, you could Tell(D, basket, stapler).  \n\nYou would spend 0.5 points for the chance to make D answer incorrectly (giving Red \u20131 point), which nets Blue +0.5 overall if D is fooled, +1.5 swing in total score difference.\n\n### Step 6: What would be effective?\nD already knows the truth; to successfully mislead, you\u2019d need to convince D that *you* know something D doesn\u2019t. D might doubt you since they saw it all.  \nHowever, gameplay implies D only has your message privately and must decide whether to believe you.  \nThere\u2019s no cost-free better option.\n\nExpected value:\n- If D believes you \u2192 Blue effectively +1.5 (since Red gets \u20131, we lose 0.5 cost).\n- If D doesn\u2019t believe you \u2192 Blue \u20130.5 (just the cost).  \nGiven the potential upside, the Tell is worthwhile since Pass gives no chance of gain.\n\n### \u2705 Optimal Action:\n**Tell(D, basket, stapler)**\n\nHope D believes it and answers incorrectly.",

The Red team\u2019s D will be asked, so if D answers correctly Red gets a point; if D answers incorrectly they lose a point.\n\nIt would be in *Blue\u2019s* interest to mislead D if possible \u2014 but any Ask or Tell we do is private between players (so only between A and another player we choose). D will not hear anything unless we TELL D something. We could tell D a false container content to try to trick them into answering incorrectly.  \n\nSo the strategic choice is whether to risk 0.5 points to try to make D answer incorrectly.  \n\nIf we **Tell(D, Basket, Stapler)** (a false statement), D might believe that and say \u201cstapler,\u201d scoring -1 for Red \u2192 net swing +1 for us even though costs us 0.5.

      "action": "Let's reason carefully:  \n\nWe\u2019re told that ultimately you will ask **D** what is in the **basket**. We want D (on the **Red** team) to get it *wrong*, so Blue should not help them.  \n\nWe\u2019re player **A**, on the **Blue** team. Our teammate is **B**. Since we pay \u20130.5 points for any Ask or Tell, and there\u2019s no benefit to helping Red, we should either (1) ensure we and B know the truth for future turns or (2) avoid giving away information.\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct what happens in the scenario:\n\n1. **Start:** Room clear; bag, box, basket all empty.  \n   All (A,B,C,D) in room \u2192 everyone sees all actions so far.  \n\n2. C puts **brick in basket**. (A,B,C,D) see this.  \n   Basket: brick.\n\n3. \u2026 **D leaves the room.** Now D will *not* see anything until re-enters.\n\n4. C moves **brick from basket to bag.**  \n   A,B,C see this; D does not.  \n   Basket empty, Bag: brick.\n\n5. \u2026 **D enters the room.** Now D sees current visible state (basket empty, bag has brick).  \n\n6. \u2026 **C moves brick from bag to basket.**  \n   Everyone in room: A,B,C,D see this.  \n   Basket: brick.\n\n7. \u2026 **B leaves the room.** B won\u2019t see later moves.\n\n8. \u2026 **D moves brick from basket to box.**  \n   A,C,D see; B doesn\u2019t.  \n   Now Basket empty, Box: brick.\n\n9. \u2026 **C puts orange in basket.**  \n   A,C,D see this.  \n   Basket: orange; Box: brick.  \n\n10. \u2026 **A leaves the room.**  \n    While outside, A cannot see anything further.\n\n11. \u2026 **B enters the room.** A (outside) knows B entered but not what B does.\n\n12. \u2026 **B leaves the room.** A (outside) knows B left, not what happened inside; no other actions described\u2014so nothing additional occurred that we\u2019re told, which implies nothing changed visibly.\n\nThus, **final actual contents**:\n- Basket: orange\n- Box: brick\n- Bag: empty  \n\nNow, what does **D know**?\n\nLet\u2019s summarize D\u2019s knowledge:\n- D was inside initially (basket: brick).  \n- D left before C moved brick to bag.  \n- So D missed that action\u2014D does not know that brick ever went to bag.  \n- D reenters when the basket is empty, bag has brick; D might *infer* that brick is in bag (since he saw brick in basket last he knew, and sees now brick gone, bag closed?), but he might not be told contents explicitly\u2014let\u2019s assume he understands that when reentered, the state was bag had brick, basket empty (since he can observe anything that's in plain view).  \n- Then C moves brick from bag to basket \u2014 D sees this. Now D knows brick in basket.  \n- Then B leaves. D still there.  \n- D then moves brick from basket to box \u2014 D knows brick now in box, basket empty.  \n- Then C puts orange in basket \u2014 D sees this.  \nThus D knows final state *basket: orange*, box: brick.  \n\nSo if D is asked \u201cwhat is in the basket,\u201d D will answer \u201corange,\u201d which is indeed correct.\n\nTo make Red lose, we would want D to get it wrong. We can *try* to mislead D (Tell) incorrectly\u2014but Telling costs 0.5 points, and it can make Red answer wrong (good). However, D is on the Red team, so tricking them into an incorrect answer is beneficial to Blue.\n\nThus we could do something like **Tell(D, Basket, Brick)** (a lie) to get D to possibly answer wrong.\n\nHowever, we must consider that a Tell costs \u20130.5 points; if D actually believes us and gets it wrong, Blue gets +1 for them being wrong (since Red loses 1). Net benefit = +1 \u2013 0.5 = +0.5, assuming D believes us.\n\nIf D does not believe us and answers correctly, Blue wastes \u20130.5 point.\n\nDo we know D\u2019s reasoning? D was in the room almost the entire time except when C moved the brick from basket\u2192bag. Given how experienced D seems (they saw all changes except one), D may trust their own observation rather than a last minute tell. But since the rules say we *can* perform Tell and it costs only 0.5, it might still be worth the gamble if D might be misled at all.\n\nHowever, typically the other team won\u2019t trust an opposing team\u2019s Tell since teams can lie. Given the rational nature of the game, D knows we are Blue and wants Red to win; thus D won\u2019t trust our statement, making the Tell worthless (only costs points to us).\n\nSo the *optimal action* is: **Pass**.\n\n\u2705 **Reasoning:**  \n- D already knows the true contents.  \n- Any telling or asking costs us points with no real benefit; we can\u2019t make D forget what he saw.  \n- Passing costs 0 and avoids giving away info or losing points.\n\n**Final action:**  \n> Pass",

The scenario cuts off with \u201c\u2026\u201d.  \n- Now you (A) are outside, unaware if anything changed afterward, though it\u2019s likely something might have happened after you left (since there was ellipsis).  \n\n**At the end:** The question will be: \u201cI am going to ask **C** what is in the box.\u201d  \nSo C will be asked in the answer phase.\n\n**Your goal:** Help Blue team (you + B) maximize score.\n\nSince you don\u2019t know if anyone changed what\u2019s in the box after you left, you now have incomplete information. But it\u2019s *C* (on the Red team) who will be asked. Since C originally put the brick in the box and knows what they themselves did, they probably still know what\u2019s in the box\u2014unless something changed after you left.\n\nAs A, you can:\n- Ask someone (B, C, or D) about the contents of a container (cost 0.5)\n- Tell someone a content (cost 0.5)\n- Pass (cost 0)\n\nIf you ask, you get information\u2014but it doesn\u2019t help directly because *you* won\u2019t be the one answering. Unless you can sabotage (by misleading), it doesn\u2019t help to spend points unnecessarily.  \nSince C (opponent) is the one being asked, we actually **want C to be wrong.**  \n\nSo, you might try to *Tell C* incorrect information about the box\u2019s content \u2014 to confuse them, making them more likely to answer incorrectly, thus giving Blue +1.  \n\nBut this costs 0.5 points. If we can mislead C and make them answer wrong, net = +0.5 (since they lose 1, we lose 0.5).  \n\nIf you do nothing, C might answer correct, resulting in Red +1. That\u2019s bad.\n\nSo it\u2019s worthwhile (despite the small cost) to **mislead C**.\n\n**Best action:**  \nTell(C, box, bag) or Tell(C, box, \"bag\") doesn\u2019t make sense\u2014the \"contents\" should be an object, not another container. The actual container contents originally was \u201cbrick\u201d. So, to mislead, say something false like \u201cthe box contains the basket\u201d (nonsensical) or \u201cthe box contains the ball\u201d (if there was one), but since the only mentioned items are brick, bag, box, basket, I can say something plausible but false: e.g. \u201cthe box contains the basket\u201d (impossible physically) or \u201cthe box is empty.\u201d\n\nSimplest misleading but plausible claim:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Tell(C, box, empty)**  \n\nThat will make C think someone must have removed the brick, reducing their certainty.\n\n**Final action:**  \n**Tell(C, box, empty)**",

What you know\nSince you saw both of these events:\n- First C put a **ball** in the bag,\n- Then later, while you were watching, C put a **banana** in the same bag.\n\nEach container can hold **at most one object**, so when C puts the banana in the bag, the banana **replaces** the ball.\n\nTherefore, at the end:\n- The bag contains a **banana**.  \n- You know this for sure.\n\n### Step 3. Choosing your action\nIn the answer phase, you are the one who will be asked what is in the bag, and you already know the correct answer.  \nIf you perform an Ask or Tell, it costs your team 0.5 points.

Now inside: A, C.\n\n3. **C puts a ball in the bag.**  \n   \u2192 You witness this. So **bag = ball**.  \n\n4. **B enters.**  \n   \u2192 You see B enter. Inside now: A, B, C.\n\n5. **D enters.**  \n   \u2192 You see D enter. All four now in the room.\n\n6. **You leave.**  \n   \u2192 Now you (A) are outside. You won\u2019t see what happens next until you re-enter.\n\n7. **B leaves.**  \n   \u2192 You (outside) can tell B left (entrance/exit events are visible).\n\n8. **D leaves.**  \n   \u2192 You see that D left.\n\n   (So B and D are outside; unclear whether C is inside or not\u2014but no statement says C left, so C is inside.)\n\n9. **You enter the room.**  \n   \u2192 You\u2019re now inside again. Astute note: from Event 3, bag had the ball; none of the events you missed explicitly changed it **unless C acted while you were outside**. Let's read on.\n\n10. **C moves the brick from the bag to the basket.**  \n   \u2192 Hmm! You see this while inside. But wait \u2014 this must mean the bag contained a *brick*!  \n   But you *thought* earlier the bag contained a *ball.* That implies either:\n   - The \"ball\" was replaced by a \"brick\" earlier while you were outside (unknown to you but we observed it now).\n   In any case, *you now witness C moving the brick from bag \u2192 basket*.  \n   \u2192 **After this step: bag = empty, basket = brick.**\n\n11. **C moves the brick from the basket to the bag.**  \n   \u2192 **After this step: bag = brick, basket = empty.**\n\n12. **C leaves the room.**  \n   \u2192 Now inside: A only.\n\n13. **C enters the room.**  \n   \u2192 Now inside: A, C.\n\n14. **You leave the room.**  \n   \u2192 Now outside again.\n\n15. **B enters the room.**  \n   \u2192 You can see that B entered.\n\n16. **B leaves the room.**  \n   \u2192 You see B leave.\n\n---\n\n### Just before the question\nWhen the scenario ends, **you (A)** are **outside** the room.  \nThe *last known contents you personally saw* (Event 11) are:  \n\u2192 **bag = brick**, **basket = empty**, **box = empty.**\n\nAfter Event 11, the only players who came or left:\n- C left and re-entered while you were inside (no actions described while you observed them re-enter / no objects moved in text while you were outside after that),  \n- then you left, and while you were outside, B entered/left \u2013 but no description of moving objects occurred.  \n\nTherefore: no information suggests anything changed after you last saw it. So **in reality**, the bag still contains the **brick**.\n\n---\n\n### What you know vs. what others know\n- B and D were outside when the key object movements occurred (the brick moves).  \n- C definitely knows where the brick is (since they did all the object moves last).  \n- You know too, since you saw the brick moves happen.  \n- B probably doesn\u2019t know (B was not inside for those moves at events 10\u201311).\n\n---\n\n### The question:\n> \"I am going to ask you what is in the bag.\"\n\n---\n\n### As Player A \u2014 deciding your Action\nYou already **know** the correct answer (the bag contains the brick).  \nThere\u2019s no new information to gain.  \nEach Ask/Tell would cost 0.5 points.

So B might be lying in the narrative description. But the scenario tells you this *as a true event*. That means there must be a **ball** in the basket at that time \u2014 so perhaps the orange was replaced by a ball somehow while you were away. That could have happened while you were outside (events you didn\u2019t see).  \n   After this action, **bag = ball**, **basket = empty**.  \n8. **C moves the ball from the bag to the basket.**  \n   Now **basket = ball, bag = empty**.  \n9. **You leave** \u2192 you are now outside, so unaware of subsequent changes.  \n10. **C leaves** \u2192 now only B and D remain inside.\n\nAt the end, you (A) are outside. The question will be: *\u201cWhat is in the basket?\u201d*  \n\nFrom your standpoint:\n- You did see C move the ball into the basket, but then you *left*.  \n- After you left, you know C also left, but B and D stayed. Either of them **could** have changed the contents of the basket; you don\u2019t know.  \nSo you have **uncertainty** between what\u2019s visible to B and D, but not you.\n\n---\n\n### What can you do?\nYou can **Ask** or **Tell** or **Pass**.  \n\nYou will be asked \"what is in the basket.\"  \nYou get +1 if you answer correctly, -1 if wrong.  \nAsking costs 0.5 points, telling also 0.5.  \n\nThe people who currently know what\u2019s actually there are the ones who were *in the room last*: B and D.  \n\nYou might want to **Ask** one of them, probably your teammate **B**, since B is on your team and might answer truthfully.  \n\nIf you **Ask(B, basket)**, you will get B's answer at a cost of 0.5 points. That\u2019s likely worthwhile, because otherwise you\u2019re guessing in uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:**  \n**Ask(B, basket)**",

The only thing you directly saw was:\n- Ball placed in box (by B)  \n- Then you left.  \n\nYou didn\u2019t see any later moves. If asked right now, *you wouldn\u2019t be safe guessing* \u2014 unless you learn from someone who was inside.\n\n### Who knows the truth?\n- **B** saw every move (never leaves the room), and knows the final state correctly (ball is in the box).\n- **D** also saw everything, but is on the **Red team**, so will likely lie.\n- **C** was only in the room at the start (not stated that C leaves or acts, so they might have been present the whole time). Wait\u2014scenario says *\u201cYou, B, C, and D are in a room.\u201d* No one except you left or entered, so C also stayed in the room the entire time, thus **C and D know the truth**, and they\u2019re opponents.\n\nSo:\n- B (your teammate) \u2192 knows truth, **trustworthy**\n- C, D (opponents) \u2192 know truth, **likely untrustworthy**\n\nSince asking costs 0.5 and we don\u2019t get any guaranteed benefit unless we need information before answering \u2014 and I (A) am the one being asked \u2014 my goal is to answer correctly.\n\nB is reliable.

Everyone starts in room.  \n   Containers: **bag, box, basket** (all empty).  \n2. D puts banana in **basket**.  \n   \u2192 Everyone in room (A,B,C,D) sees the banana is in basket.  \n3. D **leaves** the room.  \n   \u2192 D no longer sees anything that happens afterward.  \n4. B moves banana **basket \u2192 bag**.  \n   \u2192 A, B, C see this. D does **not**.  \n5. C moves banana **bag \u2192 basket**.  \n   \u2192 A,B,C see this. D does **not**.  \n6. B **leaves** the room.  \n   \u2192 Now A and C are inside; B and D are outside.  \n7. C moves banana **basket \u2192 box**.  \n   \u2192 A and C see this.  \n8. C puts **orange in basket**.  \n   \u2192 A and C see this.  \nEnd state (true state):  \n- **Box:** banana  \n- **Basket:** orange  \n- **Bag:** empty  \n\n**What different players believe (based on their knowledge):**\n- **C** knows everything that happened \u2192 knows basket has orange.  \n- **A (you)** also saw everything \u2192 knows basket has orange.  \n- **B** left after C first moved banana basket\u2190bag but before C moved it to box. So B\u2019s last view: step 5, banana is in basket (no orange). So B *believes* basket has banana.  \n- **D** left long before any further moves \u2014 at that time banana was in basket. So D *also* believes basket has banana.\n\n**Question:** \"I am going to ask D what is in the basket.\"  \nD believes banana is in the basket \u2192 D will say **banana** unless we change his belief.\n\nWe want the Blue team (A+B) to score more than Red team (C+D).  \nIf D answers incorrectly, Red \u22121. If D somehow answers correctly, Red +1.\n\nCurrently, D\u2019s belief (banana) is **wrong** (actual: orange). So if D answers honestly, Red will lose 1 point \u2014 great for us. So we should **not** give D any information that would correct his answer.\n\n**Action decision:**\nChoosing Ask or Tell costs 0.5 points, Pass costs 0.  \nAny Ask/Tell involving D could only help him.  \nAsking B, C, or D costs 0.5 and gains us nothing right now because we already know the true situation and don\u2019t need more info this turn.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:** **Pass**\n\n**Answer:**  \nPass",

Initially: bag (empty), box (empty), basket (empty)  \n2. D puts **apple** in **box** \u2192 box: apple  \n3. B leaves the room  \n4. D moves apple from **box \u2192 bag** \u2192 bag: apple; box: empty  \n5. D puts **ball** in **box** \u2192 bag: apple; box: ball  \n6. D moves apple from **bag \u2192 basket** \u2192 bag: empty; basket: apple; box: ball  \n7. You (A) move apple from **basket \u2192 bag** \u2192 bag: apple; basket: empty; box: ball  \n8. D moves apple from **bag \u2192 basket** \u2192 bag: empty; basket: apple; box: ball  \n9. You (A) leave the room  \n\nAt the end, right before you leave:\n- D is still in the room (maybe C too \u2014 yes, C and D are still there, B and A have left).  \n- The final state that you know when you left is: **box = ball**, **basket = apple**, **bag = empty**.\n\n### What happens next\nYou are told that the question will be:  \n> \u201cI am going to ask C what is in the box.\u201d\n\nSince you left, you don\u2019t know if anything else happened after you left \u2014 but based on the scenario description ending with \"You leave the room ...\" that\u2019s the end of the scene. So no further changes occur after you leave.  \n\nTherefore, the true content of the **box** is the **ball**.\n\n### Who currently knows what:\n- **You (A)** definitely know the correct content of the box (ball).  \n- **B** left before D made most of the changes; B only saw the apple go into box then left, so B believes box still holds apple (wrong).  \n- **C** never left the room, so C should know exactly what happened and the current state (box = ball).  \n- **D** obviously knows since D did the moves.  \n\n### The question to be asked:\nC will be asked what is in the box.  \nC will answer truthfully or not\u2014depending on C\u2019s motives (C is on the Red team, so C will likely answer correctly if that helps Red or perhaps incorrectly by accident, we can\u2019t control C).  \n\nBut our *action* can influence what information might be shared or what confusion might result. Let\u2019s think strategically:  \n- This is the Blue team\u2019s turn (your turn).  \n- The upcoming answer phase targets C (Red team).  \n- If C answers correctly (\u201cbox = ball\u201d), Red will get +1.  \n- If C answers incorrectly, Red will get \u22121.\n\nWe want C to be **wrong**.  \n\nYou can take an **Ask**, **Tell**, or **Pass** action:  \n\n- **Ask**: Costs the Blue team 0.5 points, no benefit toward C being wrong (since we ask, they learn info). Not useful.  \n- **Tell**: If we *tell* C a wrong answer, perhaps we can mislead C into answering incorrectly. That can win us a point! A Tell costs 0.5 points, but if it causes Red to lose 1 point, that\u2019s effectively +0.5 net swing for Blue (since Red \u22121, Blue cost \u22120.5 = total +0.5 differential). Excellent move.  \n- **Pass**: Zero cost, but we let Red likely score +1 since C probably knows the real answer.  \n\nTherefore, we should plan to **Tell C a false answer** about the box.\n\nThe true answer = ball. So we should lie and say something else \u2014 e.g. say there\u2019s an **apple** (the earlier object) in the box.  \n\nThus we mislead C into thinking the box contains the apple.  \n\n### \u2705 Optimal Move\n**Tell(C, Box, Apple)**  \n\n(costs us \u22120.5 points, but raises probability that C answers incorrectly, causing Red \u22121 \u21d2 net +0.5 for Blue expected).  \n\n---\n\n**Your action:**  \n`Tell(C, Box, Apple)`",

So B also knows basket = brick.  \n- C: left before D moved brick to box, re-entered *after* that but before you moved it back to basket. So when C re-entered, basket was empty (D had moved brick to box). Then you moved brick to basket after C was already inside. So when you did that, C was in the room\u2014so C saw you move brick into the basket. Then you left. \u2192 C therefore also knows that basket = brick.  \n- D: never left, saw everything. So D also knows basket=brick.  \n\n\u2192 Actually everyone knows the true contents!  \n\nNow the question says:  \n> I am going to ask C what is in the basket.  \n\nSince C knows the correct answer for sure (brick), Red team will likely get +1 unless confusion is sown.\n\nWe are the Blue team (A and B).  \n**Goal:** decrease Red\u2019s expected chance of answering correctly.  \nWe can spend 0.5 points to *Tell* a potentially false statement to C or D to try to mislead them, or *Ask* (pointless here because we already know the truth), or *Pass*.  \n\nIf we *Tell(C, basket, ???)* a false piece of information (say \u201cempty\u201d or \u201cbox\u201d), it costs Blue 0.5 but might make C doubt and possibly answer wrong for -1 Red, net swing +0.5 in our favor (worth it).  \n\nIf we *Tell(C, basket, brick)* we just reinforce the truth\u2014probably not useful.  \n\nStrategically: best is to mislead C by making C believe basket is **empty** (or brick moved to box). Since only C is asked, we should pick something plausible given what C observed.  \n\nWould C believe \u201cbox has the brick\u201d? That\u2019s plausible if C missed something after she left again \u2014 but she didn\u2019t leave again. She saw you move the brick to basket. But maybe we can try to trick her privately: she might think she misremembered or that D moved it again after she wasn\u2019t looking (though she saw you leave, so she knows you can\u2019t move it again). Still, deception is our only hope.\n\nSo optimal: **Tell(C, basket, empty)**. It costs us 0.5 but could cause Red to lose 1.  \n\n\u2705 **Final answer:**  \n**Tell(C, basket, empty)**",

So you know basket = brick.  \n- B was also in the room the whole time (no mention of leaving). So B also knows basket = brick.  \n- C was in the room the whole time (no leaving).

D **leaves** the room.  \n7. You **move banana from basket to bag.**  \n   So basket now: empty.  \n   Bag now: banana.  \n8.

This means either (a) D had an orange unseen by you, or (b) that line is simply describing D\u2019s actions as they happened, but you never observed them.  \n\nWhen **the scenario ends**, you were outside the room when B did the last leave, and now it\u2019s your turn in the **action phase.**  \n\nYou will be asked, *\u201cWhat is in the bag?\u201d*\n\nAt this point, you have incomplete information \u2014 the last confirmed state you personally saw was *\u201cC put an apple in the bag\u201d*, but D later manipulated \"the orange\" while you were away, so the contents of the bag at the end could be *orange*, *apple*, or even *empty*, depending on what really happened.\n\nTo maximize Blue Team's expected score, you should consider possible information sources.  \nThe only other players who might know the final status are:\n- D (who did the last manipulations with the bag and basket)\n- Possibly B or C if they returned later (though timeline suggests D was active last).\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategic move is likely to **Ask D** what\u2019s in the bag, since D is the only one who could have direct and final knowledge. Even if D lies (they\u2019re on Red team), you can still use that information as a clue in future turns. But since this is *your* turn and you will be asked immediately after the action phase, that information could decide the round.  \n\nHowever, asking costs **0.5 points**. If D is your opponent and very likely to lie, the net expected value may be worse than just guessing based on what you last knew.  \nYour last personally confirmed true state is that the bag contained an apple, and you know that D may have swapped something involving an orange \u2014 but you don't know whether an orange existed to begin with. Since the narration explicitly said \"D moves the orange from the bag to the basket\" (describing actual history) and \"moves the orange ... back to the bag\", that description likely reflects real events. Thus, at the end, the bag has the orange.\n\nSo, with high confidence, the **true state** is: *the orange is in the bag.*\n\nYou already know this from the scenario description itself. You do not need to spend points asking.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:** Pass.  \n\n**Your action:** `Pass`",

D now sees subsequent events.\n\n5. **B puts a stapler in the basket.**  \n   We see this.  \n   \u2192 Basket = stapler; Box = apple.\n\n6. **D leaves** again.  \n   D now misses what happens afterward.\n\n7. **D enters** again. D is now back in the room.\n\n8. **We (A) leave the room.**  \n   From this point on, we **cannot see anything else**.  \n   After we left, **C leaves the room**, but we don\u2019t know what happened before or after that, because we\u2019re outside.\n\nSo: the last we witnessed, the **box still contained the apple.** But since we left before the final step where C left, there\u2019s a small possibility C changed something while we were outside (it's plausible).  \n\nHowever, based on what we know, only C might have done something we did not see (since both us and D were in when we left, but D enters after leaving, meaning D might not have changed anything). But we don\u2019t *know* if the box was changed after we left.\n\n### What do we know about others\u2019 knowledge?\n- **B** stayed inside through nearly everything (unless left later we didn\u2019t see, but not stated). B probably knows most.\n- **C** actually did the apple placement, so C *knows* exactly what\u2019s in the box.\n- **D** was in and out, missed the first apple placement, so D doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s in the box definitively.\n- **We (A)** knew it had an apple, but not what could have happened after we left.\n\nThe question we'll be asked: *\u201cWhat is in the box?\u201d*\n\nSince I (A) will have to answer, I want to be sure.  \nI could **Ask** someone who was around and trustworthy (teammate B) or who knows for sure (C). But I know that:  \n- C is on the **Red team**, so if I ask C, C might lie.  \n- B is on my **Blue team**, so B might tell me the truth.\n\nAsking B costs 0.5 points, but ensures we likely give a correct answer worth \u00b11.  \n Passing risks giving wrong answer if something changed after we left.\n\nThus, the optimal action:  \n\u2192 **Ask(B, Box)** \u2014 this is low-cost and likely yields the correct info.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: Ask(B, Box)**",

All (A, B, C, D) in the room.  \n2. D leaves \u2192 D doesn\u2019t know what happens until they re-enter.  \n3. C puts a **brick** in the **box**.  \n   - A, B, C see this. D doesn\u2019t.  \n   \u2192 So box = brick.  \n4. D enters. D now unaware that brick is in box, but sees current state (box has brick).\n5. A leaves \u2192 A now cannot see what happens next.  \n6. A enters \u2192 A missed actions in between, so let\u2019s check what happened while A was out.\n\nWe\u2019re told:  \n> \u2026 You leave the room. \u2026 You enter the room. \u2026 C moves the orange from the box to the basket. \u2026 B moves the orange from the basket to the box. \u2026 D leaves \u2026 D enters \u2026 You leave \u2026 C leaves \u2026\n\nWait \u2014 Something\u2019s odd: when you re-enter, *then* \u201cC moves the orange from the box to the basket.\u201d  \nBut before that, you left. There must have been some events you missed. Let's reconstruct carefully.\n\n### Step 2: Check each event and who\u2019s present\n\n| Step | Event | Who\u2019s in room after event | Box contents | Notes |\n|------|--------|---------------------------|---------------|-------|\n| 1 | Start | A,B,C,D | empty | all aware |\n| 2 | D leaves | A,B,C | empty | D outside |\n| 3 | C puts brick in box | A,B,C | brick | D misses this |\n| 4 | D enters | A,B,C,D | brick | D unaware of history |\n| 5 | A leaves | B,C,D | brick | A misses following events until re-entry |\n| 6 | A enters | A,B,C,D | ??? | We need to see what happened between step 5 and 6 |\n\nNo actions are described between leaving and re-entering in that ellipsis, so nothing may have occurred.  \nThus when A re-enters, box still has **brick**.\n\nNext:\n| Step | Event | Who\u2019s in room | Box contents | Observers |\n|------|--------|---------------|---------------|------------|\n| 7 | C moves orange from box\u2192basket | A,B,C,D |???| but wait\u2014there's no orange in box, there's a brick. That means that sometime before step 7 (probably between 3 and 7) an **orange** appeared in box instead of brick. We were never told who replaced it! That was likely while A was outside or during ellipses.|\n| \u2192 So when A sees this, box apparently had orange, not brick. So A perceives: C moved orange from box to basket. Now box empty, basket orange. |\n| 8 | B moves orange from basket\u2192box | A,B,C,D | box orange | basket empty |\n| 9 | D leaves | A,B,C | box orange |\n| 10 | D enters | A,B,C,D | box orange |\n| 11 | A leaves | B,C,D | box orange |\n| 12 | C leaves | B,D | box orange |\n\n### Step 3: A\u2019s knowledge at the end\nA is currently **outside** (since last event is \u201cyou leave the room\u201d), and C also left after that, so only B and D are inside.  \n\nThe question: \u201cI am going to ask you what is in the box.\u201d\n\nSo when the question is asked, you are outside \u2014 you don\u2019t have direct vision, but you do have memory of past events.  \nThe last thing you saw (right before leaving) was that the box contained the **orange**, and there were **no further changes involving the box** after that (C leaves, but you saw D enter earlier, B remained in the room, no description of box changes).\n\nTherefore, **the true contents (from a God\u2019s-eye perspective) are currently orange**.\n\n### Step 4: Decide on best action\nYou are on the Blue team with B.  \nYou will be asked what\u2019s in the box.  \nYour goal: maximize team score.\n\nYou already *know* what\u2019s in the box (orange).  \nNo uncertainty \u2014 any Ask or Tell costs 0.5 points and adds no new info (since you\u2019re the one being asked next, you already know the answer).\n\nHence, the optimal action is to conserve points by not spending any.  \n\n\u2705 **Optimal move: Pass**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer (your action):**  \n`Pass`",

Actually, check order:  \n  * You put stapler in bag (everyone in room: A,B,C,D).  \n  * Then C left (so C saw stapler action). Wait, the text says: \u201cYou put a stapler in the bag. \u2026 C leaves the room.\u201d So C *was* in the room at that time and did see you put the stapler in the bag.  \n  * Then B leaves (after that).

A puts **ball** in **bag**.  \n2. C leaves \u2014 from this point on, C is unaware of changes.  \n3. B moves **ball** \u2192 from **bag** to **box**.  \n4. D puts **orange** in **bag**.  \n5.

So C\u2019s belief is outdated.  \n\nC thinks (at leaving time):  \n- bag: ball  \n- basket: stapler  \n\nAfter they left, D moved the ball to the box and swapped the stapler back and forth \u2014 but C doesn't know this.  \n\nThe upcoming question:  \n> I am going to ask C what is in the basket.\n\nSo C will *try to answer what C believes* \u2014 and likely say \u201cstapler,\u201d because that was true when C left. That coincidentally is also the correct current answer.  \n\nTherefore, **C will probably answer correctly**, giving Red team +1 unless we intervene.  \n\n**Our goal is to help Blue team (A+B).**  \n\nWe can act now (Ask, Tell, or Pass).  \nAsk costs points (\u22120.5), Tell also costs (\u22120.5).  \n\nWe can only affect Blue team\u2019s knowledge. The upcoming question is for C (Red team).  \nIs there any action that could make C\u2019s answer less accurate?  \n\n- If we *Tell* C something false before the question, we could deceive them. But C is *outside* (we\u2019re not told we can\u2019t communicate), yet by definition Tell actions are private direct communications, regardless of location. We could lie.  \n- If we *Tell(C, basket, [wrong content])*, C would likely use that info to answer \u2014 Red might lose points.  \n\nThis costs Blue 0.5 to Tell, but we could cause Red \u22121 for a net gain of +0.5 overall. That\u2019s beneficial.\n\nWhat lie should we tell?  \nThe *true* content is stapler.  \nWe could tell C that the basket contains the ball.\n\nIf C believes us (they might; we have no reason to think they distrust us yet), C will answer \u201cball,\u201d which is wrong \u2192 Red \u22121 \u2192 Blue gets ahead.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal Move:** Tell(C, basket, ball).  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \n`Tell(C, basket, ball)`",

      "action": "Let's reason carefully.\n\n**What we know:**\n- All four players (A, B, C, D) started in the room.\n- D put an **orange in the box** (everyone saw this).\n- D then put a **banana in the basket** (everyone saw this).\n- Then A (you) left the room.\n- Then B left the room.\n- So at the end of the scenario, **C and D are still in the room.**\n- You do **not** know if anything changed after you left\u2014but the description stops after \u201cB leaves the room.\u201d Since there\u2019s no \u201c\u2026\u201d after that, we assume the scenario ends there.\n\n**The upcoming question:**\n\u201cI am going to ask C what is in the box.\u201d\n\n**C\u2019s knowledge:**  \nAfter A and B left, C (and D) stayed. We don\u2019t know if D might change anything later, but as written, the description ends right after B leaves, suggesting no changes occurred after that. So C still knows the orange is in the box \u2014 unless there\u2019s a twist in a future phase, but we can\u2019t assume that now.\n\n**Goal:**\nWe (Team Blue = A & B) want to maximize our expected points.  \nC (Red team) will be asked the question. If C answers correctly, **Red gains 1 point**; if C answers incorrectly, **Red loses 1 point**.\n\nAs A, your only options cost points for Ask/Tell (0.5 each), or pass for free.\n\nThere\u2019s almost no way for you (A) to influence what C says in this turn, because Ask and Tell actions are *private messages* \u2014 and none of them will reach C this turn\u2019s answer phase (they only matter when the target of the question gets some private communication).\n\nYou could Tell C something false to try to mislead them, but any Tell action **costs 0.5 points**. That could be worth it if it might cause them to answer wrong.\n\n**Would a Tell action work?**  \nWe can do `Tell(C, box, banana)` (a false statement). C might believe it and then answer \u201cbanana,\u201d giving Red \u22121 and Blue +1 total swing of 2 points relative (though cost us 0.5).  \nYes, *that might be optimal*, assuming C believes it.\n\n**Does C have a reason to distrust us?**  \nC knows that A is on the other team. If C is rational, C will not believe what A says. So C will likely *ignore* a Tell from an opponent. Meaning that the Tell doesn\u2019t help us but costs \u22120.5 points directly.\n\nSo the expected value of telling C false info is negative, since C knows we\u2019re not teammates.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nSince C won\u2019t trust us, we can\u2019t influence their answer. The best move is to **do nothing and keep points**.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal Action:**  \n`Pass`",

D puts a **brick** in the **basket**.  \n   \u2192 Basket = brick  \n\n2. You (A) **leave the room**.  \n\n3. While you are **outside**, this happens:  \n   \"C moves the brick from the bag to the basket.\"  \n\n   But we know the bag was empty (no one ever put anything in it). There seems to be a contradiction \u2014 the statement says C moved **the brick from the bag to the basket**, but we know the **brick** was in the **basket** already. So either the statement was mistaken or refers to some other sequence we didn\u2019t see because we were outside.\n\n   Let\u2019s assume we interpret literally the line \u201cC moves the brick from the bag to the basket.\u201d  \n   - That means: before C acted, the **bag contained the brick**, and after, the **basket contains the brick**.  \n   - We didn\u2019t witness how the brick got from basket to bag (it could have happened while we were outside, meaning someone moved it).  \n\n4. Then **C leaves the room**.\n\nAt the end, the only players inside the room are: **A (you)** and **B**.  \nWe know **C** just left and **D** presumably left earlier, or is not mentioned to re-enter, but that doesn\u2019t affect our knowledge.\n\n### Step 2: What you actually know\n- You are missing a piece of time: when you were **outside**, several things could have changed.\n- The only player still in the room who saw everything is **B**.\n\nTherefore, **B** definitely knows the true contents of the basket (since B never left the room).\n\n### Step 3: What to do\nYour goal is to answer correctly what is in the basket after all that.\n\nSince it costs 0 points to Pass but +1 or -1 for correct/incorrect answers, the critical factor is whether knowing for sure (by paying 0.5 point) is worthwhile.\n\nIf you **guess**:\n- 50% chance you\u2019re right \u2192 expectation = +0.5 (0.5\u00d7(+1) + 0.5\u00d7(-1) = 0) actually yields *0 expected* points overall.\nWait, but we don\u2019t even know probabilities \u2014 it\u2019s just uncertain.\n\nIf you **Ask B** about the basket:\n- We pay 0.5 points, but we get certain knowledge of what\u2019s inside (assuming B tells truth).\n\nWe can decide optimally that **B** is a teammate and likely to tell the truth for our team\u2019s benefit.\n\n### Step 4: Optimal action\n\u2192 **Ask(B, Basket)** is the optimal action because:\n- B was inside the room entire time and knows the exact current contents.\n- The cost (\u20130.5) is worth it to secure +1 and avoid potential \u20131 from guessing wrongly.\n\n\u2705 **Final Action:**  \n**Ask(B, Basket)**",

Wait. \u201cMoves the apple\u201d?  \n    But we saw a *brick* go into the basket; at no point did anyone put an *apple* anywhere that we know of.  \n    That suggests while you were **outside**, someone might have swapped things, but you have no record of it.  \n    However, the narration says *\u201cD moves the apple from the basket to the bag.\u201d*  \n    Because you are *inside* for this event, you **see** D take an apple out of the basket and put it in the bag.  \n    So, at this point (you are inside and observing): basket\u202fbecomes\u202fempty, bag\u202f=\u202fapple.\n\n12. **D moves the apple from the bag to the basket.**  \n    You are still inside, so you see this: bag\u202f\u2192\u202fempty; basket\u202f=\u202fapple.\n\n13. **D leaves.**  \n    Basket\u202f=\u202fapple currently.\n\n14. **D enters.**\n\n15. **You leave.**  \n    (Now you don\u2019t know what happens next.)\n\n16. **B enters.**\n\n17. **B leaves.**\n\nNo events after that involving moving objects.\n\nSo at the last point you *were inside*, the basket contained an **apple**, and since after you left and before the question none of the listed events involved moving objects (only entering/leaving), nothing changes.  \n\nTherefore, the *true* contents are **apple**.\n\nNow, it\u2019s the **action phase**, and we know the final answer.  \nBlue team currently 0\u20130.\n\nYou could:  \n- Pass (cost\u202f0\u202fpoints; we already know the correct content).  \n- Ask or Tell would cost 0.5\u202fpoints but give no benefit, since you already know what\u2019s in the basket.\n\nSo the optimal action for your team is:\n\n\u2705 **Pass**\n\n---\n\n**Your action:** Pass",

So basket = stapler.\n\n**Then:**  \n- You **leave** the room.  \n- While you are gone:  \n  - You are unaware of what happens between your leaving and your next entering.  \n- You **enter** the room again. (You are now back inside.)\n\nAfter you return, the following occur **while you are inside**:  \n1. C moves stapler **from basket \u2192 bag**. (So bag = stapler, basket = empty.)  \n2. B moves stapler **from bag \u2192 basket**. (So basket = stapler, bag = empty.)  \n3. B leaves the room.  \n4. B enters the room again.  \n(You are still inside this whole time.)  \n5. You leave the room.  \n\n---\n\n### What does each player know?\n\n**You (A):**\n- You saw C put stapler in basket.\n- You were out of the room during some unknown time (maybe nothing happened\u2014we only know what\u2019s listed).\n- When you came back, you saw C move stapler from basket \u2192 bag.  \n- Then you saw B move stapler from bag \u2192 basket.\n- You saw B leave and re-enter (no objects moved at that point).  \n- Then you left.\n\n\u2192 So, **the last thing you directly saw before leaving** was that stapler was in **basket**.  \nThus, unless something happened *after you left*, the basket still contains the stapler.\n\n**Who was in the room when you left?**\n- When you leave, B is back inside, as you saw him re-enter.\n- C\u2019s presence never changed (C never left the room).\n\u2192 So **B and C remained inside** after you left, and *they could have changed something* after you departed.  \nYou do not know what happened inside after you left.\n\n---\n\n### Strategic reasoning\n\nThe question to be asked (in answer phase): \u201cWhat is in the basket?\u201d\n\n- You will have to answer it.\n- Right now, you are missing potential knowledge from after you left.\n- The only people who could know for sure are **B** and **C**, since they remained inside after you left.  \n- **B** is your *teammate*. **C** is an *opponent*.\n\n---\n\n### Action choices\n\nYou can:\n\n1. **Ask(B, basket)** \u2014 cost 0.5 point, might yield the correct information (if B tells truth).\n2. **Ask(C, basket)** \u2014 cost 0.5 point, but C is opponent, is unlikely to tell truth.\n3. **Tell(...)** \u2014 wastes information, costs 0.5.\n4. **Pass** \u2014 cost 0, rely on reasoning, risk that C or B may have moved object after you left.\n\nWe don\u2019t *know* any reason to suspect a move occurred after you left\u2014the scenario ended right after your departure.  \nThus, the simplest reading is that the stapler remains in the basket.\n\nGiven that, we **already have a sufficiently strong inference** that the basket contains the stapler, and paying a 0.5 cost is unnecessary\u2014your reasoning is probably fully accurate.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:**  \n`Pass`\n\n(cost 0, and you already have the information)",

After that, no one touched the box again.  \n     \u2192 So **box contains a brick**.\n\n   - **Bag:** The apple was moved in and out a few times, but not at the very end.  \n     \u2192 The final move was *you moving the apple from the bag to the basket*. So **the bag is empty**.\n\n   - **Basket:** You moved the apple there last.  \n     \u2192 So **basket contains an apple**.\n\n2. **Who knows what:**\n   - **You (A):** Saw everything that happened in detail because you never left the room.\n   - **B:** Left **after putting brick in box** and saw the apple put in bag before leaving.\n     \u2192 So B *doesn't know* about the later movements involving the apple or that the box remained untouched.\n     \u2192 B *believes*: apple in bag, brick in box.\n   - **C:** Stayed after B left, saw the apple movements afterward. So C knows final states correctly.\n   - **D:** Left early, doesn\u2019t know later changes.\n\n### Question:\n> I am going to ask B what is in the box.\n\nWe need to maximize Blue Team\u2019s chance of scoring points.  \nYou and B are on the **Blue team**. So if B gets it right, Blue +1; if wrong, Blue \u22121.\n\nCurrently, B *should already know* what\u2019s in the box (brick), because B personally placed it there and no one touched it after.  \nSo B\u2019s answer will almost certainly be correct. Telling or asking anything risks confusing B, or costs points unnecessarily.\n\n### Optimal play reasoning:\n- **Ask** or **Tell** costs 0.5 points.  \n- **Passing** costs 0 points.\n- Since B already will likely be correct (box = brick), the expected benefit of communication is low.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal Action: Pass**\n\n---\n\n**Your action:** `Pass`",

Nothing else ever happened to the bag, so it still contains the stapler.  \n- **Box and Basket:** There was a sequence of brick movements between them, but that doesn\u2019t affect the bag.\n\n**Who knows what:**\n\n- You, B, and C were in the room at the start.\n- C left **after** B put the stapler in the bag \u2014 so C *knows* the stapler was in the bag when they left.\n- After C left, only you and B remained and no one touched the bag again.\n\nTherefore:\n- You know exactly what\u2019s in the bag (stapler).  \n- B also knows\u2014since B was the one who put it there and never saw anyone move it afterward.\n\n**Upcoming question:**  \n> \u201cI am going to ask B what is in the bag.\u201d\n\nB\u2019s answer will directly determine whether Blue team gains or loses a point. If B remembers correctly, your team will score +1. But if B is confused or suspects trickery, they could still answer incorrectly (intentionally or by mistake).  \n\n**Options:**\n1. **Pass** (cost 0): rely on B to answer correctly (likely outcome).\n2. **Tell(B, bag, stapler)**: would remind B at a cost of 0.5 points. That only helps if B were unsure\u2014but there\u2019s no reason for that, as B did it themself.\n3. **Ask** anything: costs 0.5 and gives us no extra scoring advantage here.\n\n**Optimal play:**  \nB definitely knows they put the stapler in the bag.

When D reenters, C is still there; then later B reenters while D and C are presumably still there, and then B leaves again. Therefore, B\u2019s knowledge is quite uncertain unless someone told B or B saw the change directly.\n\n**What do we know as Player A?**\n- We are 100% sure that, at least when we left, the stapler was in the basket.  \n- After that, things may have changed (C was alone in the room for a while).\n\n**Who is being asked?**\n\u27a1\ufe0f B is being asked what\u2019s in the basket.\n\n**Goal:**\nMaximize our team\u2019s (Blue team\u2019s) chance of B getting it right.\n\nYou can communicate privately. \u201cAsk\u201d or \u201cTell\u201d costs 0.5 points; the correct answer earns +1, incorrect loses -1.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- We can directly **Tell(B, basket, stapler)**.  \n- Cost: \u22120.5 points, but if B answers correctly it earns +1 point, for a net +0.5 points if B then says \u201cstapler\u201d correctly.\n- Risk: If the stapler was moved, telling B \u201cstapler\u201d misleads him, but unless we have reason to believe Red altered it, that\u2019s still our best chance.\n- Since only C and D are Red, they might try to change the contents to mislead us. But we haven\u2019t seen D put or remove anything. C was alone for a bit, so a change is possible but unconfirmed.\n\nWith limited information, the expected value is highest if we attempt to coordinate rather than do nothing.

Red=0.\n\nIf C answers correctly (which they will unless they get wrong information), Red = +1.\n\nWe want to prevent that or make them answer wrong.\n\nWe can mislead C using a Tell action.\n\nIf we Tell C a false container content, and they believe us, they could answer wrong \u2192 Red \u22121, great for us.\n\n**If we Tell(C, Box, stapler)** \u2014 that might convince them the box has a stapler, but it costs Blue 0.5 points.\n\nIf they then answer \u201cstapler\u201d, that is incorrect \u2192 Red \u22121.  \nNet score effect: Blue \u22120.5 (cost) vs Red \u22121 (loss) \u2192 relative swing of +0.5 for Blue.\n\nThat is good.\n\nAlternatively, if we Pass, we pay 0, but C will answer correctly \u2192 Red +1, relative swing \u22121 for Blue. So Pass is much worse.\n\nSo best play: **Tell(C, Box, stapler)** (the wrong item). If C believes us, Red loses a point.\n\n**Action:**\n```\nTell(C, Box, stapler)\n```",

What actually happened\nWe know *the true current state* because we left near the end and saw all movements before that:\n1. **Start:** basket empty, bag empty, box empty.\n2. **C** puts banana **in basket**.\n3. **C leaves.**\n4. **D** moves banana **basket \u2192 bag**.\n   - So banana is now in the **bag**.\n5. **C enters.**\n6. **D** moves banana **bag \u2192 basket** \u2014 and now both C and D are present in the room.\n   - So banana is back in the **basket**.\n7. **You (A)** leave the room.\n8. **B** leaves the room.\n   - We (A) and B are now both outside. C and D are inside.\n\nFinal known true configuration: **banana in basket**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2. Who knows what\n- **You (A)**: You saw D move the banana from bag to basket before leaving. You know the banana is in the basket.  \n- **B**: Was in the room for everything until after the final move? Let\u2019s reread carefully: after D moved the banana bag\u2192basket, *then* you left, then B left. This means B also saw everything.  \n  \u2705 So B also knows banana in basket.  \n- **C**: Left, then later reentered before the final change. C was *present* in the room when D moved banana *back* into the basket. So C knows the *banana is in basket* currently.  \n  \u2705 So C also knows banana in basket.\n- **D**: Did all the moves. Also knows.\n\nSo everyone actually knows the banana is in the basket.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3. Objective of this turn\nYou know that **C** (Red team) will be asked the question:  \n> \u201cC, what is in the basket?\u201d\n\nIf C answers correctly (\u201cbanana\u201d), **Red team gains 1 point** (bad for us).  \nIf C answers incorrectly, **Red team loses 1 point** (good for us).  \n\nSo we want to make **C say something wrong**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4. What actions can we do?\nWe can:\n- Ask(Player, Container) \u2013 costs 0.5 points. We would learn something but everyone already knows everything.\n- Tell(Player, Container, Contents) \u2013 costs 0.5 points. We can send potential misinformation.\n- Pass \u2013 costs nothing.\n\nWe can only act once.\n\nThe only way to affect outcome is if our action influences what C thinks or says.\n\nRight now, C believes banana is in the basket. If we can make C *doubt or be misinformed*, maybe they\u2019ll answer wrong.\n\nWe can **Tell(C, basket, bag)** for example\u2014saying \u201cthe bag contains the banana.\u201d But the format must be **Tell(C, Container, Contents)**, where *Contents* refer to what we tell about that container. Example:\n> Tell(C, basket, bag) \u2014 this would mean we tell C that the basket contains the bag (which is nonsensical, since containers can\u2019t contain each other).  \n\nWe instead need to tell them something plausible, like:\n> Tell(C, basket, apple) \u2014 telling them that the basket has an apple instead of banana.\n\nThat may mislead C.\n\n**Cost/benefit analysis:**\n- Cost: -0.5 points (for Blue).\n- Expected benefit: If C believes and answers incorrectly, Red gets -1 \u2192 Blue effectively +1 relative to them (a net +1.5 advantage).\n- Unless C doesn\u2019t believe us or chooses to ignore, we lose only 0.5.\n\nSo **best move** is to *lie to C* about contents of the basket.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Optimal Action:**\n```\nTell(C, basket, apple)\n```",

Hence C knows the stapler is in the box.  \n\nTherefore, when the moderator asks C, \u201cWhat is in the box?\u201d, C will answer correctly with \u201cstapler.\u201d  \n\nCurrent planned score effect: Blue +0 if we Pass, because C will answer correctly anyway (Red gets +1). Our team (Blue) would not influence that with any action since we\u2019d lose \u22120.5 if we act.  \n\nHowever, the question is: can we do anything to improve?  \nWe can try to confuse or mislead C, but cross\u2011team communication is private\u2014Red\u2019s communication is separate. It\u2019s Blue\u2019s turn, so we can only act to help our team. If we Tell or Ask a Red player something false, they might be confused\u2014but it costs us 0.5 points, and there\u2019s no guarantee that C would believe us instead of her own observation.  \n\nC saw the action herself (the stapler put in the box). She has firsthand information. A deceptive Tell is unlikely to convince her to deny what she knows, since in rational deduction games players trust their own observation most.  \n\nSo acting costs us points but provides no realistic gain.  \n\n\u2705 **Best move: Pass.**\n\n**Your action: Pass**",

So at some point while you were outside, someone moved the apple from the bag **to the box** (unknown to you who did it).

D leaves \u2192 now A, B, C remain.  \n2. B leaves \u2192 now A, C remain.  \n3. You (A) put an *orange* in the bag. \u2192 bag = orange.  \n4. B enters. \u2192 A, B, C are in the room.  \n5. D enters \u2192 everyone A, B, C, D in room.  \n6. You leave \u2192 A outside, B, C, D inside.  \n7. B leaves \u2192 B outside, C, D in.  \n8. C leaves \u2192 only D in.  \n9. You enter \u2192 A, D in.  \n10. D moves the *apple* from the bag to the basket. Wait\u2014there was no apple in the bag! You placed an orange earlier. So D\u2019s action implies D **believes** or **acts as if** there was an apple; maybe they substituted the orange, or replaced the item but didn\u2019t show it to you. Let\u2019s note: D moved an *apple* from bag to basket; so now the bag became empty, and the basket holds *apple*.  \n11. D moves the *apple* from the basket to the bag \u2192 bag now = apple, basket empty.  \n12. D leaves the room.  \n13. D enters the room.  \n14. You leave.  \n15. B enters.  \n16. B leaves.  \n\nSo, at the end of all this:  \n- The last *known manipulation* was D putting the apple back into the bag.  \n- After that, D only left, entered (no manipulation), and eventually left you not present.  \n\nThus, from the **omniscient description**, the *actual* final contents of the bag \u2192 **apple**.  \n\nNow, what do *you*, as A, know?  \n\nYou witnessed up to when you left the room the **second time** at step 14.  \nWhen you were in the room (after step 9, before step 14):  \n- You were present when D moved the apple from bag\u2192basket\u2192bag.  \nTherefore, **you know** those occurred, and you know bag ended up with the apple.  \n\nSo your personal knowledge = bag has apple.  \n\n### In the answer phase, you will be asked: \"What is in the bag?\"  \nIf you answer correctly, your team gains +1.  \nCurrently: Blue=0, Red=0.\n\n### During your **action phase**, you may:\n- **Pass** (0 points cost)\n- **Ask** (cost 0.5)\n- **Tell** (cost 0.5)\n\nAt this point, you already know the correct contents of the bag.  \nAsking or telling would cost your team 0.5 points for no reason, since you know the answer and you are the one who will be asked.  \n\nTherefore, the **optimal action** is to:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Pass**\n\n---\n\n**Your action:** Pass",

B is outside when asked what\u2019s in the bag.\n\n**Who knows the truth:**\n- You know that at some earlier time, C put an apple in the bag.\n- You do **not** know if C or D changed the contents afterward (because you were out).\n- B never saw C put the apple in (B left after you left, but C could have changed things later).\n\n**The host is going to ask B** what\u2019s in the bag.  \nB might or might not know.

What each player knows\n- **A (you):** You saw *everything.* You know basket has a brick.  \n- **B:** B left before final banana movements, so they think banana is still in **bag**, basket still has **brick**.  \n- **C:** Left very early. They last saw banana in **basket.** They are unaware of all subsequent movements after they left.  \n- **D:** Stayed after C left. D saw all moves after that, including final one.

So C and D end up remaining in the room at the end.  \n- C has been in the room the entire time; C saw absolutely everything that happened.\n\nThe **final question** will be: *\"What is in the basket?\"* asked to C.\n\nWe (Team Blue: A and B) want to maximize our team's score.  \n- C is on the **Red team**, so we want *C to answer incorrectly*.\n\nC has all the information (they saw everything, including D\u2019s potential manipulation when you were outside). We cannot observe what D might have changed, but being Red teammates, C probably knows the true contents\u2014or can deduce them based on seeing D act.\n\n**Our possible actions:**\n- Ask someone: costs 0.5 points.\n- Tell someone: costs 0.5 points.\n- Pass: costs 0 points.\n\nIf you *Ask* C \u201cwhat\u2019s in the basket,\u201d it costs 0.5 points and gives you a sense of what C knows, but C will not be affected (C still knows the truth).  \nIf you *Tell* C something false (e.g., Tell(C, basket, \"banana\")), you\u2019d make C *hear* that misleading information \u2014 that could make C doubt or be wrong later, and it costs 0.5 points.  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of action that could potentially reduce Red\u2019s accuracy if it confuses C.\n\nSince we know you (A) put a stapler in there originally, but D might have changed something while you were gone\u2014still, C saw everything. The only way to make C\u2019s final answer potentially wrong is to **mislead** them with a plausible false \u201cTell\u201d message.\n\nThe cost of -0.5 might be worth it since wrong answers reduce Red\u2019s score by 1 point.\n\nSo the **optimal play** is to *Tell(C, basket, banana)* (a plausible false claim).  \nThat way, if C trusts you (since you were the one who put the stapler in first), C might answer \u201cbanana\u201d instead of the truth, hurting Red\u2019s score.\n\n\u2705 **Action:** `Tell(C, basket, banana)`",

So C *also* knows basket \u2192 stapler.\n\n### What D knows\n- D entered and left multiple times, but you don\u2019t know exactly what happened *while* D was in each time \u2014 D might have changed something.\n- However, since you left after D\u2019s third entry, and B left immediately after, you no longer have updates after that.\n\nWe\u2019re told **C will be asked what\u2019s in the basket.**\n\n### Goal\nMaximize Blue team\u2019s expected points.  \nRight now, C (on Red team) knows the true answer: basket \u2192 stapler.  \nIf you do *nothing*, C will answer correctly and **Red +1**.\n\nWe could **try to confuse or mislead C**, but the only way to do that is by using a *Tell* (which you can send privately to any player).\n\nHowever, since C already *saw* you put the stapler in the basket, they probably won\u2019t believe a random contradictory Tell from you\u2014they witnessed it firsthand, so deception won\u2019t work.\n\nBut the game rules say \u201cplayers may lie,\u201d so maybe we could manipulate *what C is aware of during the record*. Still, no way\u2014they *were in the room the whole time*. So any Tell/Ask only burns our points.\n\n### Best action\nPassing costs 0 and doesn\u2019t worsen our score.\nIf we Tell or Ask anyone, we lose 0.5 points and C still likely answers correctly (since C saw everything).\n\n\u2705 **Optimal move:** Pass\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**Pass**",

So C genuinely knows the orange is in the basket.\n- **D**: Also knows.\n- **You and B**: Know indirectly what happened, but now outside.  \n\nThe question will be asked to **C**, and C is on the **Red team** (the opposing team).  \n\nIf C correctly says \u201corange,\u201d Red gets +1 point. If C gives the wrong answer, Red loses 1 point.\n\nWe (Blue team) want C to be *wrong*.\n\n### Our possible influence\nAny Ask or Tell costs us 0.5 points.  Only private tells or asks between two players matter. Right now, it\u2019s our (A\u2019s) turn.\n\nWhom can we influence? Possibly B (teammate) or someone on the Red team (C or D).  \nSince C is going to be *asked directly* by the game host, we might try to *mislead* C about the basket\u2019s contents.\n\n### Strategic options\n1. **Tell(C, Basket, BoxEmptyOrSomethingFalse)** or **Tell(C, Basket, BoxHasOrange)** etc.\u2014try to confuse C.\n   - Telling costs 0.5 points, but can make C answer incorrectly and gain Blue +1 net (since Red \u22121). That swing = +1 for us, \u22121 for them, effective +2 relative points difference, less 0.5 cost = +1.5 swing to Blue.  \n   - So it\u2019s worthwhile.\n\n2. **Ask** actions cost 0.5 and just gather info\u2014we already know everything. So no reason to Ask.\n\n3. **Pass**: costs nothing but misses chance to mislead the opponent.\n\nThus the best move is a **Tell** that causes C to be wrong.\n\n### What to tell C?\nC saw D move the orange *back into the basket*. So C knows it\u2019s there; unless we present strong contradictory info, C will answer \u201corange.\u201d  \nHowever, as A, you are trustworthy? C knows you left *before* the end.

That is plausible.\n\n    So when you come back, C talks about moving \u201cthe brick from the basket to the box\u201d \u2192 this is consistent with C having secretly changed the basket\u2019s contents.\n\n12. **C moves the brick from the box to the basket.**  \n    So, after all that, the basket\u2019s final contents are again the **brick**.\n\n13. **You leave the room.**  \n    \u2192 You won\u2019t see what happens after this.\n\n14. **B enters the room.**  \n    \u2192 B enters but (since C and D have left, apparently) B wouldn\u2019t see or change anything.\n\n15. **B leaves the room.**\n\n---\n\n**Final participant inside actions:**\n- The last action affecting the basket was: *C moves the brick from the box to the basket.*\n\nTherefore, the current content of the basket (based on observed actions) should be **a brick**.\n\n---\n\n**Now, ACTION PHASE:**\nYou already know the answer from observation (\u201cbasket \u2192 brick\u201d).  \nThere\u2019s no benefit to asking or telling here \u2014 Ask or Tell costs 0.5 points and risks revealing info.  \nSo the optimal, point-maximizing move is simply to **Pass**.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Your action:** `Pass`",

You know the **bag now contains a stapler**.\n4. **D enters the room.**\n   - Now everyone A, B, C, D are inside.\n   - You still know the bag has a stapler.\n5. **You (A) leave the room.**\n   - Outside now. You won\u2019t see what happens next.\n6. **You enter the room again.**\n   - You re-enter, currently in the room with whoever is present.\n7. **B moves the apple from the bag to the basket.**\n   - Wait \u2014 but you didn\u2019t see an apple get into the bag at any point.  \n     You did *not* see this, because you are *inside the room* at this moment (since you just re-entered before it happened). Thus you *do* witness this event.\n     That implies that *somehow* there was an apple in the bag (unknown to you previously). Perhaps one of the other players (C or D) placed it there while you were out.\n   - After this, bag no longer has an apple (it was moved), and basket now has an apple.\n8. **D moves the apple from the basket to the bag.**\n   - You are still inside the room. You see D move the apple back to the bag.\n   - Now the apple is in the bag (not the stapler).\n   - So final known state to you: the **bag contains an apple**, the **basket is empty**.\n9. **You leave the room.**\n   - You leave.\n10. **C leaves the room.**\n   - That\u2019s the end. D and B remain in the room (they might know the final state; depends if something changed after you left).\n\n### Net summary (what you, A, know)\nWhen you left (step 9), the **bag contained an apple**.  \nYou saw no subsequent events happen after you left, so that\u2019s what you should believe is still in the bag.\n\n### However\nThe **question** will ask for the content of the bag, but at that moment (the question is for *you*). You will be asked directly \u2014 and since you already have complete and correct information, there is **no need to use Ask or Tell**, because that costs you -0.5 points and does not gain accuracy.\n\n### Best action\n**\"Pass.\"**\n\nBecause:\n- You already know the correct answer (apple in the bag).\n- Any Ask or Tell wastes 0.5 points or risks misinformation.\n\n\u2705 **Your action:** `Pass`",

D doesn\u2019t see anything after this point.\n3. **You** move **ball** from **basket** to **box** \u2192 basket empty, box = ball\n4. **You** put a **stapler** in **basket** \u2192 basket = stapler\n5. **B leaves the room**. B sees up through this point (so B saw that you put a stapler in the basket).\n6. **C** moves **stapler** from **basket \u2192 bag** \u2192 bag = stapler, basket empty\n7. **C** moves **stapler** from **bag \u2192 basket** \u2192 bag empty, basket = stapler\n\n#### Final situation:\n- bag = empty  \n- box = ball  \n- basket = stapler  \n\n### Who knows what?\n- You: saw everything; you know basket = stapler.\n- C: saw everything from when D left (was present the whole time?), yes, C knows final state too.\n- B: **left before** those last two moves by C. So B thinks basket has stapler (because last thing B saw: you put stapler there). **Oh wait**\u2014B left *after* you put stapler in basket, but *before* C moved it around and back. So B\u2019s belief matches the final state by coincidence \u2014basket = stapler\u2014 even though B doesn\u2019t know C\u2019s actions.  \n- D: left early; last saw basket=ball. D would think basket=ball.\n\nSo B will answer correctly (basket = stapler) **by luck**, not reasoning, but that\u2019s fine.\n\n### Decision\nSince B is about to be asked, if we let it happen, B will probably say \u201cstapler\u201d, which is actually correct.

We want our team (Blue: A and B) to score points.  \n\nIf we do nothing (Pass), B will answer \u201cstapler,\u201d and Blue will gain +1 point.  \nIf we do anything (Ask/Tell), it would cost us 0.5 points without improving accuracy at all.  \n\n\u2705 **Optimal action: Pass**  \n\nYour action: **Pass**",

B enters the room \u2192 now B is inside (with A, C; D outside).\n   By this point, B does not know what happened when he was gone.\n   He doesn\u2019t yet know the stapler is in the bag.\n6.

If D answers correctly, Red +1. If incorrectly, Red \u20131.  \nWe can act now to *try to make D give a wrong answer.*\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- D is outside the room.\n- The current truth: Box = ball.\n- D believes Box = ball.  \nSo unless we confuse D, they\u2019ll likely say \u201cball,\u201d which would be *correct*.\n\n---\n\n**Our options:**\n- **Ask(...)** costs 0.5, doesn't affect D directly (private). Not useful here.\n- **Tell(D, Container, Contents)** could mislead D into giving a wrong answer\u2014but we pay 0.5 points to mislead.\n- If we tell D something false and they believe us, the Red team could lose 1 point while we lose 0.5 \u2192 net +0.5 advantage to us.  \n  That\u2019s better than doing nothing if we\u2019re convincing.\n\n---\n\n**Best move:**  \nTell(D, Box, [something false]) \u2014 ideally contradict their belief in a believable way.\n\nIf we say \u201cThe box is empty,\u201d that sounds plausible because people have been moving things around while D was outside. D might believe it.\n\n**Recommended Action:**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Tell(D, Box, empty)**  \n\nThat will cost Blue 0.5 points but may cause D to answer incorrectly, yielding a net advantage.  \n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Final Answer:**  \n**Tell(D, Box, empty)**",

You put a **banana** in the **bag**.  \n   Bag: banana\n3. **D leaves** the room (D no longer sees inside-room actions).\n4. **C moves banana** from bag \u2192 basket.  \n   Bag: empty, Basket: banana.\n5. **B moves** the banana from basket \u2192 bag.  \n   Basket empty, Bag: banana.\n6. **B moves** the banana from bag \u2192 box.  \n   Bag empty, Box: banana.\n7. You put a **brick** in the **bag**.  \n   Bag: brick, Box: banana.\n8. **B leaves the room.**\n\nSo current state (you and C inside):\n- Bag: brick  \n- Box: banana  \n- Basket: empty  \n- B & D outside (B left after everything; D left early)\n\n### What will happen next\n- The question to D will be: **\"What is in the bag?\"**\n\n### Who knows the correct answer\n- You know the bag contains a **brick**.\n- C knows it\u2019s a brick (C was inside for all subsequent updates).\n- B knows it\u2019s a brick, because B saw you put a brick in before B left? Wait: let\u2019s check that \u2014 B left *after* you put the brick in, so yes, B saw it happen, so B knows too.\n- D **does not know**: D left before C moved the banana, so D still believes the **bag has a banana** (since when D left, banana was in the bag).\n\nSo D\u2019s belief = *banana in the bag*  \nReality = *brick in the bag*.\n\n### The question\nI (the game host) will ask **D** what is in the bag.\n\nIf D says \u201cbanana\u201d \u2192 Red team scores **\u22121 point**.  \nIf D somehow learns from C (their teammate) that it\u2019s actually \u201cbrick\u201d \u2192 Red team scores **+1 point**.\n\n### Our goal\nWe are Blue team (A + B), so we want **D to answer incorrectly**.\n\nTherefore, our optimal action is to **not give D or C any correct information** about what\u2019s actually in the bag.  \nSince it costs points to act (Ask or Tell = \u22120.5), and there\u2019s no opportunity to affect D directly in time (they\u2019re not here), the optimal move is to **do nothing**.\n\n### \u2705 Optimal action:\n**Pass**\n\n---\n\n**Your action:** Pass",

But telling D something is risky: if you tell D the truth (that it\u2019s brick), they\u2019ll answer correctly and get **+1 for Red**. If you lie to D (say \"orange\") they would answer with your reinforcement but that would be wrong and **Red loses 1**. Hence telling D anything is risky, but maybe strategically beneficial if it encourages them to be wrong.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\n#### Option 1: Pass\nIf you do nothing, D will likely say \u201corange\u201d (wrong) \u2192 Red -1.  \nBlue remains at 0.  \nSo net outcome: Blue leads 1\u20130 (effectively, since Red -1). Excellent for Blue.\n\n#### Option 2: Ask someone (cost -0.5)\nPointless: you already know the basket content. This just wastes 0.5 points.\n\n#### Option 3: Tell someone\n- **Tell D (Basket, brick)**: then Red will get it right \u2192 Red +1. Bad for Blue.\n- **Tell D (Basket, orange)** (lie): Red will keep being wrong. D still believes it\u2019s orange anyway, no change from doing nothing, but now you lose 0.5 points. Worse than Pass.\n- **Tell B (Basket, brick)** or **Tell C**: irrelevant, because the host will ask D.\n\nSo the best move is minimal: **do nothing**.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:** **Pass**",

D knows the bag now has an orange. So D will (truthfully) be able to answer \u201corange.\u201d  \n\nYou are on Blue team (A+B). D is on Red team (C+D). If D answers *correctly*, Red gains +1.  \n\nTherefore, you want to **reduce the chance that D answers correctly**.\n\nWhat can your action accomplish?\n\nYou can:\n- **Ask** someone the contents of a container (costs 0.5 pts, gives you info privately). But you already know the truth.  \n- **Tell** someone the contents of a container (costs 0.5 pts, gives them info; you may lie). You *could* try to mislead D.  \n- Or **Pass** (costs nothing and doesn\u2019t risk helping anyone).\n\nIf you *Tell(D, bag, apple)* \u2014 i.e., lie to D \u2014 it costs you 0.5 pt but might cause D to answer \u201capple.\u201d  \nIf D believes you and answers \u201capple,\u201d Red would get \u22121, and your team would lose 0.5 (cost of tell), net gain +0.5 difference.  \nSo strategically that\u2019s good **if D believes you**.  \nIf D doesn\u2019t trust you (since you\u2019re on opposite teams), you pay 0.5 for nothing.  \n\nIn this setup, we assume rational players; D likely knows you want to mislead them. So **telling D the wrong thing probably doesn\u2019t deceive them**.  \n\nBut there\u2019s also no advantage to misleading B (since B isn\u2019t being asked).  \nNo need to ask anyone; you already know the answer.\n\nHence: **Pass** is optimal \u2014 it costs nothing, and your team avoids unnecessary point loss.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:** Pass",

However, since D was inside for everything after B left (D did all apple moves and also saw C put the orange in the bag), D already knows the bag has the orange!

D puts stapler in bag \u2192 Everyone sees: bag = stapler\n2. D leaves room \u2192 D outside\n3. C moves stapler bag \u2192 basket \u2192 A, B, C see this; D does not\n\u2003Now bag = empty, basket = stapler\n4. D enters the room \u2192 D now back in, sees the current state as basket = stapler, bag = empty\n5. C moves stapler basket \u2192 bag \u2192 A, B, C, D all see this (all are in the room).  \n\u2003Now bag = stapler\n6. B leaves room \u2192 B outside\n7. D moves stapler bag \u2192 box \u2192 A, C, D see this; B does *not*  \n\u2003Now bag = empty, box = stapler\n8. C puts orange in bag \u2192 A, C, D see this; B does *not*  \n\u2003Now bag = orange, box = stapler\n9. A leaves room \u2192 A outside\n10. B enters room \u2192 B inside\n\u2003At this moment: Inside = B, C, D. Bag = orange, box = stapler.\n\u2003B sees the current state (C and D are inside so B sees C and D in room, but not contents since containers are opaque).\n11. B leaves room again \u2192 B outside.\n\n### What D knows\nLet\u2019s examine D\u2019s knowledge:\n- Step 1: D puts stapler in bag \u2192 bag = stapler\n- Step 2: D outside: unaware that C moves stapler bag\u2192basket\n- Step 4: D reenters, sees basket = stapler, bag empty? Wait\u2014players cannot see inside containers, but D doesn\u2019t directly see inside. However, D did not see that C moved stapler out earlier, so from D\u2019s perspective, last he saw, bag had stapler, and since D cannot see inside, he might *think* stapler still in bag.\nThen: step 5 C moves stapler basket\u2192bag (everyone sees this, including D). So from D\u2019s perspective, that reinforces \u201cstapler is in bag.\u201d\nStep 6 B leaves, Step 7 D moves stapler bag\u2192box (D knows that he moved it).\nSo D knows stapler in box after step 7.\nThen step 8 C puts orange in bag (D sees that, as D is inside). So D knows bag = orange.\nThus D is aware: bag = orange, box = stapler.\n\n### So correct answer that D *should give if truthful*: **orange**\n\n### You (A)\u2019s knowledge\nYou were in the room up through step 8, so you saw D move stapler bag\u2192box and C put orange in bag. Then you left. So you also know bag = orange.\n\nThus YOU know the true answer.\n\n### The question:\u00a0\u201cI am going to ask D what is in the bag.\u201d\n\nIf D answers truthfully, Red earns +1.  \nWe want Red to be wrong, but we can\u2019t interact with D directly (we can ask or tell any player, though).  \n\nHowever, you can choose an action costing up to 0.5 points if it might make D give a wrong answer.\n\nCan we mislead D? Possibly with **Tell(D, bag, WrongContents)**.  \nFor example, \u201cTell(D, bag, stapler).\u201d Cost: 0.5 for our team, but if D is fooled into answering \u201cstapler,\u201d Red loses 1 and we gain 1 (net +1.0\u20130.5 = +0.5 swing for Blue).\n\nIf D is not fooled, we just spent \u20130.5 with no benefit.  \nTelling D something false is the only way to affect his answer, since he is the one being asked.\n\n**Tell(D, bag, stapler)** seems like the best strategic action \u2014 it costs us 0.5, but has potential upside of +2 swing (since correct\u2192Red+1; incorrect\u2192Red\u20131), a total 1.5 difference in relative points, expected value positive if there\u2019s nontrivial chance he\u2019s fooled.\n\n### \u2705 Optimal move:\n**Tell(D, bag, stapler)**",

You leave the room.  \u2192 C and D remain inside; B\u2019s presence not explicitly stated, but since only **you** are said to leave, B, C, D remain inside.\n\n**After A leaves:**\n- While you\u2019re outside, you don\u2019t know what happens next. But since no further actions were described after you left, we assume *nothing else happened before the scenario ended.*\n\nThus, at the end of the scenario (from the total information given):  \n- Basket: stapler  \n- Bag: brick  \n- Box: empty  \n\n---\n\n**Question:** \u201cI am going to ask C what is in the basket.\u201d\n\nC\u2019s knowledge: C was present for every action; C never left.  \nSo C *knows* that the stapler is in the basket.  \nC\u2019s expected answer will therefore be **\u201cstapler\u201d**, which is correct.  \nThis means Red team (C and D) will gain +1 point unless we do something.\n\n---\n\n**Goal for our team (Blue = A & B):**\nWe want to reduce Red\u2019s chance of scoring correctly.\n\nThe only way to possibly mislead C would be through a **Tell(C, basket, something)**\u2014but that would cost 0.5 points and C will know you left earlier, so they\u2019ll know you can\u2019t have updated information, and they saw everything themselves. C has no reason to believe a claim from you that contradicts their direct observation.\n\n**Alternatively**, asking someone (\u201cAsk(B, basket)\u201d) would just waste 0.5 points\u2014it doesn\u2019t change anything.\n\n**So the best action is to conserve points** because we can\u2019t affect what C knows\u2014they already know the true answer.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal move:** `Pass`",

B puts a stapler in the basket.  \n     \u2192 basket = stapler  \n  2. D puts an apple in the bag.  \n     \u2192 bag = apple, basket = stapler  \n  3.

D moves the apple from the bag to the box.  \n     \u2192 bag = empty, box = apple, basket = stapler  \n  6. You leave the room after that. (No further changes are visible to you after you leave.)\n\nEveryone was present for all of that, except after step 6, if anything else happened (we\u2019re not told anything else), you wouldn\u2019t know.  \nThere\u2019s no mention of anyone else entering after you leave, so the scene ends there.  \n\nTherefore, **at the end of the scenario:**\n- bag = empty  \n- box = apple  \n- basket = stapler  \n\n**Question that will be asked:**  \nC will be asked *\u201cwhat is in the basket?\u201d*\n\nC was in the room for all the events, so C actually knows perfectly that the basket contains the stapler.  \nC will answer \u201cstapler,\u201d so Red will gain 1 point unless we find a way to weaken their certainty.\n\n**Action phase (your turn):**\nYou can choose:\n- **Ask(...)** \u2014 costs 0.5 points; doesn\u2019t influence the Red team directly here.  \n- **Tell(...)** \u2014 costs 0.5 points; can try to mislead them.  \n- **Pass** \u2014 costs 0 points but lets the Red team likely score +1 because C surely knows the answer already.\n\nSo it might be strategically best to **Tell C** something false about the basket, hoping to confuse C (a Red teammate).  \nThat can make C answer incorrectly in the next phase, costing Red 1 point.  \nThe cost to Blue = 0.5 points, but if C answers wrong, the Red team loses 1 point \u2014 net swing of +1.5 in Blue\u2019s favor.  \n\n**Best move:**  \nTell(C, Basket, Apple) \u2014 a plausible lie (since apple has been moved around).

So you know everything that happened.  \n- **B**: Left the room before D moved objects, so B *last saw* the banana in the basket and an apple in the bag.

But since no information was given that anyone re\u2011entered or left after them until \u201cD moves\u2026\u201d, it\u2019s more likely they\u2019ll assume no one changed it.\n\nIf we do a **Tell** action to B (\u201cTell(B, basket, banana)\u201d), that would cost us 0.5 points but ensure B says \u201cbanana.\u201d Given that B is already likely to give the correct answer without prompting, the rational choice is to **save the 0.5 points** and avoid unnecessary cost.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:**  \n**Pass**",

Let's double check:\n  - C left *after* putting apple back in box.\n  - After C left, D moved apple to bag, stapler in box.  \n  So C believes the apple is in the box, not knowing D\u2019s last moves.\n- **D:** Knows the true state (apple in bag, stapler in box).\n\n### Question\n> I am going to ask **B** what is in **the box**.\n\nThe Blue team (you and B) scores if B says \u201cstapler\u201d (correct). They lose points if B says otherwise (e.g., \u201capple\u201d).\n\n### What can we do\nIn the action phase, you can:\n- **Tell(B, Box, Stapler)** \u2192 costs 0.5 points, but ensures your teammate knows the true answer and can answer correctly.  \n- **Ask someone** \u2014 pointless here, since you already have perfect information.  \n- **Pass** \u2192 costs 0 and B will answer \u201capple\u201d \u2192 wrong \u2192 Blue\u202f\u20131 point.\n\nSo spending 0.5 points to gain +1 point = net +0.5 expected; passing gives \u22121 \u2192 net \u22121. Clearly it\u2019s worth telling.\n\n\u2705 **Best move:** Tell(B, Box, Stapler)\n\n**Your action:** `Tell(B, Box, Stapler)`",

When B reentered after C, it\u2019s possible C changed something while alone, but B would have seen any new actions while B was inside that time.\n- **C**: Was alone in the room for a period and could have changed things, but we are not told they did \u2014 so it\u2019s *possible but not certain* that the bag\u2019s contents changed.\n- **D**: Never reentered after leaving, irrelevant.\n\nAt the end, the only uncertainty is whether **C** changed what\u2019s in the bag when alone.\n\nYou are about to be asked what\u2019s in the bag \u2014 but **no**, B will be asked.  \nB\u2019s answer will determine points, not yours.\n\nYou can:  \n- **Ask C or B** for info (costly).  \n- **Tell B** what\u2019s in the bag (maybe help your teammate).  \n- **Pass** (costs nothing).\n\n**Goal:** Maximize Blue\u2019s chance of scoring.\n\nCurrently, because you don\u2019t know if C swapped the contents, it\u2019s risky to assert anything. But **maybe B knows** if C interacted with the bag while B was in the room. B could be uncertain too\u2014but since B reentered after C and then left again, any change C might have made before B entered is unknown to B. C could have reverted, but nothing is guaranteed.\n\nHowever, if no one saw any mention of \u201cC placing or removing anything,\u201d the most likely assumption (in standard deduction puzzles) is that unmentioned actions did *not* occur. So the bag likely *still contains the banana*.\n\nSince you *know* that, but B may or may not, telling B could help them.  \nBut telling costs 0.5 points, and B might already know the bag contains the banana.  \nLet\u2019s check B\u2019s probable knowledge:\n- B saw you put banana in bag.  \n- B left, C left, C entered, B entered, B left. During B\u2019s reentry, if C did not change anything while alone (and nothing said that they did), B still knows it\u2019s banana. So B already has correct info.\n\nTherefore **telling** B would *cost 0.5* with no improvement, and **asking** anyone costs 0.5 and doesn\u2019t help because you already know enough.\n\n**Optimal action:**  \n\u2705 **Pass**\n\n**Final answer:**  \n**Pass**",

So, you know final state exactly.\n- **B** left early and hasn\u2019t reentered, so B doesn\u2019t know anything after that; B knows bag=brick before leaving, but doesn\u2019t know subsequent events.\n- **C** was in room until now, so C saw all actions after D left \u2014 including your moves \u2014 so C also knows the final state.\n- **D** left before your last several moves, so D does **not** know that you and C moved items after that point. The last D saw:  \n   - Bag had ball (from C\u2019s action).  \n   - Box had brick (from D\u2019s earlier move).  \n   - Basket empty.  \n\nSo D thinks final state:\n- Bag = ball  \n- Box = brick  \n- Basket = empty  \n\nThat\u2019s *actually identical* to the true state except later you and C swapped the brick around and back to basket=brick \u2014 so D is *wrong* about the brick\u2019s final location (D believes it's still in box).\n\nNow, the question that will be asked is: **\"D, what is in the bag?\"**  \nD last saw C put a ball in the bag and nothing since; D has no reason to suspect changes to the bag (and indeed, the bag remained containing the ball).  \nSo D will likely answer \"ball\" \u2014 which is **correct.**\n\nSince D will answer correctly (and Red team would get +1 point), **our goal** is to prevent that if possible or reduce their chance of being correct.\n\nWe can act only once: Ask, Tell, or Pass.\n\nLet\u2019s consider options:\n\n- **Ask**: irrelevant; that just gives us info; costs us points (\u22120.5). Our action doesn't affect D\u2019s answer in general.\n- **Tell**: We could tell D a false statement to mislead D about the contents.  \n  Example: Tell(D, bag, brick). This might make D doubt or trust us. If D believes us, D might answer incorrectly (\"brick\") \u2192 that makes Red lose 1 point.  \n  Since D is our opponent, we *want D to be wrong*.\n  Therefore, the optimal move is to **try to mislead D** into the wrong answer.\n\nBecause D trusts their last memory (bag=ball), but we could send a contradicting message to confuse them.\n\nThe best possible payoff (if D believes us) is +0 for us (cost 0.5 points for the Tell action) plus D incorrectly answers (Red \u22121).  \nThat\u2019s effectively a swing of +0.5 net compared to doing nothing (Pass \u2192 D correct \u2192 Red +1).\n\nSo expected value is good if there\u2019s any chance D believes us. Since communications are private, no drawback except \u22120.5 cost.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:** Tell(D, bag, brick)  \n\n(We lie, to induce D to answer incorrectly that the bag contains a brick.)  \n\n**Final answer:**\n> Tell(D, bag, brick)",

So D will answer correctly, earning **+1 point for the Red team**.  \n\n---\n\n**Goal:** prevent Red from scoring, or score ourselves.  \n\nWe can act: Ask, Tell, Pass.\n\nBecause D is answering, we could use our action to mislead D.  \nWe could **Tell(D, bag, brick)** \u2014 a lie \u2014 so D will think the brick is in the bag and will answer \u201cbrick,\u201d which would be **wrong** (since bag has the ball). That would get Red **\u20131 point**, and help us.\n\nCost: 0.5 points to us \u2192 Net for us = +1 (= we hurt them by 1 full point, but pay 0.5) \u2192 Net +0.5 relative gain.\n\nSo the best move is to **Tell(D, bag, brick)**.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Final Answer:**\n**Tell(D, bag, brick)**",

That\u2019s better for Blue.\n- **Ask(...)** actions right now don\u2019t make sense; we already know everything, and it costs us points.\n\n---\n\n### Optimal action\n\nBest move for Blue: **Tell C a false answer**, so that C is more likely to answer incorrectly.  \nC trusts what he hears because C can\u2019t verify the current state.\n\nWe should make C believe the **box does not have the brick**.\n\nSo the optimal action is:  \n**Tell(C, box, orange).**\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Your action:**  \n**Tell(C, box, orange)**",

You (A) **move the apple from the basket to the bag.**  \n   - Basket becomes empty, bag now has the apple. (C is unaware of this.)\n\n4.

You **move the apple from the bag to the box.**  \n   - Bag empty, box = apple, basket = ball  \n\n7. **D moves the apple from the box to the bag.**  \n   - So final internal reality:  \n     bag = apple  \n     box = empty  \n     basket = ball  \n\n---\n\n### What does C know?\n\nC left after seeing D put the apple in the basket.

No, because D (Red) will likely answer incorrectly without our intervention.\n\nHowever, if we Ask or Tell someone, it costs us 0.5 points.  \nOur current team score is 0, Red=0.\nIf we Pass, we spend no points, and D will likely answer wrong (since they don\u2019t know the later actions).  \nRed loses 1 point, we gain +0 relative advantage.\n\nSo the **optimal move** is to do nothing that costs points.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal Action:** `Pass`",

We don\u2019t want to give away information that helps him.  \n- There\u2019s no gain in asking anyone, because:\n  - You already know the truth (banana in box).\n  - It costs 0.5 points to ask or tell.  \n\nIf D is asked, Red can earn +1 if correct; -1 if wrong.  \nIf we could somehow cause D to *answer incorrectly*, that helps Blue (+1 differential).  \n\nSo can we make D believe something incorrect?  \nPossibly by **Tell(D, Box, SomethingElse)** \u2014 but that costs 0.5 points.  \n\nWould it trick D?  \nLet\u2019s check what D knows: he *saw* the banana go into the box as the last action he witnessed. Hard to deceive him; he saw it. But if we tell him something conflicting while outside action phase messages are private, he might second-guess his own memory? It\u2019s unlikely the game models \u201cconfusion\u201d; he can reason logically, so telling him a lie won\u2019t help\u2014he knows what he saw most recently.  \n\nThus, **best move is to Pass** \u2014 do not waste points.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:**\n```\nPass\n```",

Therefore, **bag is empty**.  \n- Box: You just put the ball in the box right before leaving \u2192 **box has ball**.\n\n### Who knows what\n- **You**: You saw everything up to leaving; you know basket=banana, box=ball, bag=empty.\n- **B**: Stayed in the room the entire time (the narrative doesn\u2019t say they left), so B also witnessed everything \u2192 B knows the same.\n- **D**: Was in the room when:  \n  - D moved the ball from *bag to box*,  \n  - B moved the ball from *box to bag*,  \n  - you moved the ball from *bag to box* (D was still there, because D only leaves when stated\u2014and we never saw D leave).  \n  So D saw all moves too, hence D also knows the truth.  \n\nSo **D definitely knows** that the basket contains the banana.\n\n### About the question\nThey will ask **D what is in the basket.**\nD is on the *Red team*, so we want D to *answer incorrectly* if possible.  \nD will say \"banana\" unless we somehow interfere.\n\n### What we can do\nOur action options:\n- **Ask** costs points, gives us info (not needed\u2014we already know all containers).\n- **Tell** costs 0.5 points, lets us try to *mislead* D or B.\n- **Pass** costs 0 points, leaves everything unchanged.\n\nIf we want D to answer incorrectly, we could Tell(D, basket, X) with a false statement trying to convince D of wrong info.  \nBut if we tell D something, D will know the source is us (on the opposing team, Blue). D might suspect it\u2019s deception.\n\nHowever, if we told D something that sounds plausible, we could possibly confuse them.  \nLet's evaluate: D saw everything and knows for sure the basket held banana from the start and no one touched it. D\u2019s knowledge is solid\u2014our lie is unlikely to have any impact.\n\n### Strategic evaluation\nTelling anything to D wastes 0.5 points and won\u2019t change D\u2019s answer (he knows the truth).  \nAsking wastes 0.5 points for no gain.  \nTherefore, **the optimal move is to Pass.**\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action: \"Pass\"**",

You, B, C, and D start inside. Bag, box, basket all empty.  \n2. B leaves \u2192 now you, C, D inside.  \n3. D leaves \u2192 now you, C inside.  \n4. C puts a *stapler* in the basket. So the basket now has stapler.  \n5. B enters \u2192 now you, B, C inside.  \n6. D enters \u2192 now all 4 in room.  \n7. You leave \u2192 you no longer see anything that happens after this until you next enter.  \n8. B leaves (you are out, so you hear that B left).  \n9. C leaves (you are out, you hear that C left).  \n10. You enter \u2192 at this point, only D is in the room (everybody else has left).  \n    - You now see D do the following inside the room:  \n11. D moves *the orange from the basket to the bag.*  \n12. D moves *the orange from the bag to the basket.*  \n    \u2192 Wait, at this moment you see D move *an orange* from basket to bag and back.  \n\nBut, note: earlier, C had put a stapler in the basket, not an orange.  \nSo when D moves \u201cthe orange from basket to bag,\u201d it implies there was already an orange in the basket \u2014 however, *you never saw anyone put an orange in the basket.*  \n\nThat means one of two things:  \n- At some moment while you were outside, someone replaced the stapler with an orange.  \n- Or the scenario description is simply telling what you see, so when you reentered, you see D moving an orange from basket to bag \u2014 so now you *know* the object in the basket just before that was an orange (and not the stapler anymore).  \n\nThen:  \n13. D leaves.  \n14. D enters.  \n15. You leave again.  \n\nAfter that:  \n16. B enters, then leaves. (While you are outside, so you don\u2019t see anything that happens inside.)  \n\nSo last known state (from your perspective before you left):  \n- You saw D move the orange from basket \u2192 bag \u2192 basket.  \n- Then D left and then re-entered. You left while D was reentered, and possibly D did nothing else visible to you (since the scenario ends before you reenter again).  \nThus, the last thing you directly saw is **the orange being placed into the basket**.  \n\nAfter that, D left and re-entered, and B entered and left, but you did not see what they did during those times.  \n\nSo the final basket content might have changed again, but you don\u2019t know for sure.  \n- To get a certain correct answer, we\u2019d have to figure out if any other player observed what happened afterward.  \n\nTimeline after you left the room the final time:  \n- D is inside, then B enters, then B leaves.  \n\u2192 So *some events inside* could have happened that you didn\u2019t see. D might have moved something again.  \n\nThus, if you just answer now you risk being wrong if D or B swapped something after you last saw.  \n\nTo maximize points, you could either:  \n- Ask B or D what\u2019s in the basket (costs 0.5 points), perhaps get information to ensure correctness.  \n- Passing gives no cost, but you\u2019d be unsure.  \n\n**Which of B or D could know for sure?**  \n- D was there the entire end. D was there when you left at the very end. So D knows the final state.  \n- B did enter and leave, but there\u2019s no guarantee B interacted; we don\u2019t know.  \n\nTherefore, the optimal move to maximize your team\u2019s chance of scoring is:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Ask(D, basket)** \u2014 because D is the only person who definitely witnessed the final state.  \n\nSo your action:  \n**Ask(D, basket)**",

But from your perspective, that\u2019s odd\u2014**how did a banana appear?**  \n     Possibly during the time *you were outside*, someone (maybe C or D) replaced the stapler with a banana.

You know basket=ball at the end.  \n- **B** was *outside* when C moved the stapler from basket\u2192box, and *outside* when D moved stapler box\u2192basket. But **B** re-entered before the final steps.\n  - Once B entered, the visible result to B was that the stapler was currently in the basket (since D had just moved it there). \n  - B then moved stapler from basket\u2192bag and added the ball to basket. Hence, **B also knows basket=ball** at the end.\n\n- **C** left before the last few moves. C doesn\u2019t know that B changed things afterward.  \n- **D** also left before B\u2019s final modifications. D doesn\u2019t know about the ball.\n\nSo both you (A) and B know the correct final state.\n\n### Who will be asked?\n> \u201cI am going to ask B what is in the basket.\u201d\n\nSince B already knows basket has the ball, B will correctly answer \u201cball.\u201d\n\nYour options:\n\n- **Ask**: costs 0.5 points. No benefit, since you already know B will get it right.\n- **Tell(B, basket, ball)**: redundant; also costs 0.5 points.\n- **Pass**: costs 0 points.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:** **Pass** \u2014 because B already has the correct knowledge and will answer correctly.  \n\n**Your action: Pass**",

All containers (bag, box, basket) are empty.  \n2. **B leaves** \u2192 B is now outside and unaware of what happens after this.\n3. **C leaves** \u2192 C is now also outside.\n4. **You (A) put a banana in the box.**  \n   - Who sees this? Only you and D are inside the room at this point.  \n   - So **A and D** know \u201cbanana in box.\u201d  \n   - **B and C** do **not** know this.\n5. **B enters** \u2192 B re-enters, sees who is inside but cannot see the container contents. B sees A, D, and perhaps now knows C is still outside.\n6. **C enters** \u2192 Now everyone (A,B,C,D) are back in.\n7. **You (A) leave.** \u2192 Now A is outside, and the rest (B,C,D) are inside.\n8. **D leaves.** \u2192 Now B and C are inside, D and A are outside.\n9. **B leaves.** \u2192 Now C is alone inside, A,B,D outside.\n10. **B enters.** \u2192 Now C and B are inside again.\n\n---\n\n### Who knows what at this point\n- **You (A)**: know \u201cbanana in box.\u201d\n- **D**: knows \"banana in box.\"\n- **B**: never saw what you did, but could in principle have learned only if told or if someone changed the contents while they were in the room.\n- **C**: was outside when banana went in, but later spent time alone in the room. C **could** have changed contents of the box while alone.\n\nSo from your perspective, you do **not know if C changed the box\u2019s contents** when C was alone inside between steps 9 and 10.\n\nTherefore, **it is uncertain** whether the banana is still in the box.\n\n---\n\n### The question\n> \u201cI am going to ask B what is in the box.\u201d\n\nYour team wants B (your teammate) to answer correctly.  \nRight now, B may not know the current contents because C might have changed them.  \n\nYou could **Tell(B, box, banana)**, but that might be wrong if C changed it, causing your team to lose more points.\n\nYou could **Ask(C or D)** to learn what is currently in the box\u2014but that costs 0.5 points, and C or D are on opposing teams (or D is on the opposing team).  \n- B is your teammate.  \n- C and D are Red team. You probably don\u2019t want to give away information or ask them since they might lie.\n\nBest move:\n- You know the initial action (put banana in box).  \n- But since C might have altered it while alone, **you don\u2019t have reliable information about the final state**.  \n- Asking C (Red) is risky since C can lie (and probably will).\n- Asking D (Red) is also risky; D was outside when C was alone, so D may not know the current contents.\n- The only possible player who might know at the end is **C** (since they were inside alone). Asking C could give you true info, but more likely false.\n- Telling B something uncertain could get 1 or \u22121 points (plus \u22120.5 cost). Passing avoids \u22120.5 risk but leaves B uninformed, so B will likely guess incorrectly (\u22121 point).\n\nExpected value reasoning:\n- If you **Tell(B, box, banana)**, cost = \u22120.5; if banana is still in there (50% chance, say) \u2192 net +0.5; if not \u2192 net \u22121.5. Expected maybe \u2248 \u22120.5 \u2192 not good.\n- **Ask(C, box)**: cost \u22120.5, maybe 50% chance of truth, uncertain.\n- **Pass**: cost 0, but B likely guesses wrong (\u22121 point upcoming).\n\nSince C might *definitely* have had time to change the box, and you have no evidence to the contrary, the safest play might be to **ask** C directly\u2014getting some signal. Even though C might lie, you can still decide what you believe before B answers. Currently, however, you cannot inform B again (you only have one action this turn). So the Ask is partly information gathering for future turns.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action now:**  \n**Ask(C, box)** \u2014 it's the only way to update your knowledge about whether your earlier action still holds.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n> Ask(C, box)",

B leaves.\n- Question: The host will ask **B what is in the bag.**\n\n**What B knows:**\n- B was in the room at first, so B saw D put the ball in the bag.\n- Then B leaves (after you).\n- After that (when B is outside): D leaves, then D re-enters, then B re-enters, then B leaves.\n  - So when B re-enters, D is already in the room and might have done something inside before B arrived.\n  - When B re-enters, B sees whatever is in view at that moment\u2014but cannot see inside containers.\n  - B leaves again.\n\nSo after this, B *could* be uncertain whether D changed what was in the bag when D re-entered alone.\n\n**What you know that B does NOT know:**\n- You do not know what happened while you were outside before D left (since you left early). So you missed anything after the initial \"D puts ball in bag\".  \n  Except we are told no other described actions occurred (but there could have been undisclosed ones).\nSo, you don't actually have any *certain information beyond what B already saw.*  \nThe scenario text fully describes your knowledge\u2014there\u2019s no mention of any further actions to you\u2014so there\u2019s no hidden moves for you.\n\nTherefore, you have **no definite new information about the bag** compared to B. Any Tell or Ask would cost points and not gain clarity.\n\n**Strategic choice:**\n- The host will ask **B** what\u2019s in the bag.\n- You want Blue to answer correctly.\n- However, you don\u2019t know if D changed the contents.\n- You could **Ask B** what\u2019s in the bag (cost 0.5) \u2192 you\u2019d get B\u2019s opinion (doesn\u2019t help B).\n- Or **Tell B** \u201cThere is a ball in the bag\u201d (cost 0.5) \u2014 it could help B if it\u2019s true.\n- But you don\u2019t know that it\u2019s still true for sure.\n- Telling might help your teammate guess correctly if you believe D didn\u2019t change it.\n\nGiven the narrative, it's likely D never changed anything, as that *would have been described to you if it happened while you were inside*, but after you left, D could have changed it without that being described to you. However, the puzzle usually hides uncertainty, but since no one explicitly changed the bag contents after D put the ball, the most straightforward assumption is that bag still has the ball.\n\nSo, **if we assume no hidden changes**, telling B \u201cbag has ball\u201d helps B answer correctly (cost 0.5, gain 1 = net +0.5 expected).\n\nIf we **pass**, we save 0.5 but B might answer randomly (risk \u00b11).\n\nSo **optimal action** is:\n\n\u2705 **Tell(B, Bag, Ball)**",

Now inside are A and D only.\n\n**Final reality:**  \n- box = stapler  \n- bag = empty  \n- basket = banana  \n\n**Who knows what:**  \n- A knows everything (was never out of the room): knows box=stapler.  \n- B also knows what happened until they left, so B knows final box=stapler (they were in the room when they did it).  \n- D knows everything as well, also box=stapler.  \n- C left early and missed steps 3\u20137. When C left, the situation was box=stapler (since that\u2019s when C left right after you put in the stapler). Since C hasn\u2019t seen any later moves, C *believes* box=stapler.  \n\nSo interestingly, **C\u2019s belief matches reality** by coincidence!  \n\nThe question: *I am going to ask C what is in the box.*  \n\u2192 If asked, C will (assuming rational accuracy) answer \u201cstapler.\u201d  \nThat would be **correct** and Red team scores +1.  \n\nWe want Blue team to win, so we prefer C to give a *wrong* answer. That means we\u2019d like to confuse C before the question\u2014perhaps through a Tell (lying to C).  \n\n**Possible actions:**  \n- **Pass:** do nothing \u2192 C likely says \u201cstapler\u201d (correct) \u2192 +1 Red. Bad for Blue.  \n- **Tell(C, Box, something false)** costs 0.5, but if we can make C answer incorrectly, we make Red lose 1 (net +0.5 for Blue overall). Good move.

There\u2019s no mention of any communication restrictions except that other players don\u2019t overhear.\n\nIf we do nothing, C simply answers correctly, Red +1 pt.\nIf we intervene:  \n- We could try a **Tell(C, basket, something incorrect)** like `\"Tell(C, basket, orange)\"`.  \n  - That would *cost* us 0.5 points but might cause C to doubt or to \u201cbelieve\u201d our message.  \n  - Since lying is allowed, this might successfully confuse C and cause Red -1 point, if C trusts us even slightly.  \n  - Expected value: If there's a chance C is convinced, it\u2019s probably worth the half point. If C completely disbelieves you (since you left the room and C knows that), it might have no benefit.  \n\nBut note: C *knows you were in the room*. C saw you leave *before B left*, so C knows exactly what happened when you were still inside \u2014 you saw D put banana in basket and orange in box. If you send a misleading message, C might suspect deception, but sometimes players rely on messages that seem consistent with prior info.\n\nStill, in rational play: C would know you saw what C did; so C knows you\u2019re just trying to mislead. C would ignore you. A Tell harms us by -0.5 with no benefit.\n\nSimilarly, using Ask wastes points.\n\n### Optimal play under rational assumptions:\nAssume all players are logical and know that you gain nothing from giving truthful information to an opponent.

You (A) are now outside.\n- Then **B leaves**. Now only C and D are inside at the end.\n\nSo final positions:\n- C and D are inside the room at the end.\n- A and B are outside.\n\n**Now, what does each know?**\n- C saw: basket empty initially \u2192 apple put into basket \u2192 left room \u2192 reentered \u2192 saw D move the apple from bag \u2192 basket.  \nSo C knows that currently there is an **apple in the basket**.\n\n**Question to be asked:**  \n\u201cI am going to ask **C** what is in the basket.\u201d  \n\nC **knows** the correct answer: apple.

C is Red team, so if C answers wrong, Blue scores +0 (since Red gets -1).\n\nA Tell action could do that. But note: C is in the room with D right now. You can still *Tell* C something false \u2014 e.g., Tell(C, Basket, Empty). That might persuade C if trust relationships exist or if we assume they believe you \u2014 but since no such trust dynamic is specified, and C saw with their own eyes that the apple was in the basket, they have direct information. It\u2019s unlikely any message from A (who is outside) would override that unless deception mechanics are assumed with equal credibility. Since A\u2019s instruction costs 0.5 points, and C already knows the true answer, there is no strategic benefit to spending points \u2014 they are almost certain to be right.\n\nSo, **optimal move**:  \nThere\u2019s no advantage to spending 0.5 points, as C will answer correctly regardless.\n\n\u2705 **Best action: Pass**\n\n**Your action:** `Pass`",

B moved **brick** from **basket** to **box** \u2192 **box** has **brick**, **basket** empty.  \n  5. You then **left the room**.  \n  6. No further described events occurred.\n\nSo **when you leave**, the **bag** still has the **ball**, and everyone inside the room (B and C) has seen this sequence.\n\n### What the game master will do:\nThey will ask **C** (from the Red team) **what is in the bag**.\n\nC knows:  \n- You put the ball in the bag.  \n- No one moved anything from the bag afterwards.  \nSo C (truthfully) knows the bag contains the ball. But since C is on the **opposing team**, C will probably try to lie to reduce Blue\u2019s chance of scoring (or at least create misinformation, if asked later).\n\nHowever, the question is being asked **to C**, not you. The answer phase grants or subtracts points based on the **team whose player is being asked**.\n\nSince **C (Red)** will be asked, if they answer **correctly**, **Red team +1**; if **incorrectly**, **Red team \u22121**.\n\n### Your goal:\nYou are on **Blue team**, so we want **Red** to answer **incorrectly**.\n\nCan we influence that?  \nYou can:\n- **Ask** someone a question (costs 0.5 points)\n- **Tell** someone something (costs 0.5 points)\n- **Pass** (costs 0 points)\n\nYou might try to **mislead** C, since they\u2019re about to give a critical answer.\n\nRight now, you *can* take an action that might affect what C believes. For example:\n\n- **Tell(C, bag, brick)** \u2192 C hears you tell them \"bag has brick\".  \n  They might believe you and answer \u201cbrick\u201d \u2192 **wrong** \u2192 Red \u22121 point.  \n  That costs your team **0.5 points**, but nets effectively **+1 point swing** (+1 Blue relative to theirs because Red loses 1).  \n  That\u2019s beneficial.\n\nAlternatively:\n- **Pass** \u2192 costs 0 points, but Red might answer \u201cball\u201d correctly \u2192 Red +1 \u2192 that\u2019s bad.\n\nSo the **optimal action** is to use that small cost (0.5 points) to mislead the opposing team.\n\n\u2705 **Best action**: `Tell(C, bag, brick)`\n\nThis way, if C believes you, Red\u2019s answer will be wrong, netting a +0.5 relative advantage (they lose 1, you lose 0.5).

So C *already knows* exactly what\u2019s in the bag (the ball).  \n\nNo one changed anything after you left (not described). Therefore, C\u2019s knowledge is accurate.\n\n**Question:** The host will ask **C what is in the bag.**  \nFor our team (Blue: you and B) to score, we want C (Red team) to answer *incorrectly*.  \n\nBut right now C knows correctly that the bag contains the ball. Unless someone misleads C, they\u2019ll answer correctly, giving Red +1 point.\n\nC trusts things they see (you're gone), but if B (who is still in the room) told C that something else was in the bag, C might be misled. However, our turn is your action\u2014*you* can Ask, Tell, or Pass.  \nYou\u2019re outside the room now, so you could contact B privately\u2014we can use that to coordinate Blue\u2019s deception.\n\nSince it costs points to communicate, we only spend communication if it increases our expected score.  \n\nYou know the truth. B also knows the truth. But B might want to trick C. You don\u2019t need to ask anything now\u2014you already know what\u2019s where. You don\u2019t need to tell B anything\u2014they already saw everything too. B might mislead C directly on their turn, since B is still inside the room.\n\nHence, **the optimal action** is:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Pass**\n\nSave the 0.5 points and let B mislead C in their turn.\n\n**Final answer:**  \n`Pass`",

All 4 start in the room \u2014 everything empty.\n2. B leaves.\n3. C leaves.\n4. You (A) put stapler in basket.  \n   - Now basket = stapler; bag empty; box empty.\n5. You leave.\n6. You enter again (so you re-enter before D\u2019s moves).\n7. D moves stapler from basket \u2192 bag.\n8. D moves stapler from bag \u2192 basket.\n9. D leaves.\n10. D enters.\n11. You leave.\n12. B enters.\n13. B leaves.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: What are you aware of?\n- You are in the room for steps 1\u20134, 6\u20139.  \n- You are **not** in the room for steps 5 (you left), and 10\u201313 (you\u2019d left before D entered again and stayed out).\n- When you are inside, you see all actions that occur in the room.  \n\nAt the moment before you leave in step 9, you see D move stapler from basket \u2192 bag and then from bag \u2192 basket.  \nThus, the last thing you saw before leaving was: **stapler back in basket**.\n\nAfter you left:\n- D left and re-entered, but you were outside.\n- D possibly did something after re-entering\u2014but no actions described after his re-entry, so no further movement mentioned.\n\nRemember: when you are outside, you **don\u2019t** see the actions inside. However, the scenario description says everything that happens; if no further movement is described, it means nothing else occurred. It explicitly noted D enters again \u2014 that\u2019s the last action before you leave, B enters, B leaves. It did **not** say D touched any containers again after re-entering.\n\nSo final known state from the sequence is *stapler in basket*, and no moves after D re-entered are listed.  \nThus, **basket = stapler**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: What information could B have?\nB was outside most of the time and only entered at the very end. No objects moved while B was inside (since no movement after D re-entered is described).  \nSo B **does not know** any contents from observation; if you were to ask them, they'd have to guess or rely on your telling.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: What about the Red team?\nC saw your early placement but left before D\u2019s moves. D knows current state. You already know it as well. So no advantage to Ask them.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Optimal Action\nSince you already **know exactly** what\u2019s in the basket, and there\u2019s no uncertainty, asking or telling would only cost your team 0.5 points without benefit.  \nThe answer phase\u2019s question (\u201cI am going to ask you what is in the basket\u201d) is already directed to you, so communication wouldn\u2019t help your teammate earn points this turn.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is to **Pass**.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Your action:** `Pass`",

B leaves the room.  \n3. D moves banana from **box \u2192 bag**.  \n4. C puts **ball** in **box**.  \n5. C leaves the room.  \n6. You move banana from **bag \u2192 basket**.  \n7. D moves banana from **basket \u2192 bag**.  \n8. You move banana from **bag \u2192 basket**.\n\nFinal positions (truth):  \n- **Box**: ball  \n- **Bag**: empty  \n- **Basket**: banana  \n\nPlayers\u2019 knowledge states:  \n- **B** left the room very early (after step 2), so B saw banana go in box, but nothing after that \u2192 B *believes banana is in box*.  \n- **C** left after step 5 (after putting ball in box), so C saw banana in bag at that point (step 3), ball in box, banana in bag \u2192 C *believes banana in bag, ball in box*.  \n- **D** saw everything (D never left), so D knows final: banana in basket, ball in box.  \n- **You (A)** also saw everything, so you know truth: box=ball, basket=banana.\n\nThe question will ask **C what is in the box**.  \nC believes banana was moved from box \u2192 bag (by D) and never saw the banana move again; C also put a ball in the box afterward. So C will think **box = ball**, which matches the truth.  \n\nThus, if C answers honestly, C will give the correct answer, and the red team (C\u2019s team) will score +1 point.  \n\nYour goal: make the *blue team* win. Ideally, you want to make red lose a point or at least prevent them from gaining one.  \n\nYou can spend 0.5 points to **Tell** or **Ask** privately.  \nYou could lie to C to make them answer incorrectly. For example: you can Tell(C, Box, Banana). C would then believe you (maybe) and answer \"banana\". Then C would be wrong and red would lose 1 point.  \n\nThat would cost your team 0.5 points but red would lose 1 point \u2192 net benefit to you +0.5 relative.  \n\nSo best strategic move = **Tell(C, Box, Banana)** (deceptive move).  \n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:** `Tell(C, Box, Banana)`",

D saw every event. Therefore, D knows **basket = ball**.  \n\nSo, **D can answer correctly** unless D chooses to lie.\n\n### Our strategic goal\nWe (Blue team: A and B) want to maximize our team\u2019s points.  \n- Red team: C and D.\nSo if D (Red) answers correctly, Red +1 point.  \nIf D answers incorrectly, Red \u22121 point.  \n\nCurrently, both teams have 0 points.  \nWe would prefer D to be *wrong*.\n\n### What can we do?\nYou (A) can take one action:\n\n- **Ask** someone \u2014 costs \u22120.5 Blue points.  \n- **Tell** someone \u2014 costs \u22120.5 Blue points.  \n- **Pass** \u2014 costs 0.\n\nBecause D already **knows the true content** (basket = ball), the only way we can influence D is by *feeding D false information* and hoping D believes it.\n\nNow, remember:\n- We can **Tell(D, basket, brick)** (trying to deceive D). That costs us \u22120.5 points.\n- If D falls for it and answers \u201cbrick,\u201d Red will lose 1 point (net +0.5 advantage to us).\n- If D doesn\u2019t believe us, we lose 0.5 points for no gain.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how \u201cD\u201d behaves, but since in this game, deception and deduction are central, a plausible optimal play for a rational D might be to distrust us (since we\u2019re on the opposite team).  \nHowever, if we do nothing (Pass), D will surely answer \u201cball\u201d (correct) \u2192 Red +1 point.  \nThat\u2019s worse for us.\n\nSo we must try to induce an error even at a \u22120.5 cost, because worst case, Red +1 if we do nothing; best case, Red \u22121 if deception works.\n\nExpected value reasoning:\n- If we **do nothing**, expected Red gain = +1.0 (worst for us).\n- If we **Tell(D, basket, brick)**:\n    - If D believes us, Red \u22121 \u2192 relative gain +1.5 to us (since we paid \u22120.5 to cause \u22121 to Red).\n    - If D doesn\u2019t believe us, Red +1 \u2192 relative loss \u22121.5 for us vs. final 0.5 cost only, so not ideal.\nBut since we must choose something, *we want at least the chance to influence D.*\n\n**Therefore, the optimal move is to attempt to deceive D** by telling a plausible but false statement.\n\n### \u2705 Optimal Action:\n\n**Tell(D, basket, brick)**\n\n*(Try to make D think the basket still contains the brick.)*",

Still, our best bet is to **deceive D** to lower the Red team's chance of answering correctly.\n\n---\n\n### Best strategic action\nWe should **tell D** wrong information about the basket\u2019s contents.\n\nFor instance:\n\n`Tell(D, Basket, Brick)`\n\nBecause if D believes us and answers \u201cbrick\u201d instead of \u201cball,\u201d Red will lose 1 point instead of gaining 1 point, netting Blue a 1-point advantage (minus our 0.5 cost = +0.5 net improvement).\n\nPassing causes no change, but allows D to answer correctly, giving Red +1 full point.  \nSo **lying to D** is the best move.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Optimal Action:**\n```\nTell(D, Basket, Brick)\n```",

D might be cautious but could fall for it.\n\nIf we tell D \"banana\", D might recall he personally moved banana away and C put a ball \u2014 he knows that. He will almost certainly disbelieve that.  \nIf we tell \"empty\", at least there\u2019s a small uncertainty if C removed it? But D saw C put ball in, then nothing after that while D was in room. Since D remained in room until end of scenario description (we never saw him leave again), D is still present during \u201cYou leave\u201d and after, but you leaving does not cause further object changes \u2014 unless B changed something, but D saw B enter and leave but could confirm no change? The rules say: anyone inside the room sees anything happening in the room. So if B entered, D saw it. Thus D knows B found the ball still there. So D knows basket still has ball. So it\u2019s very unlikely we can trick him.\n\nThus, any **Tell(D, \u2026)** will not make him believe false. But Telling him the true content (\u201cball\u201d) also gives no benefit (he\u2019d already answer correctly).\n\nTherefore, best is to **Pass**, saving 0.5 points, since we can\u2019t change the outcome.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal Action:** `Pass`",

B puts **ball** in the **basket** \u2014 you and C both see this.  \n   Basket = ball.\n3. B puts **brick** in the **box** \u2014 you and C both see this.  \n   Box = brick; Basket = ball.\n4. D enters the room \u2014 all three of you present see that.\n5. D leaves the room \u2014 everyone sees that.\n6. D enters again \u2014 everyone in the room (B, C) sees, but you also learn D enters (since you\u2019re still there at that moment).\n7. Then **you leave the room** \u2014 so at the end, **B, C, and D are inside.**\n\nNow, you no longer see what happens after you leave. The only possible source of uncertainty is whether something changed after your departure. You don\u2019t know if D or anyone moved the ball from its basket.\n\nThe question will be **ask C what\u2019s in the basket**. You want C to answer correctly, because Blue team (you and B) get points if C answers wrongly (since C is on Red) \u2014 right now your goal is to make C get it wrong.\n\nSo:  \n- When you were present, Basket = ball.\n- After you left, something could have changed, but you didn\u2019t see it.\n- You want C to be misled so that C gives an *incorrect* answer.\n\nYou could **Tell C** something false (since this is your only communication opportunity).  \nIf you tell C an incorrect guess (because you can speak now), you might cause C to give a wrong answer, and Blue gains a point.\n\nThus your best move is to **Tell(C, Basket, Brick)** (for example), which costs your team 0.5 points, but potentially gains 1 point if C\u2019s answer is wrong (a net gain of +0.5).\n\nThat is **better than passing**, because passing costs 0 but risks C answering correctly.\n\n**Optimal action:**  \n`Tell(C, Basket, Brick)`.",

      "action": "Let's reason carefully step by step:\n\n### What we know:\n- Players:  \n  - Blue Team: **A (you)** and **B**  \n  - Red Team: **C** and **D**\n- Containers: bag, box, basket.\n- Initial: all empty.\n- You, B, and C are in the room at the start.  \n  \u2192 So A, B, and C see everything happening until one leaves.\n\n**Events:**\n1. B puts a **ball** in the **basket**.  \n   (Seen by you, B, and C.)\n2. B puts a **stapler** in the **box**.  \n   (Seen by you, B, and C.)\n3. D enters the room.  \n   (Now A, B, C, D all see.)\n4. D leaves the room.  \n   (Now A, B, C remain again.)\n5. D enters the room again.  \n   (Now A, B, C, D all see.)\n6. Then **you leave the room**.  \n   (You do not see afterward.)\n\nSo \u2014 crucially \u2014 before you leave, *no one has changed what's in the basket*.  \nBasket contained the ball, and nothing else was ever mentioned.\n\nAfter you leave, something might happen, but you are not told.  \nHowever, it might or might not matter, since you are told:  \n> I am going to ask C what is in the basket.\n\nC was in the room the *whole time,* so C saw everything that happened.  \nTherefore, C knows exactly the basket\u2019s contents.\n\n### Your objective\nYour team (Blue) gains or loses points depending on C\u2019s final answer for the basket question.\n\nYou can act once. Actions cost as follows:\n- Ask or Tell: costs Blue 0.5 points.\n- Pass: costs nothing.\n\nBut C is on the other team (Red). If you make C know the correct answer, that *helps the opponents.*  \nIf C already knows, telling lies or misleading maybe reduces Red\u2019s chance.\n\nSince C saw all room events including B\u2019s actions, after D\u2019s activities (and before you left), C still knows the truth unless something changed after your departure. But you don\u2019t know that.\n\nNow, if we tell C anything, we could potentially mislead them\u2014but since you're not in communication with C after leaving, your Tell action can reach them (since Tells are private and independent of physical presence in \"room\"). But it costs 0.5 points, and since you don't know if Red already might be wrong (if D or B changed something after you left), the safe play is usually **to do nothing** \u2014 because if Red must make a guess, you don\u2019t want to risk giving them correct info or paying a cost for possibly irrelevant deception.\n\n### Rational choice:\n- The opponent (C) has full or nearly full information.  \n- Any Ask/Tell costs points.  \n- You can\u2019t improve your team\u2019s chance by spending points now, since C probably already knows the basket holds a ball.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action: Pass.**\n\n---\n\n**Your action:** `Pass`",

D leaves (you see this).\n2. B leaves (you see this).\n3. C puts an apple in the box \u2192 you see this (you\u2019re still inside).  \n   \u2192 **So box now contains an apple.**\n4. B enters (you see this).\n5. D enters (you see this).\n6. You leave \u2192 stop seeing what happens next.\n7. B leaves (you are outside, but you know B leaves).\n8. C leaves (you are outside; you know C leaves).\n9. You enter (now you\u2019re back inside).\n\nWhen you reenter, only D is still in the room (since B and C have left). At this point you did **not** see what happened while you were outside.\n\nAfter you reenter:\n10. D moves *the stapler* from the box to the basket.  \n   (You see this since you\u2019re inside.)\n   \u2192 This suggests the box contained a stapler at that moment. But you didn\u2019t see anyone put a stapler there, so something must have changed while you were out!  \n   \u2192 After this, box is empty, basket has stapler.\n11. D moves stapler from basket back to box. You see this.  \n   \u2192 Box = stapler again.\n12. D leaves.\n13. D enters.\n14. You leave (you can no longer see).\n15. B enters.\n16. B leaves.\n\n**Your last known information at the moment you left (step 14):**\n\u2013 Box contained the stapler.  \n\u2013 You have no knowledge of further changes (you were away when B entered/leaves).  \n\nSince D left-then-entered after moving stapler, D may have changed something during step 13 before you left, but there\u2019s no statement that anything moved again. So as far as you know, the stapler remained in the box. B\u2019s entry may or may not have changed that, but you did not see it.\n\nNow, the **question** at the end will be: *\u201cwhat is in the box?\u201d*, and it will be asked to **you**.\n\nWe want to maximize our team\u2019s expected points.  \nWe can act now: Ask (cost .5), Tell (cost .5), or Pass (cost 0).\n\nWho might know more than you?\n\n- B was inside after you left originally (step 7\u20138 he left; 15\u201316 he entered and left after you were gone). He might have seen potential changes (if D did something in step 13 while you were outside, or if B did something in step 15).  \n- D was inside at multiple points.\n- C is outside after step 8, so knows less.\n\nTherefore, **if you\u2019re uncertain, you could Ask B or D** what\u2019s in the box.\n\nBut does anyone know for sure? After step 13, D re\u2011entered, then you left (step 14), and then B entered (step 15) and left (step 16).  \n\u2192 If D did nothing after re\u2011entering, box still has stapler.  \n\u2192 If D or later B changed it, they would know.\n\nTo secure the best chance, you could \"*Ask D, box*\" to learn what D thinks is in it (maybe D knows exactly). This costs only 0.5 and might let us answer correctly (worth +1 if correct, \u20131 if wrong).\n\n**Analysis of expected value:**\n- Without asking: Current belief = stapler in box; expected value maybe +something if confident, but there are unknown events after your observation.\n- With asking: spend \u20130.5 but gain chance of reliability; potential +1 if correct.\n\nBest action to maximize expected points \u2192 **Ask(D, box)**\n\n\u2705 **Your action:**  \n**Ask(D, box)**",

Basket now has orange.\n\n2. **B leaves the room.**  \n   \u2192 B now cannot see any further changes.\n\n3. **C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.**  \n   \u2192 You, C, D see this. Basket now empty. Bag now has orange.\n\n4. **D puts an apple in the basket.**  \n   \u2192 You, C, D see this. Basket now has apple. Bag has orange.\n\n5. **You move the orange from the bag to the box.**  \n   \u2192 You, C, D see: Bag empty, Box orange, Basket apple.\n\n6. **C moves the orange from the box to the bag.**  \n   \u2192 You, C, D see: Box empty, Bag orange, Basket apple.\n\n7. **You move the orange from the bag to the box.**  \n   \u2192 You, C, D see: Bag empty, Box orange, Basket apple.\n\nB has been outside since step 2, so B only saw up to **you putting the orange in the basket**.  \nTherefore, from B\u2019s perspective, **the basket still has the orange**.\n\nHowever, you know that now (**at the end**) the basket contains an **apple**.\n\n### The final question:\n> \u201cI am going to ask B what is in the basket.\u201d\n\nWe want B (our teammate) to answer correctly so Blue scores +1.  \nSince B has been outside, they believe the basket holds an *orange*, which is wrong.\n\nWe can take one action before the question is asked.\n\n### Possible actions:\n- **Ask(B, Basket)** \u2013 we ask B what\u2019s in the basket (cost 0.5). We learn B\u2019s belief, but that doesn't help the team directly before scoring.\n- **Tell(B, Basket, Apple)** \u2013 tell B the correct contents. This costs 0.5 points but ensures B can answer correctly (+1 point when asked).\n- **Pass** \u2013 costs 0, but then B will answer incorrectly and lose 1 point for Blue.\n\nExpected value if we **Tell**:\n+1 (correct answer) \u2013 0.5 (cost) = **+0.5 net gain**.\n\nExpected value if we **Pass**:\n\u20131 (incorrect answer) = **\u20131 net change**.\n\nSo the optimal move is to tell B the correct contents.\n\n\u2705 **Best move:**  \n**Tell(B, Basket, Apple)**",

All four start inside.\n2. D puts banana in bag.\n3. A leaves.\n4. B leaves.\n5. C leaves.\n   - After step 5, only D might still be in the room (not said that D left).\n6.

If D answers correctly, **Red gains +1 point**.  \nWe want D to answer **incorrectly** so Red loses a point.\n\nSo ideally, we should **deceive D**.\n\n### Step 4: How to make D answer incorrectly\nBecause D believes the brick is in the box, if we tell D *something false* like \u201cThe box has the stapler,\u201d D might change their answer and answer incorrectly.  \nThat would cost us 0.5 points, but if D answers incorrectly, Red loses 1 point\u2014a net gain of +0.5 for us.\n\n### Step 5: Final decision\nOptimal move:  \n**Tell(D, Box, Stapler)**\n\nThat costs our team 0.5 points, but very likely causes D to lose 1 point for their team, netting us +0.5 over them.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:**  \n**Tell(D, Box, Stapler)**",

So D\u2019s last knowledge:  \n  - Bag: contains an orange.  \n  - Box & basket: empty (since the stapler placement happened after D left).  \n\n### The question:\n> The moderator will ask D, \"What is in the bag?\"\n\nD **did** see C put the orange in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag afterward\u2014so D can correctly answer \u201corange\u201d **without any help**.\n\nTherefore, **D will definitely answer correctly**.  \nThat gives **the Red team** +1 point automatically, *unless* we interfere.  \n\nBut note \u2014 **it\u2019s not our team\u2019s question.** The question goes to a Red team member (D).  \nOur possible actions:\n- An **Ask** or **Tell** costs **0.5 points** for our Blue team.\n- Passing costs us **0 points**.\n\nCan we affect how D answers?  \nNo \u2014 D\u2019s not our teammate, so we can\u2019t directly communicate (we can only Tell or Ask *any* player, but we wouldn\u2019t want to help D).\n\nTelling D the wrong contents wouldn\u2019t help, because D already knows the truth and would likely trust their own memory. Doing an Ask/Tell wastes 0.5 points for us with no effect.\n\nSo the optimal action for Blue team is:\n\n\u2705 **Pass**\n\n\u2014 It costs nothing and there\u2019s no way to improve our standing on this turn.  \n\n**Final Answer:**\n> **Pass**",

B moves the brick from the bag \u2192 box.  \n\nFinal situation (truth):  \n- Bag: empty  \n- Basket: apple  \n- Box: brick  \n\n**What each player knows:**  \n- You and B know everything (you saw all actions).  \n- C saw up to the point when you moved the apple from the box to the basket but not what B did afterward (though yes, C was still in the room the whole time, right? Let's check: It never says C left. So C knows everything except possibly private info? No, all actions here were in the room. So C also saw everything. So A, B, and C know the box has the brick now.)  \n- D left early, knows only that a brick was placed in the box; after that D saw no changes.\n\n**Question**: D will be asked \"what is in the box.\"  \nWe want D to answer *incorrectly* since D is on the Red team.  \n\n**Our goal in the action phase:**  \nWe (Blue team) want to maximize our chance that D gives the wrong answer.

You put a **ball** in the **bag**.  \n\u2003\u2192 bag = ball.\n\n4. D moves the **ball** from **bag** to **box**.  \n\u2003\u2192 bag = \u2205, box = ball.\n\n5.

So when you leave, the last known situation is as above.\n\n---\n\nYou're told that the **question** will be:\n> \u201cI am going to ask D what is in the basket.\u201d\n\nD has been present for everything so far; D put the banana there herself and hasn\u2019t seen it moved. So D knows the basket contains a banana.\n\nThat means D will almost certainly answer \u201cbanana,\u201d which is **correct**.  \nSo the Red team (D\u2019s team) would get +1 point if nothing else happens.\n\n---\n\nOur options:\n\n- **Ask(...)**: We could ask someone about something, costs us 0.5 points. But since D knows the true answer and is not our teammate, there\u2019s no way to alter that knowledge this turn \u2014 the Ask/Tell interactions are private; D will not be influenced by our private action.\n\n- **Tell(...)**: We could tell D something false (\u201cThe basket is empty\u201d), hoping to make D answer incorrectly. But Tell costs us 0.5 points. Maybe that\u2019s good \u2014 if D *believes* us and then answers wrongly, Red loses 1 point and we lose 0.5, net +0.5 for Blue. If D doesn\u2019t believe us, we lose 0.5 for nothing.\n\nWe must consider what D knows. D SAW the banana go in the basket and no one removed it. D likely trusts her own observation more than our statement. But in general, sometimes players may take teammates' statements seriously. Since you are on the opposite team (Blue), D might *not* trust your information.\n\nIf the game allows that D is rational and aware you are her opponent, she will not believe you. Then your Tell would only cost you points.\n\nThus optimal play = **don\u2019t spend points on ineffective actions** \u2192 **Pass**.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:**  \n**Pass**",

Three empty containers: bag, box, basket.  \n- **D** puts a *stapler* in the **basket** \u2014 everyone in room (you, B, D) sees this.  \n- **D leaves the room** \u2014 outside now, unaware of future changes.  \n- **You** move *stapler* from **basket \u2192 bag**.  \n- **D** is outside, so D does **not** see this.  \n- **D enters room** \u2014 now D can see future actions, but not what happened while outside.  \n- **You** put *banana* in the **basket**. D can see that action.  \n- **You** leave the room.\n\n---\n\n### Final reality\n- bag = stapler  \n- basket = banana  \n- D **currently** in room.  \n\n---\n\n### What D knows\n- D saw: put stapler in basket (initially)\n- D then left (missing the stapler move)\n- D then reentered, saw a banana being put in basket by you.\n\nThe key is: upon reentering, D doesn\u2019t know stapler was moved out. When D saw you put a banana into basket, D might rationally think you put it *in addition* (but containers can hold one item only) \u2014 D may reason you replaced stapler? Actually, the rules say each container can hold at most one object. Because when you put banana *into basket*, D would know that means the previous item (stapler) had to be taken out first (which D didn\u2019t see). Still, D doesn\u2019t know where the stapler is; but for the upcoming question:  \n> \u201cI am going to ask D what is in the basket.\u201d\n\nSince D saw you put a banana in the basket, D\u2019s correct answer should be \u201cbanana\u201d.  \n\n---\n\n### Strategic thinking\n- Blue team (you and B): You already know D has full information to answer correctly (\u201cbanana\u201d). Thus, the Red team (the opponent of Blue) will likely earn the point if nothing changes. But we cannot directly alter D\u2019s knowledge; we can only communicate privately among players.\n\nHowever, your single action can target *any player* (including opponents). You can tell D something false about the basket to try to mislead them.  \nIf you successfully mislead D into answering incorrectly, the **Red** team loses 1 point (good for Blue). A Tell to an opponent costs us 0.5 points. Expected value analysis:  \n\n- If D currently would answer \u201cbanana\u201d (correct \u2192 +1 for Red).  \n- If you can get D to answer incorrectly, Red = \u20131, Blue = 0 (before cost).  \n- You\u2019d spend \u20130.5 for the Tell, but net swing is +1.5 for Blue compared to letting D answer right.  \n- So misleading D is beneficial if D might believe you.\n\n---\n\n### What might D believe?\nD saw you personally put the banana into the basket. Unless D thinks you are lying for some reason, telling D that the basket actually contains something else could sow doubt. The strongest misdirection would be something consistent with D\u2019s view before he left, e.g.\u202fsaying the stapler is still in the basket.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Optimal action:** Try to trick D about the basket\u2019s contents.\n\n**Action:** `Tell(D, basket, stapler)`",
