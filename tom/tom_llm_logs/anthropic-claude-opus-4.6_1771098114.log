SCENARIO

You, B, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the bag. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ...

I am going to ask you what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.

Action: Let me trace through the scenario carefully:

1. D puts a stapler in the bag. (I see this)
2. I leave the room.
3. While I'm outside, something could have happened - and indeed, when I return...
4. I enter the room.
5. D moves the stapler from the **box** to the bag.

Wait - step 5 says D moves the stapler from the **box** to the bag. This means that while I was outside the room, someone must have moved the stapler from the bag to the box. Then after I returned, D moved it from the box back to the bag.

So at the end of the scenario, the stapler is in the bag.

Since I'm being asked what is in the bag, and I'm confident the answer is the stapler, I don't need to spend points asking anyone.

Pass
A answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Action: Pass

I know what's in the bag. I put the stapler in the bag myself. While I was outside the room, B and D were still inside, so something could have changed - but I need to consider whether it's worth spending points to verify.

Actually, let me reconsider. After I left the room, B and D were in the room together, and either of them could have moved the stapler out of the bag. Then C left the room too. So I'm not 100% certain the stapler is still in the bag.

However, let me think about the sequence more carefully:
1. I put the stapler in the bag (B and C saw this, D had just entered)
2. D entered - so D also saw the room state
3. I left - B, C, and D were in the room
4. C left - B and D were in the room

B and D could have moved things after I left. But B is my teammate and would have no reason to deceive me. Let me ask B.

Ask(B, bag)
A answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. C puts a ball in the box.
2. I leave the room. (Things might happen while I'm gone that I don't know about.)
3. I enter the room. (I can now see what happens again.)
4. C moves the ball from the box to the basket. (I see this.)
5. D moves the ball from the basket to the box. (I see this.)
6. I leave the room. (Things might happen while I'm gone that I don't know about.)

So after step 5, the ball is in the box. Then I leave the room. I don't know what happened after I left.

Since I'm outside the room now and things could have changed after I left, I'm uncertain about the current contents of the box. B was in the room the entire time (the scenario never mentions B leaving), so B should know the current state of the box.

Let me ask B what's in the box. This costs 0.5 points but gives me the correct answer worth 1 point, netting 0.5 points.

Ask(B, box)
A answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the basket.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. Everyone starts in the room.
2. I put an orange in the basket - B saw this.
3. B leaves the room - after this, B doesn't see anything that happens inside.
4. D leaves the room.
5. I put a banana in the bag - B doesn't see this.
6. C moves the banana from the bag to the box - B doesn't see this.
7. I move the banana from the box to the bag - B doesn't see this.

So B saw me put an orange in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that. The basket still contains the orange.

B should know the basket contains an orange, since B saw me put it there and nothing else happened to the basket (even after B left, the basket wasn't touched).

B should be able to answer correctly: the basket contains an orange.

B answers: orange

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer "what is in the basket?"

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room when I put an orange in the basket. ✓ B knows the basket has an orange.
2. B then left the room.
3. After B left: D left, C put an apple in the bag, I moved the apple from bag to box, I moved the apple from box to bag, C moved the apple from bag to box.

The basket was never touched after I put the orange in it. So the basket still contains the orange.

B saw me put the orange in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that. B should know the basket contains an orange.

Since B already knows the correct answer (orange in the basket), there's no need to spend 0.5 points telling B.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and tell B, since B will be asked about it.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this - A, B, C, D all in room)
2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. C puts an apple in the basket. (B doesn't see this)
5. D moves the apple from the basket to the box. (B doesn't see this)
6. C moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
7. D leaves the room.

So the final state is:
- Basket: stapler
- Box: apple
- Bag: empty

B last saw the stapler being put in the basket (step 1), then left. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. So B would guess the stapler is still in the basket - which happens to be correct! The stapler was moved away but then C moved it back.

Wait, B might guess "stapler" correctly on their own since that's the last thing B saw in the basket. So I could Pass and save the 0.5 points, since B would likely answer "stapler" which is correct.

However, there's a risk that C or D might use a Tell action to mislead B before B answers. Since it's my turn now, and then other players might get turns before B answers, C or D could tell B something false about the basket.

But if I Pass, I save 0.5 points. B's natural knowledge would lead them to answer "stapler" which is correct. If an opponent tries to mislead B, that costs them 0.5 points too.

I think the safest play is to Tell B the correct answer to reinforce it, so even if an opponent tries to mislead B, B knows I (their teammate) confirmed it. But B already thinks it's the stapler, so telling them the same thing doesn't add much.

Let me Pass to save the 0.5 points, since B's default knowledge already gives the correct answer.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. All containers are empty.
2. C puts a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. I (A) move the brick from the box to the bag. (A, B, C see this)
5. I (A) put a stapler in the box. (A, B, C see this)
6. B leaves the room.
7. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (Only A and C see this)
8. I (A) move the brick from the basket to the bag. (Only A and C see this)
9. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (Only A and C see this)

So the current state is:
- Bag: empty
- Box: stapler
- Basket: brick

B's knowledge (B left after step 6):
- B last saw: bag has brick, box has stapler, basket is empty.
- B doesn't know about steps 7-9.

So B would think the box has a **stapler**, which is actually correct! The box does contain the stapler.

Since B already knows the correct answer (the box contains a stapler), I don't need to spend points telling B. I'll pass.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a brick in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the brick from the box to the bag. ... You put a stapler in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... You move the brick from the bag to the basket. ... You move the brick from the basket to the bag. ... C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. I (A) move the brick from the box to the bag. (A, B, C see this)
5. I (A) put a stapler in the box. (A, B, C see this)
6. B leaves the room.
7. I move the brick from the bag to the basket. (A, C see this)
8. I move the brick from the basket to the bag. (A, C see this)
9. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (A, C see this)

So the current state is:
- Bag: empty
- Box: stapler
- Basket: brick

B left after step 6. At that point, B knew:
- Box: stapler
- Bag: brick
- Basket: empty

B will be asked what is in the box. Based on B's knowledge, B would answer "stapler," which is actually correct! The box does contain the stapler.

So B already knows the correct answer. I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. All containers are empty.
2. C puts an apple in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. I move the apple from the box to the bag. (A, B, C see this)
5. I put a stapler in the box. (A, B, C see this)
6. B leaves the room. (At this point, B knows: bag=apple, box=stapler, basket=empty)
7. C moves the apple from the bag to the basket.
8. C moves the stapler from the box to the bag.
9. C moves the stapler from the bag to the box.

The current actual state: basket=apple, box=stapler, bag=empty.

B's last knowledge (when B left): bag=apple, box=stapler, basket=empty.

So B thinks the box has a stapler. And the box actually does have a stapler (C moved it out and back in).

So B would answer "stapler" which is correct! The answer is stapler.

Since B already knows the correct answer (the stapler is in the box, and B last saw the stapler in the box), I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

B will be asked what is in the bag. Let me trace through what B knows:

1. B was in the room and put an orange in the bag.
2. B left the room.
3. After B left: I put a banana in the box, C moved the banana from box to basket, D moved the banana from basket to box.

B doesn't know about any of the movements that happened after they left. From B's perspective, the orange is still in the bag (and indeed it is - nobody moved the orange).

So B knows the bag contains an orange, and that's correct. B should answer "orange" and get the point.

I don't need to spend points telling B something they already know.

B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

B was in the room when they put an orange in the bag. Then B left the room. After B left, various movements happened with the brick (box → basket → box → basket), but the orange was never moved from the bag.

So B knows the orange is in the bag, because B put it there and never saw anyone remove it. The orange is still in the bag.

When asked "what is in the bag?", B should correctly answer "orange" since that's what B put there and it was never moved.

Since B already knows the correct answer, there's no need for me to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
4. D moves the brick from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
5. C puts a ball in the box. (B doesn't see this)
6. D moves the ball from the box to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
7. C moves the brick from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)

Current state:
- Bag: empty
- Box: brick
- Basket: ball

B's perspective: B last saw the brick placed in the box, then left. B doesn't know what happened after. So B would think the box still contains the brick.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B.

B would likely answer "brick" based on their last knowledge - and that happens to be correct! The box currently contains the brick (C moved it back).

So if B answers "brick," Blue team gets 1 point.

However, C and D (Red team) know this too. It's currently my turn. But C and D don't get a turn before B answers - let me think about whether they could interfere.

Wait - the action phase is just my turn right now. The question will be asked to B after this action phase. C and D might also get turns before the answer phase, but the problem says "It is your turn" suggesting this is the action phase for this turn.

Since B would naturally answer "brick" (which is correct), I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B anything. B's default knowledge already leads to the correct answer.

But wait - could C or D use a Tell action to mislead B? The action phase says "It is your turn" - I need to consider if other players also get actions this turn. Looking at the rules: "each turn consists of a scenario, an action phase, and an answer phase." It seems like each player might get an action.

If C or D could Tell B something false (like "the box contains a ball"), B might be confused. But B might also not trust C or D since they're on the opposing team.

To be safe, I could Tell B the truth to reinforce their belief, but that costs 0.5 points. Since B already believes the box has a brick (correct answer), and B should be skeptical of anything C or D tell them, I think Passing is the best move.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what I should do.

**What B knows:** B was in the room when they put a banana in the bag, then B left. B doesn't know about any changes after leaving - specifically, B doesn't know that C moved the banana from the bag to the box, or that D put an orange in the bag.

So B thinks the bag still contains the banana, but actually the bag contains an orange.

**What's actually in the bag:** An orange.

Since I'm going to be asked about B's answer, and B will be asked what's in the bag, B will likely answer "banana" (which is wrong). I need to tell B the correct contents so B can answer correctly and score a point for our team.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me analyze the situation:

**What I know:**
- C put a ball in the box (everyone saw this - A, B, C, D were all present)
- D left the room
- B left the room
- After B left: C moved the ball from the box to the bag, then put a banana in the box

**What B knows:**
- B saw C put a ball in the box
- B then left the room
- B doesn't know about the subsequent moves
- So B thinks the box still contains the ball

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the box.

**The correct answer:** The box contains a **banana**.

B will likely answer "ball" because that's what B last saw in the box. That would be wrong, and Blue would get 0 points.

I should tell B what's actually in the box so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

8. I move the ball from basket to bag.
9. C moves the ball from bag to basket.

So the current state:
- **Box: banana**
- **Basket: ball**
- **Bag: empty**

B left the room after step 2, so B only saw C put a ball in the box. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. B would think the box still contains the ball.

I'm going to be asked about B's answer to "what is in the box?" - but actually, B will be asked directly. B will likely answer "ball" since that's what B last saw. The correct answer is "banana."

I need to tell B what's actually in the box so B can answer correctly and score a point for our team.

Tell(B, box, banana)
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts a ball in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. C moves the ball from the box to the bag. (Only A and C see this)
6. C puts a banana in the box. (Only A and C see this)
7. I move the ball from the bag to the basket. (Only A and C see this)
8. I move the ball from the basket to the bag. (Only A and C see this)

Current state:
- Bag: ball
- Box: banana
- Basket: empty

B's perspective: B left after seeing the ball placed in the box. B doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So B would think the box still contains the ball.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B. The correct answer is **banana**.

B would answer "ball" based on their knowledge, which is wrong. I need to tell B the correct contents of the box.

Tell(B, box, banana)
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

So the current state is:

B's perspective: B left after seeing C put an apple in the box. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B thinks the box contains an **apple**.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the box?" The correct answer is **banana**.

B will likely answer "apple" based on what they last saw, which would be wrong. My team loses a point opportunity.

I should Tell B what's actually in the box so B can answer correctly. The cost is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the bag, then left the room.
- After B left, D moved the apple from the bag to the box, and put a stapler in the bag.
- B doesn't know about these changes since B was outside the room.
- B thinks the apple is still in the bag.

**What will happen:**
- B will be asked what's in the bag.
- B believes the bag contains the apple (since B left before the swap).
- The correct answer is the stapler.
- If B answers "apple," B is wrong, and Blue gets 0 points.

**My options:**
- **Tell(B, bag, stapler):** This costs 0.5 points but would let B know the bag now contains a stapler. If B trusts me (and B should, since I'm their teammate), B answers correctly and we get 1 point. Net gain: 1 - 0.5 = +0.5 points.
- **Pass:** Costs nothing, but B will likely answer "apple" (wrong). Net gain: 0 points.

The optimal play is to Tell B the correct contents of the bag so B can answer correctly.

Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. B puts a brick in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens.)
4. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this.)
5. D moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this.)
6. D moves the brick from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this.)
7. D puts a stapler in the bag. (B doesn't see this.)

So the current state is:
- Bag: stapler
- Box: brick
- Basket: empty

B's knowledge: B last saw the brick placed in the bag, then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B would think the bag still contains the brick.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B. The correct answer is **stapler**.

B doesn't know this - B thinks the bag has a brick. If I don't tell B, B will likely answer "brick" which is wrong, and our team gets 0 points.

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer earns 1 point, so net gain is 0.5 points.

-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a stapler in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... B enters the room. ... D puts a ball in the box. ... D leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the box and whether I should help.

Let me trace through what B knows:

1. B was in the room and put a stapler in the box.
2. B left the room.
3. While B was outside: D moved the stapler from the box to the bag. (B doesn't know this)
4. B entered the room.
5. B saw D put a ball in the box. (B was present for this)
6. D left the room.

So from B's perspective:
- B put a stapler in the box initially
- B left and came back - B doesn't know what happened while away
- B saw D put a ball in the box

Now, B might think the box contains a ball (since B saw D put a ball in the box). But B might also wonder if the stapler is still there - though containers can only hold one object, so if D put a ball in the box, the box now has a ball.

Wait, but containers hold at most one object. When D put a ball in the box, what happened to whatever was in the box? From B's perspective, B thinks the stapler was still in the box when B returned (since B doesn't know D moved it). But then D put a ball in the box - since the container can only hold one object, this would displace the stapler... but actually, D had already moved the stapler out.

The actual state: The box contains a ball (D moved the stapler to the bag, then put a ball in the box).

From B's perspective: B saw D put a ball in the box. B knows containers hold at most one object. So B should conclude the box now has a ball in it (regardless of whether B thinks the stapler was still there or not, the ball replaced whatever was there).

So B should answer "ball" which is correct. I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the box.

Let me trace B's knowledge:

1. B puts an apple in the box (B knows: box has apple)
2. B leaves the room
3. C moves the apple from the box to the basket (B doesn't see this)
4. B enters the room
5. D puts a stapler in the box (B sees this - but B thought the apple was in the box, now D puts a stapler in the box. Wait, the scenario says D puts a stapler in the box. B is in the room and sees this.)
6. D leaves the room (B sees this)
7. C leaves the room (B sees this)
8. B moves the apple from the box to the bag - Wait, this is interesting. The apple is actually in the basket (C moved it there). But the scenario says "B moves the apple from the box to the bag." 

Hmm, let me re-read. The scenario says "B moves the apple from the box to the bag." But the apple was in the basket at that point (C moved it), and the stapler was in the box. This is what the scenario describes as happening though, so I need to take it at face value.

Actually wait - let me re-read more carefully. After C moved the apple to the basket, D put a stapler in the box. Then "B moves the apple from the box to the bag" - but the apple isn't in the box. Let me reconsider... Perhaps B *thought* the apple was still in the box and tried to move it, but actually moved the stapler? No, the scenario describes what actually happens.

The scenario states what actually happens: "B moves the apple from the box to the bag." This must mean B somehow moved the apple. But the apple was in the basket... This seems contradictory. Let me re-read once more.

Oh wait - maybe "B moves the apple from the box to the bag" is describing B's action from B's perspective, but actually B moved the stapler (thinking it was the apple). No, the scenario describes objective reality.

Given the scenario as stated, after everything: I put a ball in the box. So the box contains a ball.

B was present when I put the ball in the box, so B should know the box contains a ball.

B knows the box has a ball. So B should answer correctly.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

The question is: "What is in the basket?"

Let me trace what happened:
1. B puts a stapler in the basket.
2. D puts a banana in the bag.
3. C moves the banana from the bag to the box.
4. I move the banana from the box to the bag.
5. D moves the banana from the bag to the box.

Everyone (A, B, C, D) was in the room the entire time, so everyone saw everything.

B knows that the stapler is in the basket (B put it there, and nothing was ever moved out of the basket). The stapler is still in the basket.

So B knows the correct answer: the basket contains the stapler. B will answer correctly without any help from me.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room and put a banana in the basket.
2. B left the room.
3. While B was outside: C moved the banana from the basket to the bag. B doesn't know this.
4. B entered the room.
5. After B entered: D puts a brick in the basket. B sees this.

So B saw the brick being put in the basket (since B was in the room when D did it). B knows the basket contains a brick.

The basket currently contains a brick. B knows this because B was present when D put the brick in the basket.

B will answer correctly on their own, so I don't need to spend points telling B.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room. (B is outside, so B knows D left but doesn't see what happens inside)

5. B enters the room. (B doesn't know what's in the box)
6. D enters the room.
7. I leave the room.

So B does NOT know that I put a ball in the box, because B was outside when that happened. B needs to be told.

Since I'm going to be asked about what B knows, and B will be asked what's in the box, I should tell B the contents of the box so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B needs my help.

Let me trace through the events from B's perspective:

1. B starts in the room with everyone.
2. B leaves the room.
3. (While B is outside: D leaves, I put a brick in the bag, B enters the room)
   - Wait, let me re-read carefully.

Timeline:
1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. B leaves the room.
3. ... (time passes)
4. D leaves the room. (B is outside, so B knows D leaves but doesn't see what happens in the room)
5. ... (time passes)
6. I (A) put a brick in the bag. (B is outside the room, so B does NOT see this)
7. B enters the room. (B is now inside but doesn't know what happened while away)
8. D enters the room.
9. I (A) leave the room.
10. B leaves the room.
11. B enters the room.

So B was outside the room when I put the brick in the bag. B never saw what was placed in the bag. When B re-entered, B could see the room but cannot see inside containers. No one moved anything after B came back - the brick stayed in the bag.

B does NOT know what's in the bag. I need to tell B.

The question will be asked to B about the bag's contents. If B answers correctly, Blue gets 1 point. If I tell B, it costs 0.5 points but we gain 1 point for a net of +0.5.

Action: The brick is in the bag, and B was in the room when I put it there, so B knows the contents of the bag. However, after I left, B was still in the room for some time before leaving. During that time (indicated by "..."), something could have happened - C and D were still in the room and could have moved the brick or put something else in the bag.

But wait - I need to consider what B knows. B was in the room after I left, so B would have seen anything C and D did before B left. After B left, C and D were still in the room and could have changed things, but B wouldn't know about that.

The question is being asked to B about what's in the bag. B will answer based on what B last knew when B was in the room. Since the scenario only describes what I see, and I left before B, I don't know if C or D changed anything while B was still there.

However, B was present for everything that happened until B left. B knows what was in the bag when B left the room. Since I don't know what happened after I left (C and D might have moved things), but B does know what happened up until B left.

The safest action is to Pass, since:
1. B already knows the brick was placed in the bag (B was there when I did it).
2. B also knows anything that happened after I left but before B left.
3. B actually has MORE information than I do about the current state when B left.
4. Telling B something could actually give B worse information than what B already has, since C or D might have changed the bag's contents while B was still watching.

B answers: brick

Action: The question will be asked to B about what is in the bag.

Let me think about what B knows. B was in the room when I put a brick in the bag, so B saw that. Then B put an orange in the basket. Then I left the room, and then B left the room.

After both of us left, C and D were still in the room. They could have moved objects around without us knowing. However, B saw the brick go into the bag and has no reason to think it was moved (B left after me, but C and D were still there after B left too).

Wait - B left the room, so B doesn't know what C and D did after B left. But B's last knowledge is that the brick was in the bag. B would likely answer "brick" for the bag.

But could C or D have moved the brick out of the bag after we both left? Yes, they could have. However, the scenario doesn't describe any such action happening. The scenario only describes what I can observe. Since I left the room before B, and B left after me, anything that happened after I left wouldn't be described to me.

But the scenario ends with "B leaves the room. ..." - the ellipsis suggests time passed after B left, during which C and D could have done things. However, nothing is described because no one who could report to me was in the room.

Since B was present when the brick was placed in the bag, and B has no information about any changes after leaving, B should answer "brick." B knows the answer already.

I should Pass to save points since B already has the correct information.

B answers: brick

B was in the room when I put a brick in the bag. B was also in the room when D put a stapler in the basket. After that, I left the room, then B left the room. 

Between my leaving and B leaving, nothing happened (no events described). So B should know the bag contains a brick.

However, after B left the room, we don't know if anything happened. But looking at the scenario, there are no events described after B leaves. So the bag still contains a brick.

B was present when I put the brick in the bag, so B knows the bag contains a brick. B should be able to answer correctly without any help.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box now and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. I put a stapler in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
3. I leave the room. (I can no longer see what happens inside.)
4. B leaves the room. (B also can't see what happens inside.)
5. D leaves the room. (Only C is left inside - C could have done anything.)
6. D enters the room. (C and D are inside - things could happen.)
7. B enters the room. (B, C, D are inside - B can see what happens now.)
8. B leaves the room.

The key issue: Between when I left and when B entered, C was alone in the room (and then C and D were together). C could have moved the stapler out of the box or swapped things around. I don't know what happened.

When B re-entered the room (step 7), B would see whatever happens while B is there, but B can't see inside containers - B can only observe actions that occur while B is present. So B wouldn't know the current contents of the box unless someone moved something in/out of the box while B was in the room.

B originally saw me put the stapler in the box. B doesn't know if anything changed while B was outside. So B's best guess would be the stapler is still in the box, but B can't be sure.

From my perspective, I also don't know if C moved the stapler. But the most likely answer (if C had no reason to move things) is that the stapler is still in the box.

Since B will be asked about the box, and B last knew the stapler was in the box, B might answer "stapler" - which could be correct. But B might be uncertain about what happened while B was away.

I should tell B what I believe is in the box to reinforce B's knowledge, since B might second-guess. The cost is 0.5 points, and the reward is 1 point if correct.

Tell(B, box, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The box actually contains apple.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- I put an apple in the bag.
- B and C were both in the room when I put the apple in the bag, so they both saw it.
- B left the room first, then C left the room.
- Nothing else happened to the bag after I put the apple in it.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag.

**What C knows:** C was in the room when I put the apple in the bag. C saw this happen. After C left, nothing else happened (that C is unaware of). So C knows the apple is in the bag.

**C's incentive:** C is on the Red team. If C answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point. C knows the answer is "apple" and will likely answer correctly to earn a point for the Red team.

**My options:**
- **Pass:** Costs nothing, but C will likely answer "apple" correctly, giving Red 1 point.
- **Tell(C, bag, [something false]):** I could try to deceive C by telling them something different is in the bag. But C *saw* me put the apple in the bag. C would know I'm lying and would still answer "apple." This would cost me 0.5 points for nothing.

Since C was in the room and directly observed me putting the apple in the bag, there's no way to deceive C about this. Any Tell action would cost 0.5 points and C would ignore my lie since they have direct knowledge.

The best action is to not waste points on a futile deception attempt.

Pass
C answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about what C knows and whether I need to take any action.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when I put an apple in the bag. ✓ C knows the bag has an apple.
2. B leaves the room. C sees this.
3. C leaves the room. After this, C doesn't see anything else that happens.

So C knows:
- Bag: apple (C saw me put it there, and nothing happened to the bag before C left)
- Box: empty (as far as C knows)
- Basket: empty (as far as C knows)

The question is: What is in the bag?

C should know the answer is **apple**, since C was present when I put the apple in the bag, and the apple was never moved from the bag.

C is on the Red team, so if C answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point. I don't want that.

However, I can't prevent C from answering correctly since C directly witnessed me putting the apple in the bag. Any Tell action I make to C would cost my team 0.5 points, and C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). C already knows the correct answer.

I could try to Tell C misleading information, but C saw the apple go into the bag with their own eyes, so they're unlikely to be fooled. Spending 0.5 points on a deception that almost certainly won't work is a bad idea.

Pass
C answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and whether I need to take any action.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when I put an apple in the bag. ✓ C knows the bag has an apple.
2. B leaves the room. C sees this.
3. C leaves the room. After this, C doesn't see anything else that happens.

So C knows the bag contains an apple, because C was present when I put the apple in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to C.

C knows the answer is "apple." Since C is on the Red team, C will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly - C directly witnessed the apple being placed in the bag and left before any changes to the bag occurred (and in fact, no changes to the bag ever occurred).

If I Tell C wrong information, C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). It would cost me 0.5 points and likely not change C's answer.

The best action is to not waste points.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. I put a brick in the bag (everyone sees this - A, B, C, D all in room)
2. B leaves the room
3. C leaves the room
4. D moves brick from bag to box (only A and D see this)
5. D puts ball in bag (only A and D see this)
6. D moves ball from bag to basket (only A and D see this)
7. D moves brick from box to bag (only A and D see this)

**Current state:** Bag = brick, Box = empty, Basket = ball

**What C knows:** C saw the brick go into the bag, then left. C doesn't know about any moves after that. C's last knowledge is that the bag contains a brick.

**The question:** I'll be asked what C thinks is in the bag.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask C what is in the bag." So C will be answering.

C last saw the brick placed in the bag, then left the room. C is unaware of anything that happened after leaving. So C would naturally believe the bag still contains the brick.

The actual contents of the bag IS a brick (D moved it back). So C's answer of "brick" would be correct.

**C is on the Red team.** If C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. That's bad for me.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C wrong information to mislead them. But C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

However, C has no reason to think anything changed - C would naturally say "brick." If I tell C something different, C might become suspicious and either stick with their answer or change it.

Let me think about whether telling C false information could help. If I tell C "the bag contains a ball," C might think I'm trying to help (unlikely since I'm on the opposing team) or trying to deceive. Since C knows I'm on the Blue team, C would likely distrust me and stick with "brick."

Alternatively, if I tell C something that seems plausible - like "the bag is empty" or "the bag has a ball" - C might second-guess themselves. But C knows I have incentive to lie, so this could backfire.

The risk: Spending 0.5 points on a Tell that C ignores means we lose 0.5 points for nothing. If C was going to answer correctly anyway (brick), and my Tell doesn't change their mind, we're worse off.

But if there's a chance my Tell confuses C into answering wrong, it could prevent Red from gaining 1 point, at a cost of 0.5 to us. Net benefit = +0.5 for us relatively.

I think the best play is to try to mislead C.

Tell(C, bag, ball)
C answers: ball
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D saw:**
- C puts a stapler in the box (D was in the room)
- B leaves the room (D saw this)
- D moves the stapler from the box to the bag (D did this)
- C puts a ball in the box (D was in the room)
- D leaves the room (D left after seeing the ball placed in the box)

So D knows that the box contains a ball. D will answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - costs nothing, but D will likely answer "ball" correctly, giving Red 1 point.
2. **Tell(D, box, something false)** - costs 0.5 points, but D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team), and D already knows what's in the box since D was present when the ball was placed there. D would likely ignore my misinformation.
3. **Ask** - costs 0.5 points and doesn't help here.

Since D was in the room when the ball was put in the box, D knows the correct answer. Trying to mislead D would cost 0.5 points and almost certainly fail since D directly witnessed the ball being placed in the box. There's no reason for D to trust information from an opposing team member over their own direct observation.

The best action is to not waste points on a futile attempt at deception.

D answers: ball

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through the scenario from each player's perspective:

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone in room. C puts stapler in box.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves stapler from box to bag.
4. C puts ball in box.
5. D leaves the room.
6. C moves stapler from bag to basket.
7. I move stapler from basket to bag.
8. C moves stapler from bag to basket.

**Final state:** Basket has stapler, Box has ball, Bag is empty.

**What D knows:**
- D was present for steps 1-4: stapler in box, then D moved stapler to bag, then C put ball in box.
- D left at step 5. After that, D doesn't know what happened.
- From D's perspective: box has ball, bag has stapler, basket is empty (as of when D left).
- D doesn't know about steps 6-8.

**The question is: What is in the box?**
The correct answer is: **ball**.

D would likely answer "ball" since that's what was in the box when D left, and D has no information about changes after leaving. So D would probably get this right.

Since D is on the Red team, if D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. I want to prevent that.

I could Tell D false information about the box to mislead D. For example, I could tell D the box contains the stapler (or something else), which might cause D to second-guess and answer incorrectly. But this costs 0.5 points.

However, D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. D already believes the box has a ball (which is correct), so if I tell D something different, D might just ignore me since I'm an opponent with incentive to lie.

The risk: If I tell D wrong info and D ignores it, I lose 0.5 points for nothing. If D trusts me and answers wrong, Red loses 1 point and I spent 0.5 - net gain of 0.5 for my team.

But a rational player D would likely distrust information from an opponent, especially when D already has a reasonable belief. The expected value of telling D false info is probably negative.

I'll pass.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room. C puts a stapler in the box.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag.
4. C puts a ball in the box.
5. D leaves the room.
6. I move the stapler from the bag to the basket.
7. C moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.
8. I move the stapler from the bag to the basket.

Current state: **Box has a ball**, basket has a stapler, bag is empty.

Now, what does D know? D was present for steps 1-5, then left. At the time D left:
- Box had a ball (C put it there in step 4)
- Bag had a stapler (D moved it there in step 3)
- Basket was empty

D doesn't know about steps 6-8 (stapler moving around between bag and basket). But D does know the box has a ball.

So D should correctly answer "ball" for what's in the box. That would give the Red team 1 point.

The question is: can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell D false information to confuse them, but D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). D saw the ball placed in the box and nothing happened to the box after that from D's perspective. D would likely trust their own memory over my claim.

Alternatively, I could save my team's points and just Pass, since any Tell action would cost 0.5 points and D is unlikely to believe misinformation from an opponent.

However, let me consider: if I Tell D something false about the box, it costs me 0.5 points. D would likely ignore it since I'm an opponent. So it's a waste.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what D knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what D saw:

1. Everyone starts in the room. C puts a banana in the box.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D sees: D moves the banana from the box to the bag.
4. D sees: C puts a ball in the box.
5. D leaves the room.
6. After D leaves (D doesn't see these): C moves the banana from the bag to the basket. C moves the ball from the box to the bag. C moves the ball from the bag to the box.

So from D's perspective, when D left:
- Bag: banana
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

D didn't see any changes after leaving. So D believes the box contains a **ball**.

The actual state of the box is: **ball** (C moved the ball out and back in).

So D will likely answer "ball" which is correct, giving Red 1 point.

Now, should I take an action? I could Tell D wrong information to mislead them, costing my team 0.5 points but potentially preventing Red from getting 1 point.

If I Tell D that the box contains something else, D might believe me or might not. D knows what D saw. D knows I'm on the opposing team, so D should be skeptical of anything I tell them. Since D is on the Red team and I'm on the Blue team, D would likely distrust my Tell action.

If I tell D false information, I spend 0.5 points and D will probably ignore it since I'm an opponent. That would net us -0.5 for no benefit.

If I pass, D will likely answer "ball" correctly, giving Red 1 point. Score becomes Blue=0, Red=1.

If I tell D something false and D ignores it (likely), score becomes Blue=-0.5, Red=1. Worse.

There's a small chance D might second-guess themselves if I tell them something, but a rational player on the opposing team would ignore misinformation from an opponent.

The best action is to Pass.

D answers: ball

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and C are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a stapler in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... You move the stapler from the box to the bag. ... B puts an orange in the box. ... You move the orange from the box to the basket. ... B moves the stapler from the bag to the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what I should do.

Let me trace through what C saw before leaving the room:
- C was in the room when I put a stapler in the box.
- Then C left the room.

After C left:
- I moved the stapler from the box to the bag.
- B put an orange in the box.
- I moved the orange from the box to the basket.
- B moved the stapler from the bag to the box.

So C's last knowledge is that the stapler is in the box. C didn't see any of the subsequent moves.

Currently, the box contains the **stapler** (B moved it back there).

So C will likely answer "stapler" for what's in the box, which is actually correct! That would give the Red team 1 point.

I need to consider if I can do anything to prevent this. I could Tell C incorrect information about the box to mislead them, but C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. However, C might also think I'm trying to help or that the information is reliable.

Let me think about this strategically. C already believes the stapler is in the box (from what they saw). If I tell C something different, C might be suspicious since I'm on the Blue team and have incentive to mislead. But if I don't act, C will likely answer "stapler" correctly.

The risk: If I Tell C wrong information, it costs 0.5 points but might cause C to answer incorrectly (saving 1 point for Red). Net benefit would be +0.5 for Blue team relatively.

If I tell C something plausible, like "the box contains the orange," C might believe it since they know things could have changed after they left. But C might also be skeptical.

I think the best play is to try to mislead C. The cost is 0.5 points, but if it works, Red doesn't get their point.

Tell(C, box, orange)
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether I should help C or not.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**C's perspective:**
- C was in the room when D put a stapler in the bag.
- C then left the room.
- After C left: B moved the stapler from the bag to the box, and D put an orange in the bag. C doesn't know about these events.
- So C thinks the bag still contains the **stapler**.

**What's actually in the bag:** An **orange** (D put it there after B moved the stapler to the box).

C is on the Red team. If C is asked what's in the bag, C will likely answer "stapler" (which is wrong), meaning Red gets 0 points. This is good for my team.

I should **not** help C. If I tell C the truth, it would help the Red team. If I tell C a lie, it costs me 0.5 points and C might not trust me anyway. The best move is to do nothing and let C answer incorrectly.

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether I should help my team.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room initially with everyone.
2. D puts a stapler in the bag. (C sees this)
3. C leaves the room.

After C leaves, C doesn't see anything else. So C thinks the bag still has the stapler.

But what's actually in the bag? Let me trace the full sequence:
1. D puts stapler in bag. → Bag: stapler
2. B moves stapler from bag to box. → Bag: empty, Box: stapler
3. D puts orange in bag. → Bag: orange, Box: stapler
4. D moves stapler from box to basket. → Bag: orange, Basket: stapler
5. I move stapler from basket to box. → Bag: orange, Box: stapler
6. D moves stapler from box to basket. → Bag: orange, Basket: stapler

So the bag currently contains an **orange**.

C will be asked what's in the bag. C last saw the stapler being put in the bag, and then left. C likely thinks the bag contains the **stapler**, which is wrong. The correct answer is **orange**.

C is on the Red team, so if C answers wrong, that's good for my Blue team (Red doesn't get the point). C will probably answer "stapler" which is incorrect.

Should I tell C the correct answer? No! C is on the opposing team. I want C to get it wrong.

Should I tell C wrong information? That would cost 0.5 points, and C might not trust me anyway. C already likely believes it's the stapler, which is already wrong.

Could D help C? D was in the room the whole time and knows the bag has an orange. D might tell C. But it's MY turn right now, not D's turn.

The best action is to Pass - C is likely to answer incorrectly on their own, and I don't need to spend points.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what C saw before leaving the room:
1. D puts a stapler in the bag. (C saw this)
2. C leaves the room.

After C left:
- B moved the stapler from the bag to the box.
- D put an orange in the bag.
- B left the room.
- D moved the stapler from the box to the basket.
- I moved the stapler from the basket to the box.

So C last saw the stapler go into the bag. C doesn't know about any changes after leaving.

Current state of containers:
- Bag: orange
- Box: stapler
- Basket: empty

C will be asked what's in the bag. C last knew the stapler was in the bag, so C will likely answer "stapler." But the actual answer is "orange."

C is on the Red team, so if C answers incorrectly, that's good for my Blue team. C doesn't know about the orange being placed in the bag or the stapler being moved.

Now, D is on C's team and was in the room the whole time. D knows the bag contains an orange. But D's turn hasn't come yet - D might Tell C the correct answer.

Should I try to mislead C? I could Tell C false information. But C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Should I Pass? If I pass, D (C's teammate) might tell C the truth. But the action phase order matters - let me think about whether D gets a turn before C answers.

Actually, the key question is: will D get a turn to tell C before C has to answer? If so, D could tell C "orange" and C would get it right.

My best move is to try to preemptively mislead C. If I tell C something false about the bag, C might get confused. But C might also just ignore me since I'm on the opposing team.

Alternatively, I could tell C something that sounds plausible but is wrong. Since C already thinks the stapler is in the bag, if I "confirm" that by telling C the bag has the stapler, C will be more confident in the wrong answer and might ignore D's correction.

Let me reinforce C's incorrect belief:

Tell(C, bag, stapler)
C answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether I should help.

Let me trace through what C saw and knows:

1. C was in the room initially and saw D put a banana in the bag.
2. C left the room.
3. After C left: D moved banana from bag to basket, B moved banana from basket to bag, B moved banana from bag to box, D put an orange in the bag, B left the room.

C doesn't know about any of the moves after leaving. So C thinks the banana is still in the bag.

The actual contents of the bag: an orange (D put it there after all the banana moves).

C will be asked what's in the bag. C will likely answer "banana" (based on what they last saw). The correct answer is "orange."

Since C is on the Red team, I want C to answer incorrectly. C currently believes the bag contains a banana, which is wrong. If I do nothing, C will likely say "banana" and get it wrong - which is good for my team.

I should Pass to avoid giving C any helpful information.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a brick in the basket (everyone saw this since all were in the room)
- C left the room
- B left the room
- D moved the brick from the basket to the bag (only I and D saw this)
- D put an apple in the basket (only I and D saw this)

**What C knows:**
- C saw B put a brick in the basket
- C then left the room, so C doesn't know about any changes after that
- C thinks the brick is still in the basket

**What will C answer?**
C will be asked what's in the basket. C believes the brick is still in the basket, so C will likely answer "brick."

**The correct answer:** The basket contains an apple.

So C will answer incorrectly (saying "brick" instead of "apple"), which means Red gets 0 points from this question.

**Should I take an action?**
- If I Tell C the truth (that the basket has an apple), I'd spend 0.5 Blue points to help Red score 1 point. That's terrible for me.
- If I Tell C a lie, I'd spend 0.5 Blue points, but C might not trust me anyway since I'm on the opposing team.
- C is on the Red team and will likely answer "brick" which is wrong. This is good for Blue.

The best action is to Pass. C will answer incorrectly, Red scores nothing, and I don't spend any points.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: empty
- Box: brick
- Basket: apple

**What C knows:**
C was in the room when B put the brick in the basket. Then C left the room. C doesn't know about anything that happened after leaving. So C thinks:
- Basket: brick
- Bag: empty
- Box: empty

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the basket. Wait, no - C will be asked what is in the basket.

C will answer "brick" (since that's what C last saw in the basket), but the correct answer is "apple."

Since C is on the Red team, if C answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point. That's good for us.

But wait - can the Red team help C? Let me think about the turn order. It's currently my turn. After me, there could be turns for B, C, and D before the answer phase.

If D gets a turn before C answers, D could Tell C the correct contents of the basket (apple), which would help Red score.

I should consider whether to Pass or take an action. 

If I Pass (0 cost), C will likely answer "brick" which is wrong - Red gets 0 points. But D might get a turn and tell C the truth.

Actually, I could try to mislead C. If I Tell C that the basket contains something wrong, C might believe me or might not. But C is on the opposing team - why would C trust me?

The key question is: will D get a turn before the answer phase? If D does, D knows the basket has an apple and could tell C. 

I think the best strategy is to try to mislead C before D can correct them. If I tell C the basket contains "brick" (which C already believes), that reinforces C's wrong belief. But that costs 0.5 points.

Alternatively, if I Pass and D tells C the truth (costing Red 0.5), then C answers correctly (Red gets 1, net +0.5 for Red). If I Pass and D passes, C answers "brick" incorrectly, Red gets 0.

Actually, the risk is that D will tell C the correct answer. Let me preemptively tell C something misleading to create confusion. But C might just trust D over me since D is their teammate.

The best play is probably to **Pass**. C likely answers "brick" (wrong). Even if D tells C "apple," it costs Red 0.5 points, and C gets +1, netting Red only +0.5. If I spend 0.5 to mislead, and D still corrects C, we lose 0.5 for nothing.

C answers: brick
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone starts in the room. B puts a brick in the basket.
2. C leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves brick from basket to bag.
5. D puts apple in basket.
6. D moves brick from bag to box.
7. D moves brick from box to bag.

**Final state:**
- Bag: brick
- Box: empty
- Basket: apple

**What C knows:**
- C saw B put a brick in the basket.
- C left the room.
- C knows B left after them (C is aware of people entering/leaving).
- C doesn't know about any object movements after leaving.
- So C thinks: basket = brick (last thing C saw).

**The question is asking C what's in the basket.**

C will likely answer "brick" based on their knowledge, which is wrong (it's actually "apple"). So Red would get 0 points from this question.

However, I could potentially help C by telling them the truth, but C is on the Red team - I don't want to help them! 

Alternatively, I could try to mislead C. But C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

If I Tell C incorrect information, it costs me 0.5 points and C might or might not believe me. If C already thinks it's "brick" (which is wrong), any action I take risks either:
- Costing 0.5 points for no benefit
- Accidentally helping C if I tell them the truth

The best play is to do nothing. C will likely answer "brick" (wrong), Red gets 0 points, and I don't spend any points.

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and what the right answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario from C's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room. The bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. B puts a banana in the basket. (C sees this)
3. C leaves the room. (C no longer sees what happens)
4. After C leaves: B moves banana from basket to bag. (C doesn't see this)
5. D moves banana from bag to basket. (C doesn't see this)
6. B leaves the room. (C knows B left)
7. D moves banana from basket to box. (C doesn't see this)
8. D puts an apple in the basket. (C doesn't see this)

So C's last knowledge of the basket is that it contains a banana (from step 2). C doesn't know about any moves after leaving.

The actual contents of the basket is an **apple**.

C will likely answer "banana" (based on their last observation), which would be **wrong**. That's good for us (Blue team) since C is on the Red team.

However, C might get help from D. But it's currently MY turn in the action phase. I should consider whether to Tell, Ask, or Pass.

Since C is on the Red team and I want C to answer incorrectly, I should NOT help C. The question is whether I should try to mislead C or just Pass.

If I Tell C incorrect information, it costs 0.5 points. But C already has wrong information (thinks basket has banana). If I tell C something, C might become suspicious and reconsider. 

Actually, C's default answer of "banana" is already wrong. The best move is to Pass and let C answer incorrectly based on their outdated information. Any action I take either costs points or risks accidentally helping the Red team.

C answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when I put an orange in the box.
2. C left the room.
3. After C left: D left, B moved the orange from box to bag, I put a ball in the box.

So C last saw the orange being put in the box. C doesn't know about B moving the orange to the bag or me putting a ball in the box. C will likely answer "orange" when asked what's in the box.

The correct answer is "ball" (since B moved the orange to the bag, and I put a ball in the box).

C will probably answer "orange" which is wrong - that's good for us! Red won't get a point.

I should Pass since C is likely to answer incorrectly on their own, and any action I take would cost us 0.5 points. I shouldn't tell C the correct answer since C is on the opposing team.

Pass
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put an orange in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the orange from the box to the bag. ... You put a ball in the box. ... B moves the orange from the bag to the basket. ... You move the orange from the basket to the bag. ...

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what I should do.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. Everyone starts in the room. The bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. I put an orange in the box. (C sees this)
3. C leaves the room. (After this, C doesn't see anything that happens)

So from C's perspective, the last thing they saw was the orange being placed in the box. C doesn't know about any subsequent moves.

After C left:
- D left
- B moved the orange from box to bag
- I put a ball in the box
- B moved the orange from bag to basket
- I moved the orange from basket to bag
- B moved the orange from bag to basket

So currently, the box contains a **ball** and the basket contains the **orange**.

C will likely answer "orange" for what's in the box, since that's the last thing C saw before leaving. But the correct answer is "ball."

Since C is on the Red team, I want C to answer incorrectly. C will probably say "orange" which is indeed wrong - the box actually contains a ball. So C answering incorrectly is good for my team.

If I Tell C the truth (that the box contains a ball), that would help the Red team score, which is bad for me. If I Pass, C will likely guess "orange" which is wrong, and Red gets no points.

I should Pass to avoid helping the opposing team.

Pass
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone is in the room. I put an orange in the box.
2. C leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. B moves the orange from the box to the bag.
5. I put a ball in the box.
6. B moves the orange from the bag to the basket.
7. B moves the orange from the basket to the bag.

**Current state:** Box has a ball, bag has an orange, basket is empty.

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put an orange in the box (C was in the room).
- C then left the room. After that, C only knows that D left the room.
- C does NOT know about any moves after they left.
- So C thinks: box has an orange, bag is empty, basket is empty.

**The question is asking C what is in the box.**

C will likely answer "orange" because that's the last thing C saw placed in the box before leaving.

The correct answer is "ball" (which is what's actually in the box).

Since C is on the Red team, and C will likely answer incorrectly (saying "orange" instead of "ball"), this is good for us! Red won't get the point.

I should not help C. There's no reason to Tell C the correct answer. I should also consider whether I need to do anything else. Since C is likely to answer wrong on their own, I should just Pass to avoid spending points.

Pass
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what would be optimal here.

Let me trace through what C saw before leaving:
1. I put a banana in the box (C saw this)
2. C leaves the room

So C's last knowledge is that the banana is in the box. C doesn't know about any subsequent moves.

Now the actual state:
- Bag: banana
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

C will likely answer "banana" for the box, which is **wrong**. That means Red gets 0 points from this question.

Since C is going to answer incorrectly on their own (they think the banana is still in the box), I don't need to help them. And I don't need to spend points on any action.

Pass
C answers: banana

Action: I need to think about what I know and what D knows.

Let me trace through the events:
1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. C puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens.)

5. C puts an orange in the basket. (A, C, D see this.)
6. A (me) leaves the room. (I no longer see what happens.)

So at the point I left, the basket contained an orange. D was still in the room, so D knows what's in the basket.

The question will be asked to D (Red team). D knows the basket contains an orange (or whatever may have changed after I left, but D was present the whole time). D will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point.

Since D is on the Red team and knows the correct answer, there's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly. Any Ask or Tell action would cost my team 0.5 points without benefit.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether D knows the answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room. All containers empty.
2. C puts a stapler in the basket. → Basket: stapler
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. → Basket: empty, Bag: stapler
5. C puts an orange in the basket. → Basket: orange
6. D moves the stapler from the bag to the box. → Bag: empty, Box: stapler
7. I (A) move the stapler from the box to the bag. → Box: empty, Bag: stapler
8. C moves the stapler from the bag to the box. → Bag: empty, Box: stapler
9. I (A) leave the room.

At the point I leave, the state is:
- Basket: orange
- Box: stapler
- Bag: empty

D was in the room the entire time and saw everything, so D knows the basket contains an orange. D will answer correctly.

Since D is on the Red team, D answering correctly gives Red 1 point. I need to consider if there's anything I can do to prevent this.

I could try to Tell D false information about the basket, hoping to confuse D. But D was in the room the whole time and saw everything - D knows the basket has an orange. D would likely not believe my false Tell.

However, after I left the room, things might have changed. But I only know that I left - I don't know what happened after. D is still in the room and would know the current state.

Let me think about whether a Tell with misinformation could work. D saw everything happen while in the room. If I tell D something false about the basket, D has no reason to believe me over their own direct observation. D would almost certainly ignore my misinformation.

The best action is to Pass, since spending 0.5 points on a Tell that D will ignore just costs my team points.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

D was in the room the entire time and saw everything I saw. D knows:

Since D is on the Red team, D will answer correctly (orange) and score a point for Red. There's nothing I can do to prevent D from knowing what's in the basket - D has been in the room the whole time and has perfect information.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through the scenario from each player's perspective:

**My perspective (A):**
- I saw everything until I left the room.
- When I left, the box had the brick, and the basket had the orange.
- After I left, B entered and then left. I don't know if anything changed while I was out.

**D's perspective:**
- D was present from the start, saw C put brick in basket.
- D left the room, missing C moving brick from basket to bag.
- D re-entered: At this point D thinks brick is in basket (doesn't know it moved to bag and back). But actually C moved it back to basket before D entered, so D sees the brick in the basket (consistent with D's belief).
- D then saw C move brick from basket to box.
- D saw C put orange in basket.
- Then A (me) left. D was still in the room.
- Then B entered. D was still in the room.
- Then B left. D was still in the room.

So D knows what happened the entire time after re-entering. When I left, the state was: box=brick, basket=orange, bag=empty. D was in the room when B entered and left, so D would know if anything changed.

**The question is: What is in the basket?**

D knows the basket has the orange (assuming nothing changed after I left, which D would know about since D stayed in the room the whole time).

D should answer "orange" correctly. This scores a point for Red.

**What can I do?**
- I could Tell D false information to trick D, but D was in the room and knows the basket has an orange. D would likely not believe me since D has direct knowledge.
- I could Pass to save points.

Since D has direct knowledge of the basket contents (D was in the room the entire time after re-entering and never left again), any attempt to mislead D would likely fail, and it would cost us 0.5 points.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

7. I leave the room.

After I leave, I don't know what happens in the room. But the question is being asked to C about what's in the box.

At the point I left:
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty
- Basket: stapler

C is in the room the entire time, so C knows exactly what's in every container. C will be asked what's in the box.

Since C is on the Red team, C will answer correctly (it benefits their team to get +1 point). The question is whether anything changed after I left the room.

From my perspective, when I left, the box had a brick. C knows this. Since C is on the Red team and gets a point for answering correctly, C will answer truthfully.

The key question: could something have changed after I left? I don't know. But C was in the room the whole time, so C knows the current state.

Since C is on the Red team, C will answer correctly to earn a point for Red. There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly - C has perfect information about the box's contents.

I could try to Tell C false information, but C was in the room the whole time and knows exactly what's in the box, so C wouldn't be fooled.

There's no beneficial action I can take here. Any Ask or Tell would cost 0.5 points with no benefit.

5. I (A) put an apple in the bag. C sees this because C is in the room.
6. I leave the room.

So from C's perspective:
- C put a stapler in the bag originally
- C left and came back - C doesn't know about D moving the stapler to the box
- C saw me put an apple in the bag

Wait - C knows the bag can only hold one object. So when C sees me put an apple in the bag, C would think the stapler was already in the bag (since C didn't see it get moved). But containers can hold at most one object. So if I put an apple in the bag, that means the stapler must no longer be in the bag (from C's perspective, this might be confusing).

Actually, let me re-read: "Each container can hold at most one object." So when I put the apple in the bag, the bag was actually empty (D had moved the stapler to the box). The apple successfully went into the bag.

From C's perspective: C left, came back, and then saw me put an apple in the bag. Since the bag can only hold one object, and C saw me put an apple in, C might reason that the stapler was removed while C was away. C now knows the apple is in the bag.

So C likely knows the bag contains an apple. The correct answer is "apple."

C is on the Red team, so C answering correctly gives Red a point. I want C to answer incorrectly.

I could try to mislead C by telling C something false about the bag. But C actually *saw* me put the apple in the bag, so C has direct knowledge. No amount of telling will override what C directly observed.

Since C directly witnessed the apple being placed in the bag and is still in the room, C almost certainly knows the answer is "apple." I can't effectively mislead C here, so spending 0.5 points on a Tell would be wasteful.

Pass
C answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. The bag, box, and basket are all empty.
2. C puts a brick in the bag. → Bag has brick.
3. I (A) leave the room. → I can no longer see what happens inside.
4. **Things may have happened while I was outside that I don't know about.** I only know if someone enters or leaves the room.
5. I enter the room. → I can now see what happens again.
6. D moves the brick from the box to the bag. → This tells me that at the time D did this, the brick was in the box. So while I was outside, someone must have moved the brick from the bag to the box. After D's action, the brick is now in the bag.

So after step 6, the bag contains the brick.

But wait - I need to consider whether anything else happened after step 6. The scenario ends with "..." after D's move, but no further actions are described. Since I'm in the room, I would see anything that happens. So nothing else happened.

The bag contains the brick.

However, I should also consider: while I was outside, other objects might have been placed in containers too. But the question is specifically about the bag. After D moves the brick from the box to the bag, the bag has the brick. Since I'm in the room after that and nothing else happens, the bag still has the brick.

I'm confident the answer is the brick. No need to spend points asking anyone.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the scenario from my perspective:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. C puts a banana in the bag. (I see this - only me and C are in the room)
5. B enters the room.
6. D enters the room.
7. D puts an apple in the basket. (I, B, C, and D all see this)
8. D leaves the room.
9. D enters the room.
10. B leaves the room.
11. B enters the room.
12. I leave the room.

After I leave the room, I don't know if anything else happened. But the scenario ends there, so I need to consider whether anything could have changed after I left.

Wait - the scenario description says "You leave the room" and then "..." with nothing after. The question is asking me what's in the bag. 

I saw C put a banana in the bag. After that, the people in the room at various times could have moved things. Let me check if anything happened to the bag after the banana was placed:

- After C puts banana in bag: B enters, D enters, D puts apple in basket, D leaves, D enters, B leaves, B enters, I leave.

No one is described as moving the banana out of the bag before I left. After I left, I can't see what happens, but the scenario doesn't describe any further actions (the "..." after I leave just indicates passage of time).

However, I need to be careful - after I leave, things could happen that aren't described to me. But based on what I know, the banana was in the bag when I left, and I have no information suggesting it was moved.

I know the answer: the bag contains a banana. There's no need to spend points asking anyone.

13. I leave the room → I can no longer see what happens

After step 12, D enters the room. Then I leave. At the point I left, the bag had the ball. But after I left, things could have happened that I'm not aware of.

However, I need to consider: who is in the room after I leave? After step 13, B, C, and D should be in the room (B entered at step 5 and never left; C was always in the room; D entered at step 12). Any of them could have moved things after I left.

But the scenario says "I am going to ask you what is in the bag." Since I'm being asked, I need to answer based on what I know. The last thing I saw was the ball in the bag (after step 10). After I left, I don't know if anything changed.

Since I don't know if anything happened after I left, I could ask someone who's still in the room. But the question is being asked of me, and I should try to get the right answer.

Let me ask my teammate B, who is still in the room and would know the current state.

Ask(B, bag)
A answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events I witnessed:

1. I put a ball in the basket. (basket: ball)
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. (basket: empty, bag: ball)
4. C puts a brick in the basket. (basket: brick)
5. D moves the ball from the bag to the box. (bag: empty, box: ball)
6. I move the ball from the box to the bag. (box: empty, bag: ball)
7. D moves the ball from the bag to the box. (bag: empty, box: ball)
8. I leave the room.

At the time I left the room, the basket contained a brick. After I left, something could have happened, but I wouldn't know about it.

However, the question is asking **me** what is in the basket. I know that when I left, the basket had a brick. Something might have changed after I left, but I have no information about that.

Since I'm being asked the question and I was present when the brick was placed in the basket, and I saw no one remove it before I left, my best knowledge is that the basket contains a brick.

But wait - something could have happened after I left. C and D are still in the room. Should I ask someone?

If I ask C or D (opponents), they might lie. If I ask B, B left before the brick was placed, so B wouldn't know about the brick unless told.

The risk is that C or D moved the brick after I left. But asking C or D costs 0.5 points and they might lie anyway. My best bet is that the basket still contains the brick - there's no guarantee anything changed, and spending 0.5 points on potentially unreliable information isn't worth it.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a ball in the basket. → Basket: ball
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. → Basket: empty, Bag: ball
4. C puts a brick in the basket. → Basket: brick
5. I move the ball from the bag to the box. → Bag: empty, Box: ball
6. D moves the ball from the box to the bag. → Box: empty, Bag: ball
7. C moves the ball from the bag to the box. → Bag: empty, Box: ball
8. I move the ball from the box to the bag. → Box: empty, Bag: ball
9. C moves the ball from the bag to the box. → Bag: empty, Box: ball
10. I move the ball from the box to the bag. → Box: empty, Bag: ball
11. I leave the room.

At the point I left the room:
- Basket: brick
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty

After I left the room, things could have changed. But the scenario description ends with "..." after I leave, and no further events are described to me (I would only know if someone enters or leaves the room, and no such events are mentioned).

So from my perspective, the basket contains a **brick** as of when I left. Since I have no information about changes after I left, and no one entered or left the room after me (which I would have been told about), C and D are still in the room and could have moved things.

However, I have no indication that anything changed. The question is asking me what's in the basket. Based on my knowledge, it's a brick. Since I was present when C put the brick in the basket, and no one moved the brick out of the basket while I was there, I'm confident it's a brick.

But C and D could have moved things after I left. Should I ask? The cost is 0.5 points, and the reward for a correct answer is 1 point. If I'm fairly confident it's still a brick, passing is better.

Given that I saw the brick placed and never saw it removed, and there's no strong reason to think C or D would move it, I'll go with my knowledge.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events:

1. **I, B, C, D are in the room.** I put an apple in the basket. → Basket: apple
2. **B leaves the room.** (I, C, D still in room)
3. **D moves the apple from the basket to the bag.** → Basket: empty, Bag: apple
4. **C puts a brick in the basket.** → Basket: brick
5. **I leave the room.** (C, D still in room)
6. **I enter the room.** (I, C, D in room)
7. **D moves the brick from the basket to the box.** → Basket: empty, Box: brick
8. **C moves the brick from the box to the basket.** → Basket: brick, Box: empty
9. **I leave the room.** (C, D still in room)
10. **B enters the room.** (B, C, D in room)
11. **B leaves the room.**

Now, after step 9, I left the room. Between step 9 and when I might answer, things could have happened that I didn't see. Steps 10-11 show B entering and leaving, but I don't know what happened inside the room during that time (I only know about people entering/leaving).

So from my perspective, the last thing I saw was C moving the brick from the box to the basket (step 8). After that, I left and B entered and left. I don't know if anything changed while I was outside.

The question asks **me** what is in the basket. Based on what I last observed, the basket contains a **brick**. But something could have changed while I was outside (steps 10-11).

Since I don't know if anything happened while B was in the room, I could ask B. But B would only know what happened during their brief visit (steps 10-11). However, the question is being asked to me, and I need to decide if spending 0.5 points to ask B is worth it.

The risk is that C and D might have moved things while I was out. Let me consider: if nothing changed, the answer is "brick." If I ask B, I spend 0.5 points but get certainty.

Given that it's early in the game and getting the answer right is worth 1 point (net 0.5 if I ask), versus potentially getting it wrong (0 points), I think asking B is worthwhile for safety.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket based on what I observed.

Let me trace through the events I witnessed:

1. **I'm in the room with B, C, D.** D leaves the room.
2. **B puts an orange in the basket.** (I see this)
3. **D enters the room.**
4. **I leave the room.** (From this point, I can't see what happens inside)
5. **I enter the room.** (I can now see what happens again)
6. **C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.** (I see this)
7. **D moves the orange from the bag to the basket.** (I see this)
8. **I leave the room.** (I can't see what happens anymore)
9. **C leaves the room.**

So when I left the room the second time (step 8), the orange was in the basket (D had just moved it there in step 7).

After I left, C was still in the room with D (and possibly B). Then C leaves the room. Between my leaving and C leaving, something could have happened that I didn't see. But the scenario only describes C leaving - no object movements are described during that time.

However, I need to be careful: the scenario describes what I see/know. If something happened while I was outside, it wouldn't be described to me. So between step 8 (I leave) and step 9 (C leaves), things could have happened that I'm unaware of.

But based on what I last observed, the orange was in the basket. The question is whether anything changed after I left.

Since I'm uncertain about what happened after I left, and the question is directed at me, let me consider whether to ask someone who was in the room after I left. B might still have been in the room, and D was in the room. But B is my teammate, so asking B would be most reliable.

Actually, let me check: B was in the room the whole time (never described as leaving). So B saw everything that happened after I left. Let me ask B.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through the events:

1. B puts a ball in the box. (I see this)
2. I leave the room. (I can't see what happens while I'm gone)
3. I enter the room. (I can see again)
4. C moves the ball from the box to the basket. (I see this)
5. D moves the ball from the basket to the box. (I see this)
6. I leave the room. (I can't see what happens after this)

So at the point I left the room the second time, the ball was in the box. The question is whether anything happened after I left the room the second time.

Since the scenario ends with "..." after I leave, something *could* have happened that I'm not aware of. But I wasn't told about anyone entering or leaving the room, which means B didn't enter or leave (I would know that). C and D were still in the room and could have moved things around without my knowledge.

So I'm uncertain about the current state of the box. When I left, the ball was in the box, but C and D could have moved it after I left.

I should ask someone who is (or was) in the room after I left. C and D were in the room and would know the current state. However, C and D are on the Red team and might lie to me.

B is my teammate, but B's status is unclear. B was in the room initially. I wasn't told B left before my first departure, so B was in the room. I wasn't told B left while I was outside either time. So B should still be in the room and would know the current contents.

Let me ask B, my teammate, what's in the box. B has no reason to lie to me.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What's in the containers now:**
- Basket: banana (D put it there)
- Box: ball (I moved it back from bag to box)
- Bag: empty

**What B knows:**
B was in the room when D put the banana in the basket. Then C left, then B left. B was NOT in the room when I put the ball in the box, when D moved the ball to the bag, or when I moved the ball back to the box.

So B knows:
- Basket: banana (saw D put it there)
- Box: empty (as far as B knows)
- Bag: empty (as far as B knows)

**The question is: What is in the basket?**

B actually knows the correct answer! D put the banana in the basket while B was still in the room, and nothing happened to the basket after that (all subsequent moves involved the box and bag). So B should correctly answer "banana" for the basket.

Since B already knows the correct answer, I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**What I know (Player A):**
- Basket: banana (D put it there, everyone saw it)
- Box: apple (D moved it there last)
- Bag: empty (apple was moved out)

**What B knows:**
- B saw D put a banana in the basket (B was in the room for that)
- B then left the room, so B doesn't know about any subsequent moves
- B knows the basket has a banana (from when B was still in the room)

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the basket.

B saw D put the banana in the basket, and then C left, then B left. Nothing happened to the basket after that (only the apple was moved around between the bag and box). So B correctly knows the basket contains a banana.

Since B already knows the correct answer (banana is in the basket), I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B anything. The best action is to Pass.

B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts a brick in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. D moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (Only A and D see this)
6. D puts a banana in the basket. (Only A and D see this)
7. D moves the banana from the basket to the box. (Only A and D see this)
8. D moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (Only A and D see this)

Final state:
- Bag: empty
- Box: banana
- Basket: brick

B's perspective: B only saw D put a brick in the basket (step 2), then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B would think the basket still contains the brick.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to B.

The actual answer is: the brick is in the basket.

B would naturally answer "brick" based on their last knowledge, which happens to be correct! The brick was moved around but ended up back in the basket.

So B's natural answer (brick) is actually correct. I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B anything - B will get it right on their own.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows the answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. C puts a stapler in the basket.
2. C leaves the room.
3. B moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.
4. B puts a banana in the basket.
5. B leaves the room.
6. I move the stapler from the bag to the box.
7. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag.
8. I move the stapler from the bag to the box.

So currently:
- **Basket**: banana
- **Box**: stapler
- **Bag**: empty

B was present for steps 1-4, then left. B knows that when they left:
- Basket had a banana
- Bag had a stapler
- Box was empty

After B left, the stapler moved around (bag → box → bag → box), but the banana stayed in the basket.

So B should know the basket contains a banana, since B put the banana there and nothing happened to the basket after that. B doesn't know about the stapler movements, but that's irrelevant to the basket question.

Since B already knows the correct answer (banana is in the basket), I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

2. C puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room.
4. B moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (A and B and D see this)

6. B leaves the room.
7. D moves the stapler from the bag to the box. (A and D see this - B is outside)
8. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (A and D see this - B is outside)

Current state:
- Bag: stapler
- Box: empty
- Basket: banana

B was present when the banana was put in the basket (B did it themselves). B left after that, and nothing happened to the basket after B left. So B knows the basket contains a banana.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to B. The answer is **banana**, and B knows this because B put the banana in the basket and nothing changed in the basket after that (the moves after B left only involved the stapler moving between bag and box).

B should answer correctly without any help from me. No need to spend points.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room.
2. C puts an apple in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room. (A, B, D remain)
4. B moves the apple from the basket to the box. (A, B, D see this)
5. B puts a banana in the basket. (A, B, D see this)
6. B leaves the room. (A, D remain)
7. D moves the banana from the basket to the bag. (A, D see this - B doesn't)
8. D moves the banana from the bag to the basket. (A, D see this - B doesn't)

So the basket currently contains a **banana**.

Now, what does B know? B was present for steps 1-5, then left. At the time B left, the banana was in the basket. After B left, D moved the banana around but ultimately put it back in the basket.

So B would believe the basket contains a banana (which is correct), since that's what was there when B left.

Since B's belief matches reality - the basket contains a banana - B should answer correctly without any help from me. There's no need to spend 0.5 points on a Tell action.

B answers: banana

Let me think about what B knows:
- B was in the room when I put a brick in the bag.
- Then B left the room.
- After B left: C put an orange in the box, D moved the orange to the basket, I moved the orange back to the box.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and tell B, since B will be asked.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a banana in the box. (Everyone sees this)
2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. D moves the banana from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. C puts an apple in the box. (B doesn't see this)
5. D moves the apple from the box to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
6. C moves the banana from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)

So the current state is:
- Box: banana
- Basket: apple
- Bag: empty

B last saw me put a banana in the box, then B left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. B might guess the banana is still in the box (which happens to be correct now), but B doesn't know about all the shuffling that happened.

Actually, since B's last knowledge is that the banana is in the box, and the banana IS currently in the box, B might answer correctly without my help. But B doesn't know for certain that nothing changed after they left.

The question is whether it's worth spending 0.5 points to tell B. If B guesses "banana" on their own (which is reasonable since that's the last thing they saw), we get 1 point for free. If I tell B, we get 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 points net.

However, B knows that other players (C and D from the Red team) were still in the room and could have moved things. B might be uncertain. To be safe, I should tell B the correct answer to guarantee the point.

Tell(B, box, banana)
B answers: banana

1. I put an orange in the basket (everyone in room: A, B, C, D)
2. B leaves the room
3. D moves the orange from the basket to the bag (A, C, D see this)
4. C puts a banana in the basket (A, C, D see this)
5. D leaves the room

**Current state:**
- Bag: orange
- Basket: banana
- Box: empty

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put an orange in the basket
- B then left the room
- B doesn't know about D moving the orange to the bag or C putting a banana in the basket
- So B thinks: basket = orange

**The question is: What is in the basket?**
The correct answer is: **banana**

B will be asked what's in the basket. B thinks it's the orange (since B left before the changes happened). B would answer "orange," which is wrong.

I need to tell B the correct contents of the basket so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Tell(B, basket, banana)
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put an orange in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the orange from the basket to the bag. ... C puts a banana in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the orange from the bag to the box. ... C moves the orange from the box to the bag. ... You move the orange from the bag to the box. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and tell B, since B will be asked about it.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put an orange in the basket. (Everyone sees this - A, B, C, D all in room)
2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. D moves the orange from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. C puts a banana in the basket. (B doesn't see this)
5. D leaves the room.
6. I move the orange from the bag to the box.
7. C moves the orange from the box to the bag.
8. I move the orange from the bag to the box.

So currently:
- **Basket**: banana
- **Box**: orange
- **Bag**: empty

B last saw the orange being put in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about the banana in the basket or the orange being moved. B would likely guess "orange" for the basket, which is wrong.

I need to tell B that the basket contains a banana.

Tell(B, basket, banana)
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room initially and saw me put an orange in the basket.
2. B then left the room.
3. After B left: D moved the orange from basket to bag, C put a banana in the basket, C moved the orange from bag to box, I moved the orange from box to bag.

B doesn't know about any of these changes after leaving. So B thinks the basket still contains the orange.

But the basket actually contains a **banana** (C put it there after D moved the orange out).

I need to tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a ball in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the ball from the basket to the box. ... C moves the ball from the box to the basket. ... D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. ... C puts a banana in the basket. ...

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows this.

Let me trace through the events:
1. I put a ball in the basket. (Everyone sees this - A, B, C, D are all in the room)
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the ball from the basket to the box. (B doesn't see this)
4. C moves the ball from the box to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
5. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
6. C puts a banana in the basket. (B doesn't see this)
7. D leaves the room.

So the basket currently contains a **banana**.

B last saw me put a ball in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. B would think the basket still contains the ball.

Since I'm going to be asked about B's answer, and B will be asked what's in the basket, I need to tell B the correct contents so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point.

The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we get 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points. If I pass, B will likely say "ball" (which is wrong) and we get 0 points.

Tell(B, basket, banana)
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the box, then left the room.
- After B left, C moved the apple from the box to the bag, and put a stapler in the box.
- B doesn't know about these changes since B was outside the room.
- B will think the apple is still in the box.

**What will happen in the answer phase:**
- B will be asked what's in the box.
- B believes the apple is in the box (since B left before the swap).
- The actual contents of the box is a stapler.
- B will likely answer "apple," which is wrong. Blue team gets 0 points.

**Should I Tell B?**
If I tell B the box contains a stapler, it costs 0.5 points but B can answer correctly for +1 point, netting +0.5 points.

If I Pass, B will likely say "apple" and get 0 points, netting 0 points.

**But could C or D interfere?** C and D are on the Red team. C knows the truth (C made the swap). D was outside during the swap. However, the action phase order matters - it's currently my turn. After me, other players may get turns before the answer phase. C or D might try to Tell B false information to mislead B.

However, if I Tell B the truth now, B will have my information. Even if C or D later tell B something different, B should trust me (their teammate) over opponents.

The optimal play is to tell B the truth about the box.

Tell(B, box, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

- C put an apple in the bag
- B left the room
- C moved the apple from the bag to the box
- C put a stapler in the bag

**What B knows:** B was present when C put the apple in the bag, then B left. B did NOT see C move the apple to the box or put the stapler in the bag. So B thinks the bag still has an apple.

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the bag. The correct answer is **stapler**.

B will likely answer "apple" based on their outdated knowledge, which would be **wrong**. I need to tell B what's actually in the bag so our team gets the point.

The cost of a Tell action is 0.5 points, but getting the answer right gives us 1 point, so the net gain is +0.5 points. This is better than passing (which would result in 0 points since B would answer incorrectly).

I should also consider whether C or D might try to mislead B, but since my Tell action is private between me and B, and I'm B's teammate, I should just tell B the truth.

B's knowledge: B saw C put an apple in the bag, then B left. B doesn't know about any changes after that. So B thinks the bag still has an apple.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B.

The correct answer is **stapler**. B thinks it's an **apple** (based on what B last saw).

Since B is my teammate, I should tell B what's in the bag so B answers correctly and we get 1 point. This costs 0.5 points, but gains 1 point, for a net of +0.5.

If I Pass, B will likely answer "apple" (which is wrong), and we get 0 points.

6. C moves the banana from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)
7. C puts a stapler in the bag. (B doesn't see this)

So the current state is:
- Bag: stapler
- Box: banana
- Basket: empty

B's knowledge: B last saw the banana put in the bag, then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B would think the bag still contains the banana.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B.

B would likely answer "banana" based on their knowledge, but the correct answer is "stapler."

Since B is my teammate, I should tell B what's actually in the bag so they can answer correctly and earn us 1 point. The Tell action costs 0.5 points, but a correct answer gives 1 point, netting us +0.5 points.

If I Pass, B will likely answer "banana" (incorrect) and we get 0 points.

If I Tell B the correct contents, we spend 0.5 but gain 1.0, for a net of +0.5.

Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Let me trace through what B has seen:

1. Everyone starts in the room.
2. I (A) put a banana in the bag. - B sees this.
3. C leaves the room. - B sees this.
4. B puts a stapler in the box. - B does this.

6. I move the stapler from the basket to the box. - B sees this.

B was in the room the entire time and saw me put the banana in the bag. Nothing else happened to the bag after that. So B knows the bag contains a banana.

B can answer correctly without any help. I should Pass to save points.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the box and whether I need to help.

Let me trace through what B saw:

1. **Everyone in room**: I put a stapler in the box. B sees this.
2. **B leaves the room**: B doesn't see what happens next.
3. **C moves stapler from box to bag**: B is outside, doesn't see this.
4. **B enters the room**: B is now back.
5. **D moves stapler from bag to box**: B sees this happen.
6. **C leaves the room**: B sees this.

So what does B know? B saw me put the stapler in the box initially. Then B left. When B returned, B saw D move the stapler from the bag to the box. So B knows the stapler is currently in the box.

The box currently contains the stapler, and B knows this. B should answer correctly without any help from me.

B answers: stapler

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can answer correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw (B was in the room the entire time):

1. C puts a stapler in the basket. (B sees this)
2. D leaves the room. (B sees this)
3. C leaves the room. (B sees this)
4. I move the stapler from the basket to the bag. (B sees this)
5. I put an orange in the basket. (B sees this)
6. I move the stapler from the bag to the box. (B sees this)
7. B moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (B does this)
8. I move the stapler from the bag to the box. (B sees this)

So B knows everything that happened. The basket currently contains an orange. B was present for step 5 when I put the orange in the basket, and nothing was removed from the basket after that.

B should know the basket contains an orange. B has full information here, so there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

Pass
B answers: orange

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the basket.

Let me trace through B's perspective:
1. B is in the room when I put the stapler in the basket. B knows: basket = stapler.
2. B leaves the room. B doesn't see what happens next.
3. While B is outside: D moves the stapler from basket to bag. B doesn't know this.
4. B enters the room. B doesn't see the current state of containers (players can't see inside containers).
5. While B is in the room: D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. B sees this happen.

So when B re-enters the room, B doesn't know the bag's contents. Then B sees D move the stapler from the bag to the basket. So B now knows the stapler is in the basket.

Wait - B sees D move the stapler from the bag to the basket. So B knows the basket contains the stapler.

The answer to "what is in the basket?" is the stapler, and B should know this because B witnessed D moving the stapler from the bag to the basket after re-entering the room.

B should be able to answer correctly without any help. I'll Pass to save points.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and tell B, since B will be asked about it.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. Bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C puts an apple in the box.
4. C puts an orange in the basket.
5. I move the orange from the basket to the bag.
6. D moves the orange from the bag to the basket.
7. I leave the room.

B left the room before anything was put in the containers, so B doesn't know what's in any container. B only knows that I left the room at the end.

The box contains an apple (it was placed there in step 3 and never moved).

I should tell B what's in the box so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C puts an apple in the box.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the bag and whether I need to help.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room (empty bag, box, basket)
2. B leaves the room
3. C puts an orange in the bag (B is outside, doesn't see this; A, C, D see it)
4. A (me) leaves the room
5. D leaves the room
6. D enters the room (D can now see current state, but entering doesn't reveal container contents - D already knew from before)
7. B enters the room (B is now in the room, but nothing happens to reveal bag contents)
8. B leaves the room

Key question: Does B know what's in the bag?

B left before the orange was put in the bag. When B re-entered the room, B would only be aware of events happening while B is in the room. Since nothing happened to the bag while B was in the room, B doesn't know the orange was placed there. B last saw the bag as empty, but things could have changed while B was away.

B doesn't know the bag contains an orange. I need to tell B.

Tell(B, bag, orange)
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put an apple in the box (I saw this, and D did it, so D knows).
- B left the room, then D left the room.
- The apple is still in the box (nothing happened to change that after D put it there).

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the box.

**What D knows:** D put the apple in the box. After D left, nothing happened (from D's perspective, D doesn't know if anything changed after leaving, but in reality nothing did change). D should reasonably answer "apple" since D put it there and has no information suggesting it was moved.

**Should I take an action?** 
- D is on the Red team. If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.
- I could try to Tell D false information to trick D into giving a wrong answer, but D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team).
- Any Tell or Ask costs my team 0.5 points.

Since D personally put the apple in the box and knows it's there, D is very likely to answer "apple" correctly regardless of anything I say. Trying to deceive D would cost me 0.5 points and is unlikely to work since D has direct knowledge.

The best move is to not spend points on a futile deception attempt.

D answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone is in the room. D puts a banana in the bag.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. After D leaves: C moves the banana from the bag to the box.
5. C puts an orange in the bag.
6. C moves the orange from the bag to the basket.
7. C moves the banana from the box to the bag.

**Current state:** The bag contains a banana, the box is empty, the basket contains an orange.

**What D knows:** D was present when the banana was put in the bag. Then D left. D doesn't know about any of C's rearrangements. So D believes the banana is still in the bag.

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the bag. Wait - no, D will be asked what is in the bag.

D will answer based on what D knows. D last saw the banana placed in the bag, and then left. D would believe the banana is still in the bag. So D would likely answer "banana."

The actual contents of the bag IS a banana (after all of C's moves, the banana ended up back in the bag).

So D's natural answer of "banana" would be **correct**, earning the Red team 1 point.

I need to consider whether I should act. I could tell D wrong information to trick D into giving a wrong answer, but D is on the Red team and might not trust me. However, D doesn't know what happened after leaving, so if I tell D something misleading, D might second-guess their own knowledge.

Let me try to mislead D. If I tell D that the bag contains something else (like an orange), D might think C moved things around and change their answer.

Tell(D, bag, orange)
D answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what each player saw:

**What D saw:**
- Everyone starts in the room
- I put a stapler in the basket
- B leaves the room
- D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag
- C puts a banana in the basket
- D leaves the room

So D knows that when he left, the basket contained a banana (C put it there while D was still in the room). D has full knowledge of the basket's contents.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket. D knows the answer is **banana**.

Since D is on the Red team, D will answer correctly (banana), earning Red 1 point. 

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D was in the room when C put the banana in the basket, so D knows the contents. Any Tell action to D would cost us 0.5 points and D would have no reason to believe misinformation since D saw everything directly.

The best action is to not spend any points.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what I can do to help my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D saw:**
- Everyone starts in the room with empty bag, box, basket
- I put a stapler in the basket
- B leaves the room
- D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag
- C puts a banana in the basket
- D leaves the room (at this point, D knows: stapler in bag, banana in basket, box is empty)

After D leaves, D doesn't see:
- C moves stapler from bag to box
- I move stapler from box to bag
- C moves stapler from bag to box

**So D believes:** stapler in bag, banana in basket, box is empty.

**The actual state:** stapler in box, banana in basket, bag is empty.

**The question is: What is in the basket?**

D believes the basket has a banana, and it actually does have a banana. So D will likely answer correctly (banana), which gives the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell D false information about the basket to try to mislead D. But D is on the Red team - would D trust information from me (an opponent)?

D knows I'm on the opposing team, so D might be suspicious of any Tell action from me. However, if I tell D something about the basket, D might second-guess themselves. 

If I Tell D that the basket contains something other than a banana (like the stapler), D might think things changed after they left. But D might also just ignore me since I'm an opponent.

The risk: Telling costs 0.5 points, and D might ignore it anyway, meaning we lose 0.5 points for nothing. If I Pass, Red gets 1 point (D answers correctly). If I Tell and D believes me and answers wrong, we spend 0.5 but Red doesn't get the point - net benefit of 0.5 for us relatively.

But D is likely to be skeptical of an opponent's information. The expected value of Telling is uncertain. Let me try to mislead D - if there's even a chance D second-guesses, it's worth the 0.5 cost.

Tell(D, basket, stapler)
D answers: banana

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone is in the room. I put a stapler in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (D sees this)
4. C puts a banana in the basket. (D sees this)
5. D leaves the room.
6. I move the stapler from the bag to the box. (D doesn't see this)
7. C moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (D doesn't see this)
8. I move the stapler from the bag to the box. (D doesn't see this)

Current state of the basket: **banana** (placed there in step 4, never moved)

What does D know about the basket?
- D saw C put a banana in the basket (step 4).
- After D left, nothing happened to the basket.
- So D should know the basket contains a banana.

The correct answer is **banana**, and D should know this from their own observations. D is on the Red team, so they'll likely answer correctly on their own.

Since D is on the opposing team, I don't want to help them. But D already knows the answer - the banana was placed in the basket while D was present, and nothing happened to the basket after D left.

There's nothing I can do to hurt the Red team here (I can't communicate misleading info to D in a way that would be believed, since D directly witnessed the banana being placed). Any Tell or Ask would cost my team 0.5 points for no benefit.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a ball in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. ... C puts a banana in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the ball from the bag to the box. ... C moves the banana from the basket to the bag. ... C moves the banana from the bag to the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone is in the room. I put a ball in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. (D knows this)
4. C puts a banana in the basket. (D sees this)
5. D leaves the room.
6. C moves the ball from the bag to the box. (D doesn't see this)
7. C moves the banana from the basket to the bag. (D doesn't see this)
8. C moves the banana from the bag to the basket. (D doesn't see this)

**Current actual state:**
- Basket: banana
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty

**What D believes:**
After D left, D last saw:
- Bag: ball (D moved it there)
- Basket: banana (C put it there)
- Box: empty

D doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So D thinks the basket contains a **banana**.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to D.

The actual answer is banana, and D believes it's banana. So D would likely answer **banana**, which is correct!

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider whether I can mislead D. But D is on the opposing team, and I could try to Tell D incorrect information to confuse them.

If I Tell D that the basket contains something else, D might doubt their own knowledge. But D might also not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. However, it's worth trying since if D answers correctly, Red gets a point.

Let me try to mislead D by telling them the basket contents changed.

Tell(D, basket, ball)

This might make D think the ball was moved back to the basket, causing them to second-guess and potentially answer "ball" (which is wrong).
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- B put a brick in the basket while B, D, and I were all in the room.
- D then left the room.
- Nothing else happened after D left.

**What D knows:**
- D saw B put a brick in the basket (D was in the room when this happened).
- D left the room, but nothing changed after that.

So D knows the basket contains a brick. D is on the Red team, and the question is being asked to D about the basket. D will correctly answer "brick" and the Red team will get 1 point.

**My options:**
- **Pass**: Costs nothing. D will answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.
- **Tell(D, basket, [something wrong])**: I could try to deceive D by telling them something false about the basket. But D was in the room when the brick was placed - D *saw* it happen. D would likely not believe my lie since they have direct knowledge. This would cost 0.5 points AND D would still answer correctly, netting us -0.5 and Red +1.
- **Ask**: No useful ask here.

Since D directly witnessed the brick being placed in the basket, any attempt to deceive D would be futile - D has firsthand knowledge. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell that D would ignore would just hurt our score.

The best action is to not waste points.

Pass
D answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the question will be.

D was in the room when B put a brick in the basket. Then D left the room. After D left, the orange was moved around, but the brick stayed in the basket the entire time.

So D knows:
- B put a brick in the basket (D saw this)
- After D left, D doesn't know what happened, but the basket still contains the brick

The question is: What is in the basket? Asked to D.

D should know the answer is "brick" since D saw B put the brick in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after D left (the movements were all about the orange between the box and bag).

D is on the Red team, so D answering correctly gives the Red team a point. I want D to answer **incorrectly**.

I could Tell D false information to try to mislead them. Since D is on the opposing team, I could tell D that the basket contains something different, hoping D believes me and gives a wrong answer.

After D left, things happened in the room that D couldn't see. So D might believe that the basket contents changed. Let me tell D something false about the basket.

Tell(D, basket, orange)

This might make D think that after they left, the brick was removed and an orange was placed in the basket. D knows an orange and brick were involved (D saw the brick placed), and D knows things happened after they left, so this could be plausible enough to create doubt.

Tell(D, basket, orange)
D answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:
1. A (me), B, and D are all in the room. The bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. B puts a brick in the basket. (Everyone sees this - A, B, and D all know basket has brick)
3. D leaves the room. (D's last knowledge: basket has brick, bag and box are empty)
4. I put a banana in the bag. (D doesn't see this)
5. B moves banana from bag to box. (D doesn't see this)
6. B moves banana from box to bag. (D doesn't see this)
7. I move banana from bag to box. (D doesn't see this)

Current state: basket has brick, box has banana, bag is empty.

D will be asked what's in the basket. D saw the brick being put in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that (the brick is still there). D left the room before any other changes happened, but the basket wasn't touched after D left.

So D should know the basket contains a brick, because:
1. D saw B put the brick in the basket
2. The brick was never moved from the basket

D should answer "brick" correctly on their own. Since D is on the Red team and would score a point for Red if correct, I need to consider whether I should try to mislead D.

D is on the Red team. If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. I could try to Tell D incorrect information to mislead them. But D saw the brick go into the basket themselves, so they might not believe me if I tell them something different.

However, there's a chance D might second-guess themselves if I tell them something different. Let me try to mislead D by telling them the basket contains something else.

Tell(D, basket, banana)
D answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would help my team.

Let me trace through what D saw and knows:

1. D was in the room when B put a banana in the basket.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: B moved the banana from basket to bag, I put a stapler in the basket, B moved the stapler from basket to box, I moved the banana from bag to basket.

So D's last knowledge of the basket is that it contains a **banana** (from step 1). D doesn't know about any of the moves that happened after they left.

The current actual contents of the basket: **banana** (I moved it back there).

So D will likely answer "banana" for the basket, which is actually correct! That would give the Red team 1 point.

I should try to mislead D. I can Tell D incorrect information about the basket to make them change their answer.

If I tell D something false about the basket, D might use that information. But D knows I'm on the opposing team, so D might not trust me. However, if I tell D something that seems plausible given what D knows happened (people were in the room moving things around), D might consider it.

Actually, let me think more carefully. D knows that after they left, things could have changed. If I tell D the basket contains something else, D knows I'm on the Blue team and might distrust me. But if I say nothing (Pass), D will likely guess "banana" which is correct, giving Red a point.

The best play is to try to mislead D. If I tell D the basket contains the stapler (or something else), D might doubt their original knowledge. But since I'm on the opposing team, D might do the opposite of what I say.

This is tricky. If D is strategic, telling D false info might backfire (they'd distrust me and stick with banana) or it might help (they'd second-guess themselves). Telling the truth could also work reverse-psychologically.

If I Pass, D likely answers "banana" correctly → Red gets 1 point.
If I Tell D something false, it costs 0.5 points but might cause D to answer wrong, preventing Red from getting 1 point. Net gain: +0.5 for my team.

I think the attempt to mislead is worth it. I'll tell D the basket contains the stapler, hoping D might believe it or at least become uncertain.

Tell(D, basket, stapler)
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

1. **C was in the room** when I put the banana in the bag.
2. **C left the room** before I moved the banana from the bag to the box, and before I put the stapler in the bag.

So C's last knowledge of the bag is that it contains a **banana**. C doesn't know about the move or the stapler.

The actual contents of the bag is the **stapler**.

C will be asked what's in the bag. C will likely answer "banana" based on their last observation, which is **wrong**. That means Red gets 0 points from this question.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly on their own, I don't need to help them (and shouldn't). I also don't need to spend points on any action here.

However, let me consider if there's any risk. Could D help C? D was in the room the entire time (D never left), so D saw everything - D knows the bag contains the stapler. But it's MY turn, not D's turn. D doesn't get to act right now.

Wait - the action phase says "It is your turn." So only I act now. The question will be asked to C after this. D might get a turn to Tell C the correct answer, but the sequence matters. Let me re-read...

Actually, the structure seems to be: action phase (my turn), then answer phase. If only I get an action before C is asked, then D can't help C.

The best move is to **Pass** - C will likely answer "banana" (wrong), Red gets 0 points, and I don't spend any points.

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and what action would best help my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What C saw before leaving:**
- I put a banana in the bag
- Then C left the room

**So C believes:** bag = banana, box = empty, basket = empty

**What actually happened after C left:**
- I moved banana from bag to box
- I put stapler in bag
- B left
- D moved banana from box to basket
- I moved banana from basket to box
- D moved banana from box to basket

**Current state:** bag = stapler, basket = banana, box = empty

**The question:** C will be asked what's in the bag.

C thinks the bag has a banana (since that's what was there when C left). The actual answer is **stapler**.

C is on the Red team. If C answers "banana" (what C believes), that's wrong - Red gets 0 points. That's good for us.

If I Pass, C will likely answer "banana" which is incorrect. Red gets 0 points.

If I Tell C the truth (stapler), C would score 1 point for Red, which is bad for us. If I tell C something false, C might get confused but could still answer wrong.

The best strategy is to **Pass** - C doesn't know the bag's contents changed, and will likely answer incorrectly with "banana."

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. I put a banana in the bag (everyone sees: A, B, C, D all in room)
2. C leaves the room
3. I move banana from bag to box (C doesn't see this; A, B, D see it)
4. I put a stapler in the bag (C doesn't see this; A, B, D see it)
5. B leaves the room
6. D moves banana from box to basket (A, D see it)
7. D moves banana from basket to box (A, D see it)

**Current state:** Bag has stapler, Box has banana, Basket is empty.

**What C knows:** C saw the banana go into the bag, then left. C doesn't know about any changes after that. So C likely thinks the bag still has a banana.

**The question is: What is in the bag?** Asked to C.

C is on the Red team. C will likely answer "banana" (what they last saw). The correct answer is "stapler." So C will likely get it wrong, which is good for us (Blue team).

Now, should I Tell C the correct answer? No! C is on the opposing team. If I tell C "the bag has a stapler," C might use that information to answer correctly, earning Red a point.

Should I Tell C wrong information? That costs 0.5 points. C already likely believes the bag has a banana (which is wrong), so telling C wrong info is unnecessary.

Should I tell C the bag has a banana (reinforcing their wrong belief)? That costs 0.5 points but C already thinks that, so it's wasteful.

Could D tell C the truth? D is on C's team and D knows the stapler is in the bag (D was present when I put it there). But it's MY turn, not D's turn. So D can't act right now.

The best action is to **Pass**. C will likely answer "banana" (incorrect), Red gets no points, and we don't spend any points.

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and what would help my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**C's perspective:**
- C was in the room initially and saw me put an apple in the box.
- C then left the room.
- After C left: B moved apple from box to basket, D moved apple from basket to box, I moved apple from box to bag, I put a stapler in the box, B left the room.
- C didn't see any of these moves after leaving.
- So C thinks the apple is still in the box.

**The actual state:** The box contains a stapler.

**The question:** C will be asked what's in the box. C thinks it's the apple, so C will likely answer "apple," which is **wrong**. That's good for my team (Blue) since C is on the Red team.

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room the entire time and saw everything.
- D knows the box contains a stapler.
- D could potentially Tell C the correct answer.

**My concern:** D is on C's team and might Tell C the correct contents before C answers. But right now it's MY turn, not D's turn.

**Should I do anything?** 
- If I Tell C something, I could try to mislead C, but C already has the wrong answer (apple), so misleading further might not help or could accidentally correct them.
- If I Tell C the truth (stapler), that would hurt my team.
- If I Tell C something wrong, C might get confused but C already has a wrong belief.

The risk is that D might get a turn before C answers and Tell C the truth. But I can't prevent that.

The best action is to **Pass** - C already has the wrong information, and any action I take either costs points or risks accidentally helping C. I should save my points.

Pass
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Since D is on the Red team, if D answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point. D will likely answer "apple" (which is wrong), so the Red team won't score. This is good for me.

However, I need to consider whether C might use their turn to Tell D the correct answer. C is on the Red team and saw everything - C knows the basket has an orange. If C gets a turn before the answer phase, C could Tell D the truth.

But right now it's MY turn. Should I try to interfere? 

If I Tell D false information, it costs me 0.5 points. But D already has wrong information (thinks it's an apple). If C later tells D it's an orange, my false tell won't help. If I tell D something wrong, D might get confused but C's correction would likely override mine.

The best play is to **Pass**. D already has incorrect information (thinks it's the apple). Spending 0.5 points to tell D something false is wasteful since D is already going to answer incorrectly. I should save my points.

Pass
D answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an apple in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the apple from the basket to the bag. ... C puts an orange in the basket. ... You move the apple from the bag to the box. ... C moves the apple from the box to the bag. ... You move the apple from the bag to the box. ...

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the optimal action is.

**What D knows:** D was in the room when the apple was put in the basket, then D left. After D left, various moves happened that D is unaware of. D knows B left after them, but D doesn't know about any object movements after leaving.

So D believes: **apple is in the basket**.

**What's actually in the basket:** After D left, C moved the apple from basket to bag, then C put an orange in the basket. The apple was moved around more, but the orange stayed in the basket.

So the **basket contains an orange**, but D thinks it contains an **apple**.

**The question is for D (Red team).** If D answers "apple," they'll be wrong, and Red gets 0 points. That's good for us.

**Should I Tell D the truth?** No! That would cost us 0.5 points AND help the Red team score 1 point. 

**Should I Tell D a lie?** D already has the wrong answer, so there's no need. Telling D anything risks either helping them (if I tell the truth) or is unnecessary (if I lie, they already have a wrong answer). Plus it costs 0.5 points.

**Should I Pass?** Yes. D will likely answer "apple" (wrong), costing Red nothing but gaining nothing. We lose nothing.

Pass
D answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- D put an apple in the basket, then left the room.
- After D left, C moved things around. The final state is:
  - Bag: apple
  - Box: empty
  - Basket: orange

**What D knows:**
- D saw themselves put an apple in the basket, then left.
- D knows B left after them, but D doesn't know what happened inside the room after they left.
- D would believe the basket still contains the apple (unless someone tells them otherwise).

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket.

**D's likely answer:** D will probably say "apple" since that's what they last saw in the basket. But the correct answer is "orange."

**Strategy considerations:**
- D is on the Red team (my opponent). If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.
- If D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points.
- D currently believes the basket has an apple, which is wrong. The basket actually has an orange.

**Should I act?**
- If I Pass, D will likely say "apple" (wrong). Red gets 0 points. This is good for my team.
- If I Tell D the truth, Red scores 1 point. Bad for me.
- If I Tell D a lie, it might confuse them but they'd still likely guess wrong. Costs me 0.5 points for no benefit.
- C is D's teammate and was in the room. C knows the basket has an orange. But C doesn't get an action right now - it's my turn.

Wait - but C saw everything and is on D's team. C might tell D the correct answer on C's turn. But for now, it's my turn, and I should not help D.

The best action is to Pass, keeping D uninformed so they answer incorrectly.

Pass
D answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team (Blue) score points.

Let me trace through what D knows:
- D was in the room initially and put a banana in the basket
- D left the room
- After D left: B moved banana from basket to bag, C moved banana from bag to basket, B left, C moved banana from basket to box, C put orange in basket
- D doesn't know about any of these moves since D was outside the room

So D thinks the banana is still in the basket (since that's where D left it).

The question is: "What is in the basket?" - asked to D.

The actual contents of the basket: **orange**

D will likely answer **banana** (since that's what D last knew was there).

D is on the Red team. If D answers correctly, Red gets a point. If D answers incorrectly, Red gets nothing.

Since D doesn't know the basket now contains an orange, D will likely say "banana" - which is wrong. This is good for my team!

Now, should I take an action? 

- If I Tell D the truth (that the basket contains an orange), D would answer correctly and Red gets 1 point. That's bad for me, and it costs me 0.5 points too.
- If I Tell D false information, it costs 0.5 points but D might already be wrong anyway. D is likely to say "banana" which is already wrong.
- If I Pass, it costs nothing and D will likely answer "banana" (wrong), which means Red gets 0 points.

The best action is to Pass - D is already going to get it wrong, and any action costs my team 0.5 points.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D saw before leaving:**
- I put a banana in the bag
- Then C left the room
- Then D left the room

**After D left (D doesn't know about these):**
- I moved the banana from the bag to the box
- B put a ball in the bag

So D thinks the bag still contains the **banana** (since D left before I moved it and before B added the ball).

The question is: **What is in the bag?** asked to D.

The actual contents of the bag is a **ball**.

D will likely answer **banana** (based on what D last saw), which is **wrong**. This is good for us (Blue team) since D is on the Red team.

If I Pass, D will answer "banana" and get it wrong → Red gets 0 points, Blue gets 0 points.

If I Tell D the truth (that the bag contains a ball), it costs us 0.5 points but D would get 1 point for Red. Net for Red: +1. Net for Blue: -0.5. That's bad.

If I Tell D a lie, it costs us 0.5 points but D might use the wrong info. But D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

The best action is to **Pass**. D will likely answer "banana" based on their last observation, which is incorrect. We lose nothing and Red gains nothing.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be best for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room. I put a banana in the bag. Everyone sees this.
2. C leaves the room. (C knows banana is in the bag at this point)
3. D leaves the room. (D knows banana is in the bag at this point)
4. After both C and D leave:
   - I move banana from bag to box
   - B puts a ball in the bag
   - I move banana from box to basket
   - B moves banana from basket to box
   - I move banana from box to basket

Current state: **banana is in the basket, ball is in the bag.**

D's perspective: D left when the banana was in the bag. D doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So D likely thinks the banana is still in the bag.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" directed at D.

D will likely answer "banana" (which is wrong - the bag actually contains a ball). If D answers wrong, Red gets 0 points. That's good for us.

However, D might receive information from C or from a Tell action before answering. But C also left the room (C left before D), so C doesn't know about the ball either. C would also think the banana is in the bag.

If I Pass, D will likely answer "banana" which is incorrect. Red gets 0 points, Blue gets 0 points. 

If I Tell D the truth (ball is in the bag), it costs us 0.5 points but helps Red score 1 point. Net: Red +1, Blue -0.5. Bad for us.

If I Tell D a lie, it costs us 0.5 points. That's bad with no benefit since D is already likely to answer wrong.

The best action is to Pass and let D answer incorrectly.

D answers: banana

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D saw before leaving:**
- I put a banana in the bag
- Then C left the room
- Then D left the room

So D's last knowledge of the room state is:
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: empty

**What actually happened after D left:**
- I moved the banana from the bag to the box
- B put a ball in the bag
- B moved the banana from the box to the basket
- I moved the banana from the basket to the box

**Current actual state:**
- Bag: ball
- Box: banana
- Basket: empty

**D will be asked what's in the bag.** D last saw the banana being put in the bag, and left before any changes. So D will likely answer "banana" for the bag.

The correct answer is "ball" in the bag. D will answer incorrectly (saying "banana"), which means Red gets 0 points. This is good for us.

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer wrong, I should **not** help D. I should also consider whether telling D anything could hurt us. If I tell D the truth, that helps Red. If I tell D a lie, it costs us 0.5 points but D might already be wrong anyway.

The best action is to Pass - D will likely answer "banana" which is wrong, Red scores 0, and we don't spend any points.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be most beneficial for my team.

Let me trace through what each player saw:

1. **Everyone in room**: I put a brick in the box.
2. **C leaves the room** - C last saw: brick in box.
3. **D leaves the room** - D last saw: brick in box.
4. After both C and D left: I moved the brick from box to basket, B moved it from basket to box, I moved it from box to bag, B put a ball in the box.

So **D's last knowledge** is that the brick is in the box. D doesn't know about any movements after leaving.

The **actual current state**: bag has the brick, box has the ball, basket is empty.

The question is: **What is in the box?** asked to D.

D will likely answer "brick" (based on what D last saw). The correct answer is "ball." So D will likely get it wrong, which means Red doesn't score.

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly on their own, I don't need to do anything. If I Tell D the correct answer, that would help the Red team score (bad for us). If I Tell D a wrong answer, D might already be giving a wrong answer anyway, so it's wasted points.

I should Pass to save points.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and whether I should try to influence C's answer.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. The bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. D puts an apple in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves the apple from the box to the bag. (A, C, D see this.)
5. D puts a ball in the box. (A, C, D see this.)
6. A leaves the room.

So at this point:
- The bag contains the apple.
- The box contains the ball.
- The basket is empty.

C was in the room the entire time, so C saw everything. C knows the box contains the ball.

Since C is on the Red team, C will answer correctly when asked what's in the box. C knows it's the ball, and answering correctly gives the Red team 1 point.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly. I could try to Tell C false information, but C was in the room the whole time and saw everything directly - C has no reason to believe my misinformation over their own observations.

The best action is to Pass, since spending 0.5 points on an Ask or Tell would be wasteful here.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through the events:

1. D puts an apple in the box. → Box: apple
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the apple from the box to the bag. → Box: empty, Bag: apple
4. D puts a ball in the box. → Box: ball
5. D moves the apple from the bag to the basket. → Bag: empty, Basket: apple
6. I move the apple from the basket to the bag. → Basket: empty, Bag: apple
7. D moves the apple from the bag to the basket. → Bag: empty, Basket: apple
8. I leave the room.

So at the time I left, the box contains a **ball**.

C was in the room the entire time and saw everything. C and D are both on the Red team. The question is being asked to C: "What is in the box?"

C knows the box contains a ball. Since C is on the Red team, C will answer correctly and score 1 point for Red.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly - C was in the room the whole time and saw everything. Any Tell action to C would cost us 0.5 points and C has no reason to believe misinformation from me (an opponent). An Ask action would also cost 0.5 points with no benefit.

9. I move the apple from the bag to the basket. → Box: ball, Bag: empty, Basket: apple
10. D moves the apple from the basket to the bag. → Box: ball, Bag: apple, Basket: empty
11. I leave the room.

At the time I left, the box contained a **ball**. C was in the room the entire time and saw everything I saw, so C knows the box contains a ball.

The question is being asked to C (Red team). C knows the answer is "ball." C will likely answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.

Now, should I take an action? 

- I could try to Tell C wrong information, but C was in the room the whole time and saw everything, so C won't be fooled.
- I could try to help B for future rounds, but there's no immediate benefit.
- Any Ask or Tell costs 0.5 points.

Since C knows the correct answer and won't be misled by anything I say, there's no benefit to spending 0.5 points.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the bag. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. ... C enters the room. ... D puts an apple in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the bag to the box. ... D puts a ball in the bag. ... You leave the room. ... B enters the room. ... B leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether C knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) in room. D puts stapler in bag.
2. C leaves the room.
3. D moves stapler from bag to basket. (C doesn't see this)
4. C enters the room.
5. D puts apple in bag. (C sees this)
6. B leaves the room.
7. D moves stapler from bag to box. (Wait - the stapler is in the basket, not the bag. Let me re-read.)

Wait, let me re-trace:
1. D puts stapler in bag. **Bag: stapler**
2. C leaves.
3. D moves stapler from bag to basket. **Bag: empty, Basket: stapler**
4. C enters. (C thinks bag has stapler, basket is empty - but C missed the move)
5. D puts apple in bag. **Bag: apple, Basket: stapler**
6. B leaves.
7. D moves the stapler from the bag to the box. Wait - the stapler is in the basket, not the bag. 

Hmm, but the scenario says "D moves the stapler from the bag to the box." Let me re-read... Actually, step 5 says "D puts an apple in the bag." So bag has apple. But step 7 says "D moves the stapler from the bag to the box." The stapler is in the basket at this point, not the bag. 

I need to take the scenario at face value. Let me re-read step 7: "D moves the stapler from the bag to the box." Maybe I misread. Let me recheck: after step 5, bag has apple, basket has stapler. Step 7 says stapler moves from bag to box - but stapler is in basket. Perhaps the scenario text is authoritative regardless. Let me just accept: **D moves stapler to box, puts ball in bag.**

After step 8: Bag: ball, Box: stapler, Basket: empty (or apple somewhere).

Actually, maybe step 7 is "D moves the **apple** from the bag to the box"? No, it clearly says stapler. Let me just accept the literal text and figure out what C thinks.

C was present for steps 5 onward (after re-entering at step 4). C saw: apple put in bag, then B leaves, then "D moves stapler from bag to box", then "D puts ball in bag." 

So C believes the bag contains a **ball**.

The actual bag contains a **ball** (after D put ball in bag, and nothing else happened to it after).

So C likely knows the correct answer: **ball**.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly, I should Pass to avoid spending points unnecessarily.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------

I am going to ask C what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a stapler in the basket (I saw this)
- I put a brick in the box (I did this)
- I then left the room
- After I left, things may have happened that I'm not aware of

**What C knows:**
- C was in the room the entire time, so C saw B put the stapler in the basket and me put the brick in the box
- C also saw anything that happened after I left the room

**The question:** C will be asked what's in the basket.

Since C is on the Red team, C was present for everything and knows the basket contains the stapler (unless something changed after I left). C has every incentive to answer correctly since it earns the Red team a point.

**Can I do anything to prevent C from answering correctly?**

If I use Tell, I could try to deceive C about the basket's contents. But C was in the room the whole time and saw the stapler go into the basket. C would know I'm lying since C has direct knowledge.

However, things might have changed after I left. If someone moved the stapler after I left, C would know about it (C was still in the room). So C definitely knows the current contents of the basket.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from knowing the correct answer - C has perfect information about the basket. Any Tell action would cost 0.5 points and C would just ignore my misinformation since C has firsthand knowledge. An Ask action would also cost 0.5 points and give me no strategic advantage here.

The best move is to not waste points.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a stapler in the basket (I saw this)
- I put an orange in the box (I did this)
- I then left the room
- After I left, things may or may not have happened that I'm unaware of

**What C knows:**
- C was in the room the entire time, so C saw B put the stapler in the basket and me put the orange in the box
- C also saw anything that happened after I left the room

Since C was in the room the whole time, C knows exactly what's in the basket. C is on the Red team, so when asked "what is in the basket?", C will answer correctly (it earns Red 1 point if correct).

The question is: can I do anything to prevent C from answering correctly or to gain an advantage?

If I **Tell** C false information, C won't be fooled because C was in the room the entire time and saw everything. C knows the truth.

If I **Ask** someone about the basket, it costs 0.5 points and doesn't help me prevent C from answering correctly.

Since C was present for everything and knows the contents of the basket (whether it's still the stapler or if something changed after I left), there's nothing I can do to influence C's answer. Any action I take would cost 0.5 points with no benefit.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events from C's perspective:

1. Everyone is in the room. B puts a brick in the basket. (C sees this)
2. C leaves the room. (C misses what happens next)
3. I move the brick from the basket to the box. (C doesn't see this)
4. C enters the room. (C is back)
5. D puts a banana in the basket. (C sees this)
6. I leave the room.

So the basket currently contains: a banana (the brick was moved to the box, and then D put a banana in the basket).

From C's perspective:
- C saw the brick go into the basket
- C left and missed the brick being moved to the box
- C came back and saw D put a banana in the basket
- C knows the basket can only hold one object, so C might think the brick was removed at some point (since D put a banana in), or C might be confused

Wait - the problem says "Each container can hold at most one object." So when D puts a banana in the basket, C would know the basket now has a banana. But C might wonder what happened to the brick. Since C was gone when the brick was moved, C might think the brick was removed to make room for the banana, or C might just know the banana is there now since D put it in.

Actually, C saw D put a banana in the basket. C knows the basket holds the banana. The correct answer is "banana."

C is on the Red team, so C answering correctly gives Red a point. I want C to answer incorrectly.

I could try to Tell C misleading information. But C directly saw D put the banana in the basket, so C likely knows the basket contains a banana. It would be hard to deceive C about something they directly witnessed.

Since C witnessed D putting the banana in the basket, C almost certainly knows the answer is "banana" and will answer correctly regardless of what I say. Any Tell action would cost 0.5 points and likely not change C's answer.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.
