SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a brick in the basket. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. ... C leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. There's an empty bag, empty box, empty basket.
2. D puts a brick in the basket. → Basket has brick.
3. ... I leave the room. → I don't see what happens while I'm out.
4. ... I enter the room. → I can now see what happens again.
5. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. → This tells me that while I was out, the brick was moved to the bag (I didn't see this). Now C moves it from the bag back to the basket. → Basket has brick.
6. C leaves the room.

So based on what I observed, after step 5, the brick is in the basket. 

But wait - I need to consider what might have happened after C left. The scenario says "C leaves the room. ..." with ellipsis, meaning time passes. During that time, B and D are still in the room with me. But the scenario doesn't describe any further actions, so nothing else happened.

Actually, let me re-read: "C leaves the room. ..." - the ellipsis is at the end. The scenario ends there. So the current state is: the brick is in the basket.

I'm confident the basket contains the brick. I don't need to spend points asking anyone.

Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to think carefully about what I observed.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. The bag, box, and basket are all empty.
2. C puts a ball in the basket. (I see this.)
3. I leave the room. (While I'm outside, I can't see what happens inside, but I know if anyone enters/leaves.)
4. I enter the room. (No one else entered or left while I was gone, as far as I know.)
5. C moves the ball from the **bag** to the basket. (I see this.)

Wait - step 5 says C moves the ball from the **bag** to the basket. But when I left, the ball was in the basket. This means that while I was outside the room, someone must have moved the ball from the basket to the bag. Then when I returned, C moved it from the bag back to the basket.

So the current state is: the ball is in the basket.

Since I'm being asked what is in the basket, and I witnessed C move the ball from the bag to the basket as the last action, I know the ball is in the basket.

I don't need to ask anyone anything. I'll save the 0.5 points.

Action: Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone starts in the room. B leaves, then C leaves.
2. I put a brick in the basket. (Only D and I see this.)
3. B enters, then C enters.
4. I leave the room. B leaves. C leaves.
5. I enter the room.
6. D moves the apple from the basket to the bag. (Wait - I put a brick in the basket, but D moves an "apple" from the basket? Let me re-read...)

Hmm, the scenario says "D moves the apple from the basket to the bag" and then "D moves the apple from the bag to the basket." This is interesting - I put a brick in the basket, but D is moving an "apple." These could be separate objects, but a container can only hold one object. Let me reconsider.

Actually, since each container holds at most one object, when D moves the apple from the basket to the bag, the brick must have been replaced or... Actually, the scenario describes what I see. If D moved "the apple from the basket to the bag," that means somehow there was an apple in the basket. But I put a brick there. 

Wait - between when I left and re-entered, things could have happened that I didn't see. Let me re-check: I left, then B left, C left, then I entered. During the time I was out, B and C were still in (briefly). Someone could have swapped the brick for an apple while I was gone.

But actually, when I re-entered, I would observe the current state. The scenario then shows D moving "the apple from the basket to the bag" - so apparently the basket contained an apple when I was watching. This means someone replaced the brick with an apple while I was out.

Then D moves the apple from bag back to basket. So the basket contains the apple.

Then D leaves, D enters, I leave, B enters, B leaves.

After I left, D was in the room and could have done something. B entered and could have done something. But I wouldn't know about changes after I left.

The last state I know: the basket contains the apple (from what I observed). But things could have changed after I left.

Since I'm being asked what's in the basket, and my last known information is that the apple is in the basket, I'll go with that.

Pass
A answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C leaves the room. ... D puts a ball in the bag. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... D moves the ball from the bag to the box. ... B moves the ball from the box to the bag. ... You leave the room. ... D leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events:

1. **All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.** Containers are empty.
2. **C leaves the room.**
3. **D puts a ball in the bag.** (I see this - I'm in the room)
4. **I leave the room.** (Ball is in the bag when I leave)
5. **I enter the room.** (I don't know what happened while I was out, but now I can see what happens)
6. **D moves the ball from the bag to the box.** (I see this)
7. **B moves the ball from the box to the bag.** (I see this)
8. **I leave the room.** (Ball is in the bag when I leave)
9. **D leaves the room.**

So when I left the second time, the ball was in the bag. But after I left, things could have happened before D left. Wait - let me re-read the scenario.

After "You leave the room" the next event is "D leaves the room." The scenario describes what I can observe. Since I'm outside the room, I can only see people entering/leaving. B is still in the room after I leave, and D is still in the room until D leaves.

Between my leaving and D leaving, B and D are both in the room. Something could have happened that I wouldn't know about. But the scenario only shows me what I can observe - so if something happened while I was outside, it wouldn't be described to me.

So I don't know for certain what's in the bag now. When I left, the ball was in the bag, but B and D were still in the room and could have moved things.

B is my teammate and was in the room the entire time (B never left). B knows exactly what's in every container. I should ask B.

Ask(B, bag)
A answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

2. I leave the room. (Things may happen that I don't see.)

After step 8, I left the room. I don't know if anything happened after I left. The question asks me what is in the basket. When I last saw, the stapler was in the basket. But something could have changed after I left.

B is still in the room (B entered in step 7 and I didn't see B leave after that). So B would know the current state of the basket. Let me ask B.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room.
2. B puts a brick in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens.)
4. D leaves the room.
5. C puts a ball in the bag.
6. I (A) move the ball from the bag to the box.
7. C moves the ball from the box to the bag.

So the current state is:
- Basket: brick (unchanged since B put it there)
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty

B knows:
- B put a brick in the basket (B saw this).
- After B left, B doesn't know about any changes.
- The brick was never moved from the basket, so it's still there.

B will be asked what's in the basket. B knows they put a brick in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that (even though B left, the basket was never touched again). So B should correctly answer "brick."

Since B already knows the correct answer (brick is in the basket, and B placed it there), I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

The question is: "What is in the basket?"

Let me trace through what B knows:
1. B was in the room and put a brick in the basket.
2. B left the room.
3. After B left: D left, C put an apple in the bag, I moved the apple from bag to box, C moved apple from box to bag, I moved apple from bag to box.

B doesn't know about any of the movements after leaving, but B does know that they put a brick in the basket. Since nothing happened to the basket after B left (all the movements involved the bag and box), the brick is still in the basket.

So B knows the brick is in the basket, and the brick IS in the basket. B should answer correctly without any help from me.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a banana in the basket.
3. B leaves the room.
4. C moves the banana from the basket to the bag.
5. D puts an orange in the basket.
6. C moves the orange from the basket to the box.
7. D moves the banana from the bag to the basket.
8. D leaves the room.

So the current state is:
- Basket: banana
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty

B left the room after putting the banana in the basket. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. B would think the banana is still in the basket.

So when asked "what is in the basket?", B would likely answer "banana" — which is actually correct! The banana ended up back in the basket after D moved it there.

Wait, let me verify: D moved the banana from the bag to the basket in step 7. So yes, the basket contains a banana.

B's last knowledge was putting the banana in the basket (step 2), and B would naturally answer "banana." Since the banana is indeed in the basket now, B would answer correctly without any help from me.

I should Pass to save the 0.5 points, since B's natural answer would be correct.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an apple in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the apple from the box to the bag. ... B puts a brick in the box. ... B leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the box.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

B was in the room when:
1. D put an apple in the box
2. D left the room
3. B moved the apple from the box to the bag
4. B put a brick in the box
5. B left the room

After B left, nothing else happened. So B knows that the box contains a brick (since B put it there).

Since B will be asked what's in the box, and B knows the answer is a brick, B can answer correctly without my help.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

B was in the room when:
1. D put an apple in the box
2. D left the room
3. B moved the apple from the box to the bag
4. B put a brick in the box
5. B left the room

After B left, I moved the apple around, but the box still contains the brick that B put there. Nobody moved the brick.

So B knows the box contains a brick, because B put it there and nothing happened to the box before B left. B has no reason to think the brick was moved after leaving.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B. The answer is a brick, and B knows this.

B should answer correctly on their own, so I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

B was in the room when:
- D put an apple in the box
- B moved the apple from the box to the bag
- B put a brick in the box
- Then B left the room

After B left, I moved the apple around, but the box wasn't touched. So the brick is still in the box.

B knows that when they left, the brick was in the box. Since B has been outside the room since then, B doesn't know if anything changed in the box after they left. But in fact, nothing did change in the box - the brick is still there.

So B should correctly answer "brick" when asked what's in the box. B has accurate knowledge here.

I'll Pass since B already knows the correct answer.

B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room.
2. D puts a banana in the bag.
3. D leaves the room.
4. B moves the banana from the bag to the box.
5. B puts a brick in the bag.
6. B leaves the room.
7. C moves the banana from the box to the basket.
8. C moves the brick from the bag to the box.
9. C moves the brick from the box to the bag.

**Current state of the bag: brick**

**What B knows about the bag:**
- B was present for steps 1-5, then left at step 6.
- When B left, the bag contained a brick (B put it there).
- After B left, C moved the brick from the bag to the box, then back to the bag.
- B doesn't know about steps 7-9 since B was outside the room.
- So B believes the bag contains a brick.

B's belief about the bag is **brick**, and the actual contents of the bag is also **brick**. So B would answer correctly on their own!

Since B already knows the correct answer, I should Pass to avoid spending 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B needs help answering the question about the basket.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room initially and saw me put an apple in the basket.
2. B then left the room.
3. After B left, D put a stapler in the box, I moved the stapler to the bag, and D moved the stapler back to the box. But none of this affected the basket.

So B saw me put the apple in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that. B should know the basket contains the apple.

Since B already knows the correct answer (apple is in the basket), there's no need to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A (me), B, and D are in the room. I put a banana in the basket.
2. B leaves the room. (B last saw: banana in basket)
3. After B leaves: D moves banana from basket to bag. D puts brick in basket. D moves brick from basket to box. D moves banana from bag to basket.

So the current state is:
- Basket: banana
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty

B was present when I put the banana in the basket, then B left. B doesn't know about any of the moves D made after leaving. So B would think the basket still contains the banana.

The question is asking B what's in the basket. B's last knowledge is that the banana is in the basket, which happens to also be the correct current state (banana is in the basket).

So B would naturally answer "banana" which is correct! No need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I saw everything since I was in the room the whole time.
- Bag: brick (C moved it there)
- Basket: ball (D put it there)
- Box: empty

**What B knows:** B put a brick in the basket, then left. B didn't see anything after leaving. So B thinks:
- Basket: brick
- Bag: empty
- Box: empty

B doesn't know that C moved the brick to the bag, or that D put a ball in the basket.

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the basket. B thinks the basket contains the brick, but it actually contains the ball.

I should tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer gives us 1 point, so we'd net +0.5 points.

2. B puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens inside.)

6. C moves the stapler from the basket to the box. (B doesn't see this.)
7. D puts a ball in the basket. (B doesn't see this.)
8. D leaves the room.

Current state:
- Bag: empty
- Box: stapler
- Basket: ball

B's knowledge: B last saw the stapler placed in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. B would think the basket still contains the stapler.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to B.

B will likely answer "stapler" (based on what B last knew), but the correct answer is "ball."

Since B is my teammate, I want B to answer correctly to earn 1 point for our team. I should tell B what's in the basket.

The cost of a Tell action is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points. If I pass, B will likely say "stapler" which is wrong, gaining 0 points.

So the optimal action is to tell B the correct contents of the basket.

Tell(B, basket, ball)

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**Me (A):** I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything:
- D put a banana in the bag
- C left the room
- B left the room
- D moved the banana from the bag to the box
- D put a brick in the bag
- So: bag = brick, box = banana, basket = empty

**B:** B saw D put a banana in the bag, then B left the room. B did NOT see D move the banana to the box or put a brick in the bag. So B thinks the bag still contains a banana.

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the bag. The correct answer is **brick**.

B thinks the bag contains a banana (which is wrong). If I don't tell B, B will likely answer "banana" and our team gets 0 points.

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and earn us 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer gives us 1 point, netting +0.5 points. If I pass, we get 0 points.

Tell(B, bag, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room. D puts a banana in the bag.
2. C leaves the room. (C knows: banana in bag)
3. B leaves the room. (B knows: banana in bag)
4. D moves banana from bag to box. (Only A and D see this)
5. D puts a brick in the bag. (Only A and D see this)
6. I move banana from box to basket. (Only A and D see this)
7. D moves banana from basket to box. (Only A and D see this)
8. I move banana from box to basket. (Only A and D see this)

Current state:
- **Bag**: brick
- **Box**: empty
- **Basket**: banana

B was asked what's in the bag. B left when the banana was in the bag, so B thinks the bag still contains the banana. B would answer "banana" which is **wrong** (the bag has a brick).

I need to tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly.

2. C leaves the room. (A, B, D remain)
3. B leaves the room. (A, D remain)

7. D moves banana from basket to box. (Only A and D see this)

Final state:
- Bag: brick

What B knows:
- B saw D put banana in bag (step 1)
- B left after step 2, so B doesn't know about any changes after that
- B would think the bag still contains a banana

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B.

The correct answer is **brick**. B thinks the bag has a banana (based on what B last saw), so B will likely answer "banana," which is wrong.

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I saw everything. The bag currently contains a ball, the box contains a banana, and the basket is empty.

**What B knows:** B saw the banana put in the bag, then left. B doesn't know about D moving the banana to the box or C putting a ball in the bag. So B thinks the bag still contains a banana.

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the bag. The correct answer is "a ball."

B will likely answer "banana" based on their outdated knowledge, which is wrong. My team (Blue) needs B to answer correctly to get 1 point.

2. B puts an apple in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (From this point, B doesn't see what happens inside.)

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the bag.

Let me trace through B's perspective:
1. B is in the room and puts a ball in the bag. B knows: bag has a ball.
2. B leaves the room.
3. While B is outside: C moves the ball from the bag to the box. B doesn't see this.
4. B enters the room. B doesn't know what changed while away.
5. C puts a brick in the bag. B sees this happen. So B now knows a brick was put in the bag.

Wait - does B know the brick is in the bag? B saw C put a brick in the bag. But B might think the ball is still in the bag too... except each container holds at most one object. So if C puts a brick in the bag, B might wonder what happened to the ball.

Actually, B saw C put a brick in the bag while B was present. B knows containers hold at most one object. So B might reason that the ball was removed from the bag at some point while B was outside (since C was able to put a brick in the bag). But B doesn't know where the ball went.

The key question: does B know what's in the bag? B saw C put a brick in the bag, so B should know the bag contains a brick.

Actually, B should correctly answer "brick" for the bag. B witnessed C putting a brick in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. So B should know the answer.

Since B likely knows the correct answer (brick), I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

- Box: stapler
- Bag: empty

B was present for all of these events, so B knows the basket contains a ball.

Since B already knows the correct answer (ball is in the basket), I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a stapler in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... B moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. ... You put a ball in the basket. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the box. ... B moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the box. ... B moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a stapler in the basket. (All four players see this)
2. D leaves the room.
3. C leaves the room.
4. B moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (Both A and B see this)
5. I put a ball in the basket. (Both A and B see this)
6. I move the stapler from the bag to the box. (Both A and B see this)
7. B moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (Both A and B see this)
8. I move the stapler from the bag to the box. (Both A and B see this)
9. B moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (Both A and B see this)

So the current state is:
- **Basket**: ball
- **Bag**: stapler
- **Box**: empty

B was present for everything after D and C left, so B knows exactly what's in the basket. The ball was put in the basket in step 5, and nothing was moved out of the basket after that. B should know the basket contains a ball.

Since B already knows the correct answer (ball is in the basket), there's no need to spend 0.5 points telling B.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put an orange in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the orange from the basket to the bag. ... B enters the room. ... D moves the orange from the bag to the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... B moves the orange from the basket to the box. ... You put a ball in the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what I should do.

Let me trace through what B has seen:

1. B was in the room initially and saw me put an orange in the basket.
2. B leaves the room - B misses C moving the orange from basket to bag.
3. B enters the room - B misses nothing else while outside (just C's move).
4. B sees D move the orange from the bag to the basket. (B might be confused about how it got in the bag, but B sees this happen.)
5. B sees D leave the room.
6. B sees C leave the room.
7. B moves the orange from the basket to the box. (B did this themselves.)
8. B sees me put a ball in the basket.

So B knows:
- B moved the orange from the basket to the box.
- I put a ball in the basket.

B knows the basket contains a **ball**.

Since B was present for both of these actions (B moved the orange to the box, and B saw me put the ball in the basket), B should know the correct answer.

The question is "what is in the basket?" and the answer is "ball." B knows this already since B was in the room when I put the ball in the basket.

I should Pass to save points, since B already has the correct information.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: Looking at this situation, I need to figure out if B knows what's in the bag, and whether I need to help.

Let me trace through what happened:
- All three of us (A, B, D) were in the room the entire time.
- D put a stapler in the bag — B saw this.
- D put an orange in the basket — B saw this.
- B moved the orange from the basket to the box — B did this.
- I moved the orange from the box to the basket — B saw this.

So B was present for everything, including D putting the stapler in the bag. B knows the bag contains the stapler.

Since B already knows the answer, there's no need to spend 0.5 points telling or asking anything.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B needs help.

Let me trace through what B saw:

1. B is in the room initially. D puts a ball in the bag. **B sees this.**
2. B leaves the room. D moves the ball from the bag to the box. **B does NOT see this.**
3. B enters the room. D moves the ball from the box to the bag. **B sees this.**

So when B re-enters, B sees D move the ball from the box to the bag. At this point, B knows the ball is in the bag.

But wait - does B know it's the *same* ball? B saw a ball go into the bag initially. Then B left. When B returns, B sees D move a ball from the box to the bag. B would know the ball is now in the bag.

The question is: what is in the bag? The answer is "ball," and B saw D move the ball into the bag in step 3. So B should know the correct answer.

Since B already knows the ball is in the bag, I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B.

B answers: ball

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what B needs to know to answer correctly.

B left the room first, before anything was placed in any container. So B has no knowledge of what's in any container.

The current state of the room:
- Basket: stapler (D put it there, and it was never moved)
- Bag: banana (I moved it back from the box to the bag)
- Box: empty

Since B will be asked what's in the basket, and B has no idea, I should tell B.

- **Basket**: stapler (put there by D in step 3, never moved)
- **Bag**: banana (moved there by D in step 7)
- **Box**: empty

B left the room before any objects were placed, so B has no idea what's in any container. I need to tell B what's in the basket.

Action: The brick was placed in the basket while everyone (A, B, C, D) was in the room. B saw this happen. After that, I left the room, then B left the room.

However, after both A and B left, C and D were still in the room and could have moved the brick or done something else. B wouldn't know about any changes that happened after leaving.

But B did see me put the brick in the basket, and B has no information about any changes after leaving. So B should reasonably answer "brick" for the basket.

The risk is that C or D moved the brick after we left, and the question is what B will answer. B will answer based on what B knows — B saw the brick go in the basket and has no information about changes. So B should answer "brick."

Since B already knows what was in the basket (B was present when I put the brick there), there's no need to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

B answers: brick

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket now and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I, B, C, and D are all in the room. I put a stapler in the basket. Everyone sees this.
2. I leave the room. B, C, and D remain.
3. B leaves the room. C and D remain.
4. D leaves the room. C is alone in the room.
5. D enters the room. C and D are in the room.
6. B enters the room. B, C, and D are in the room.
7. B leaves the room. C and D are in the room.

The key question: what happened while C was alone in the room (between D leaving and D entering)? C could have moved or removed the stapler from the basket. Also, between steps 4-7, C was always in the room and could have manipulated containers at any point.

From B's perspective: B saw me put the stapler in the basket. Then B left (step 3). While B was outside, B knows D left, then D entered, then B entered. When B re-entered (step 6), B could see the room but NOT the contents of containers. B doesn't know if C moved anything while B was away. Then B left again (step 7).

So B's last knowledge is uncertain - B knows the stapler was in the basket initially, but C was alone in the room for a period and could have moved things. B doesn't know the current state of the basket.

From my perspective: I also don't know what happened after I left. C was in the room the entire time and could have moved the stapler.

I don't have reliable information about the current contents of the basket. However, the most likely scenario in these games is that C may or may not have moved things. But I should consider: should I tell B what I last knew?

B already knows I put the stapler in the basket (B was present for that). B's uncertainty is the same as mine - we don't know if C moved it. Since I have no additional information beyond what B already knows, telling B would cost 0.5 points without adding value.

I should Pass, since I can't provide B with any information they don't already have.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: The orange is in the bag, and I know this because I saw D put it there. D also saw himself put the orange in the bag, and nothing has changed in the bag since then. So D knows the answer.

Since D knows what's in the bag (he put the orange there himself), and nothing happened to the bag after that, D will correctly answer "orange." This means the Red team will get 1 point regardless of what I do.

There's no action I can take that would change D's answer or prevent the Red team from scoring. Any Ask or Tell action would cost my team 0.5 points without benefit.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: empty
- Box: stapler
- Basket: apple

**What D knows:**
D was in the room when the stapler was put in the box. Then B left, then D left. After D left, C moved things around. D was outside the room for all of C's moves, so D doesn't know about any of them.

D's belief: The box still contains the stapler (which is actually correct, since C moved it out and back).

**The question:** I will be asked what D says is in the box. Wait - the question is asking D what is in the box. D will answer based on their knowledge.

D thinks the stapler is still in the box (since D left before any changes). The actual contents of the box IS the stapler (C moved it out then back). So D will likely answer "stapler" which is correct.

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (earning Red 1 point), I should consider whether I can mislead D. I could Tell D false information about the box to trick them into giving a wrong answer.

If I Tell D that the box contains something else (like the apple), D might change their answer. But D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. However, there's a chance D might think I'm being helpful or that things changed after they left.

The risk: If D trusts my false information, Red loses 1 point and it costs me 0.5 points. Net effect: Red gets 0, Blue gets -0.5. If D doesn't trust me, Red gets 1 point and Blue gets -0.5 points. 

If I Pass: Red likely gets 1 point, Blue gets 0.

The expected value of telling a lie depends on whether D trusts me. Since I'm on the opposing team, D should be skeptical. The downside (-0.5 with D still getting it right) is worse than just passing (0 with D getting it right).

I'll pass since trying to mislead D is risky and costly.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room initially. C put an apple in the bag.
2. B leaves the room. (C is still in the room.)
3. C moves the apple from the bag to the box. (C knows the bag is now empty and the box has the apple.)
4. D puts an orange in the bag. (C is still in the room, so C sees this.)
5. C leaves the room. (At this point, C knows: bag has orange, box has apple.)

After C leaves, nothing else happens. So C knows the bag contains an orange.

Since I'm on the Blue team and C is on the Red team, C will be asked what's in the bag. C knows the correct answer (orange), so C will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for the Red team.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly since C directly observed the orange being placed in the bag. Any Tell action I send to C with false information would cost me 0.5 points, and C has no reason to believe me over their own observations.

The best action is to Pass, saving my team the 0.5 point cost since I can't influence C's correct knowledge.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through the scenario from C's perspective:

1. All players start in the room. C puts an apple in the bag.
2. B leaves the room. (C sees this)
3. C moves the apple from the bag to the box. (C knows: box=apple, bag=empty)
4. D puts an orange in the bag. (C sees this: bag=orange, box=apple)
5. C leaves the room. (At this point, C knows: bag=orange, box=apple, basket=empty)

After C leaves, C doesn't see:
- Me moving apple from box to basket
- D moving apple from basket to box
- Me moving apple from box to basket

So C's last knowledge of the bag is that it contains an **orange**.

The current actual state of the bag: D put an orange in the bag (step 4), and nobody moved the orange after that. So the bag still contains an **orange**.

C will be asked what's in the bag. C last saw D put an orange in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after C left. So C should correctly answer "orange."

This means the Red team will likely get 1 point from this question. 

Let me consider if I can do anything useful. I could try to Tell C wrong information to trick them, but C already knows what's in the bag from direct observation, so they'd likely trust their own memory over my tell. In fact, telling C something false might just waste 0.5 points for my team.

I could also try to prepare for future rounds by communicating with B, but I don't know what future questions will be yet.

The best action is to Pass, since any Tell to C would cost 0.5 points and C is unlikely to believe misinformation about something they directly observed.

Pass
C answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Let me trace through the scenario from C's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room. C puts an apple in the bag.
2. B leaves the room. (C sees this)
3. C moves the apple from the bag to the box. (C knows: box has apple, bag is empty)
4. D puts an orange in the bag. (C sees this: bag has orange, box has apple)
5. C leaves the room. (At this point, C knows: bag=orange, box=apple, basket=empty)

After C leaves, C doesn't see:
- Me moving apple from box to basket
- D moving apple from basket to box
- Me moving apple from box to basket

So C's last knowledge is: bag=orange, box=apple, basket=empty.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to C.

C will likely answer "orange" based on what C last saw, which is actually correct! The bag currently contains an orange (nothing happened to the orange after D put it in the bag).

So C will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point.

Now, should I use Tell to try to mislead C? I could tell C false information about the bag. But C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). C saw the orange go into the bag and never saw it removed, so C would likely stick with "orange."

Alternatively, I could try to trick C by telling them something that sounds plausible. For instance, I could tell C that the bag is empty (implying someone moved the orange). But C would likely be suspicious since I'm on the Blue team.

The cost of a Tell is 0.5 points, and the chance of successfully misleading C is low since C directly observed the orange being placed in the bag and left the room after that. C has strong confidence in their knowledge of the bag's contents.

The expected value of telling C false info: -0.5 (cost) + small probability of preventing Red from scoring 1 point. It's probably not worth it.

Pass
C answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

2. C puts a stapler in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room.
4. C moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (A, C, D see this)

6. C leaves the room.
7. D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. (A, D see this)
8. D moves the orange from the box to the bag. (A, D see this)
9. D moves the orange from the bag to the box. (A, D see this)

**Current state of containers:**
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty
- Basket: stapler

**What C knows:**
C left after step 5. At that point:
- Box: orange
- Bag: stapler
- Basket: empty

C doesn't know about steps 7-9 (the movements after C left). So C likely thinks the box still contains an orange.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to C.

The actual answer is **orange**. C's belief is also that the box contains an **orange** (since when C left, D had just put an orange in the box, and C is unaware of the subsequent moves).

So C will likely answer "orange" which is actually correct! This means the Red team would get 1 point.

I could try to Tell C wrong information to mislead them, but C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). In fact, telling C something might even reinforce their confidence or they'd just ignore me.

Since C is likely to answer correctly regardless of what I do, and any Tell/Ask action costs 0.5 points, the best action is to not spend points on something unlikely to help.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- C was in the room when they put an apple in the bag.
- C then left the room.
- After C left, B and I moved a banana around, but the bag was never touched after C left.
- The bag still contains the apple.

**What C knows:**
- C put an apple in the bag.
- C left the room and doesn't know what happened after that.
- C knows the bag had an apple when they left.

**The question:** C will be asked what's in the bag.

C is on the Red team. C knows they put an apple in the bag, but they don't know if anything changed after they left. However, since C is on the Red team and wants to answer correctly for their own team's benefit, C will likely answer "apple" — which is correct, since the bag was never touched after C put the apple in it.

Since C is being asked and C is on the Red team, a correct answer gives Red 1 point. I want to prevent that.

I could try to **Tell C false information** to trick them into giving a wrong answer. For example, I could tell C that the bag contains something other than an apple, hoping C believes me and answers incorrectly. But this costs 0.5 points.

However, C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). C saw with their own eyes that they put an apple in the bag. It's unlikely C would believe me if I told them the bag contains something else — they'd probably stick with what they know.

The cost of telling is 0.5 points to my team, and the chance of C believing me (an opponent) over their own direct observation is very low. This would likely just cost us 0.5 points for nothing.

The best action is to Pass.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and C are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a ball in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... B moves the ball from the box to the bag. ... You put an apple in the box. ... B moves the apple from the box to the basket. ... You move the ball from the bag to the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the box.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be best for my team.

Let me trace through what C saw:
- C was in the room initially and put a ball in the box.
- C then left the room.
- After C left, B moved the ball from the box to the bag, I put an apple in the box, B moved the apple to the basket, and I moved the ball to the box.

C doesn't know about any of the moves that happened after they left. So C believes the ball is still in the box (where they put it).

The current actual state:
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty
- Basket: apple

The question is: What is in the box? The answer is "ball."

C will be asked what's in the box. C believes the ball is in the box (since that's the last thing C saw before leaving). The actual contents of the box IS the ball. So C will likely answer "ball" which is correct!

This means the Red team would get 1 point if C answers correctly. I should consider whether I can mislead C.

If I use Tell(C, box, apple), C might believe me and say "apple" instead of "ball," which would be wrong. But C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. However, it's worth trying since it could prevent Red from scoring.

The cost is 0.5 points to my team, so if it works, the net effect is: Red gets 0 instead of 1, and Blue loses 0.5. That's better than Red getting +1.

If C doesn't trust me, Red gets +1 and Blue loses 0.5, which is worse than passing (where Red just gets +1).

C might reason: "Why would an opponent tell me the truth? They're trying to trick me." But C might also think: "Maybe A is trying to reverse-psychology me." It's uncertain.

The risk is that C was in the room when they placed the ball, so they have direct knowledge. They might just stick with what they know. Telling C could backfire by costing us 0.5 with no benefit.

I think the chance C changes their answer based on my tell is relatively low since they have direct firsthand knowledge. The 0.5 cost makes this risky.

I'll pass.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a ball in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the ball from the box to the bag. ... C puts a stapler in the box. ... B leaves the room. ...

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: ball
- Box: stapler
- Basket: empty

**What D saw before leaving:**
- B put a ball in the box
- Then D left the room

**What D missed (happened after D left):**
- B moved the ball from the box to the bag
- C put a stapler in the box
- B left the room

So D thinks the box still contains the ball. The correct answer is that the box contains a stapler.

Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer **incorrectly**. D currently believes the box has a ball, which is wrong. If I do nothing, D will likely say "ball" and get it wrong, which means Red gets no point.

However, C is on D's team and C was in the room the whole time. C knows the box contains a stapler. C could Tell D the correct answer during C's turn.

If I Pass now, C might use their turn to tell D the truth (costing Red 0.5 points but gaining 1 point for a net of +0.5). 

Could I mislead D? I could Tell D something false, but D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. I could also try to preemptively confuse things.

Actually, the key question is the turn order. It's my turn now. I don't know if C gets a turn before D has to answer. But if C does get a turn, C will likely tell D the correct answer.

Let me consider: If I tell D the box contains the ball, that reinforces D's wrong belief. But D already believes that, so it's redundant. If I tell D the box contains the stapler (the truth), that would help the Red team - bad for me.

I think the best play is to **Pass**. D already has the wrong belief (ball in the box). If C tells D the truth, it costs Red 0.5 points. If C doesn't, D answers wrong. Either way, passing costs me nothing.

Pass
D answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what D knows and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room initially and saw B put a ball in the box.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: B moved the ball from box to bag, C put a stapler in the box, B left, I moved the ball from bag to basket, C moved the ball from basket to bag, I moved the ball from bag to basket.

So D knows the ball was put in the box, but D left before anything else happened. D likely thinks the ball is still in the box.

The actual contents of the box: C put a stapler in the box, and nothing was moved out of the box after that. So the box contains the **stapler**.

D will be asked what's in the box. D will likely answer "ball" since that's the last thing D saw placed there. That would be wrong - the correct answer is "stapler."

D is on the Red team, so if D answers incorrectly, that's good for my Blue team. I should not help D.

But wait - could C (D's teammate) help D? C was in the room the whole time and knows the stapler is in the box. C might Tell D the correct answer. However, it's currently MY turn, not C's turn. The action phase is for me right now.

Since D is likely to answer incorrectly (saying "ball" instead of "stapler"), that benefits my team. I should just Pass and let D get it wrong.

Pass
D answers: ball

Action: I need to figure out what's optimal here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: ball (C moved it from basket to bag)
- Box: stapler (C put it there)
- Basket: empty

**What D knows:**
D was present when B put the ball in the box. Then D left the room. D doesn't know about anything that happened after they left. So D thinks:
- Box: ball (D's last knowledge before leaving)
- Bag: empty
- Basket: empty

**The question is: What is in the box?**
The correct answer is: **stapler**

D thinks the box contains the **ball** (since D left before B moved the ball and before C put the stapler in the box). So D will likely answer "ball," which is **wrong**.

This is great for my team (Blue) since D is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly. I should **not** help D get the right answer.

However, I should consider whether C might use their turn to Tell D the correct answer. C was in the room the whole time and knows the box contains a stapler. C could tell D before the answer phase.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from telling D the truth. But I could try to confuse D by telling D something false - though D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Let me think about whether spending 0.5 points to Tell D false information is worth it. If C tells D the truth (costing Red 0.5 points), D answers correctly and Red gets 1 point (net +0.5 for Red). If I also tell D something false (costing Blue 0.5 points), D gets conflicting information and might not know who to trust - but D would likely trust their teammate C over me.

The best play is to Pass. D will likely answer "ball" (wrong) without any intervention, and if C spends 0.5 to correct D, Red only nets 0.5. No need to spend points.

Pass
D answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what D knows and what the right answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. Bag, box, basket are empty.
2. B puts a brick in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room. (D's last knowledge: brick is in the bag)
4. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (D doesn't see this)
5. B moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (D doesn't see this)
6. B moves the brick from the bag to the box. (D doesn't see this)
7. C puts a stapler in the bag. (D doesn't see this)
8. B leaves the room. (D knows B left but doesn't see container changes)

**Current actual state:** The bag contains a stapler, the box contains a brick, the basket is empty.

**D's knowledge:** D left after step 2. D last saw the brick placed in the bag. D doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So D likely believes the brick is still in the bag.

The question is asking D what is in the bag. The correct answer is **stapler**. D probably thinks it's the **brick**.

Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer incorrectly. If D answers "brick" (which is wrong), that's good for my team - Red doesn't get a point.

However, D might not know the actual contents. If I tell D the truth, D would answer correctly and Red gets a point. If I stay silent, D will likely say "brick" which is wrong.

The best action is to **Pass** - don't give D any information. Let D answer based on their outdated knowledge (brick), which is incorrect.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what action would be most beneficial.

**What I know:**
- I put a ball in the box (everyone saw this since all were in the room)
- B left the room (everyone knows this)
- C left the room (everyone knows this)
- After C left: D moved the ball from the box to the bag, and D put a brick in the box
- So currently: bag has the ball, box has the brick, basket is empty

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put a ball in the box
- C saw B leave the room
- C then left the room
- C does NOT know about D's actions (moving ball to bag, putting brick in box)
- So C believes: box has the ball, bag is empty, basket is empty

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the box.
- C will likely answer "ball" (based on what C last saw)
- The correct answer is "brick"
- C is on the Red team, so if C answers correctly, Red gets a point

**My options:**
- If I **Tell C the truth** (Tell(C, box, brick)), C would know the correct answer and Red would score 1 point, but it costs Blue 0.5 points. That's bad for us (-0.5 for Blue, +1 for Red).
- If I **Tell C a lie** (e.g., Tell(C, box, ball)), C might trust it or not, but C already thinks it's a ball, so this doesn't change anything. Costs us 0.5 points for nothing.
- If I **Pass**, C will likely answer "ball" (incorrect), Red gets 0 points, and Blue loses nothing.

The best action is to Pass. C will likely give the wrong answer ("ball"), which is good for our team.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. Everyone starts in the room. The bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. I put a ball in the box. (C sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (C sees this)
4. C leaves the room. (C is now outside)
5. After C leaves: D moves ball from box to bag, D puts brick in box, I move ball from bag to basket, D moves ball from basket to bag, I move ball from bag to basket.

C didn't see anything after leaving. So C's last knowledge is:
- Ball is in the box
- Bag is empty
- Basket is empty

The question is: What is in the box?

Currently, the box contains a **brick** (D put it there after moving the ball out).

C will likely answer based on what they last saw, which is that the **ball** is in the box. That would be **wrong** - good for us!

Now, should I Tell C something, Ask someone something, or Pass?

If I Pass (0 cost): C will likely answer "ball" which is wrong. Red gets 0 points. Blue gets 0 points. Net: 0 for us.

If I Tell C the truth (that the box has a brick) - cost 0.5 points: C would get it right, Red gets 1 point. Net: Red gains 1, we lose 0.5. Bad for us.

If I Tell C a lie (e.g., the box has something else wrong) - cost 0.5: C might believe me or not. If C believes my lie, they'd answer wrong (same as passing but we lose 0.5). If C doesn't believe me, they might reconsider and possibly guess correctly. Risky.

The best action is to **Pass**. C doesn't know the box contents changed, and will likely answer "ball" which is incorrect. This costs us nothing and Red scores nothing.

C answers: ball

Action: I need to think about what each player knows.

**What I know:**
- I put an orange in the box initially.
- B left the room, then C left the room.
- After both left, D moved the orange around and eventually put it in the bag, then put a brick in the box.
- So the box currently contains a **brick**.

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put an orange in the box (C was in the room at that time).
- C left the room after B left.
- C did NOT see D's movements (D moved things after C left).
- So C believes the box still contains an **orange**.

**The question is for C: What is in the box?**
- The correct answer is **brick**.
- C thinks it's an **orange**, so C will likely answer "orange" which is **wrong**.
- This is good for my team (Blue) since C is on the Red team.

**Should I act?**
- If I Tell C the truth (brick is in the box), C might answer correctly, giving Red a point. That would be bad for me.
- If I Tell C a lie, it costs 0.5 points and C might not trust me anyway.
- If I Pass, C will likely answer "orange" (which is wrong), and Red gets 0 points while I spend nothing.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when C put a brick in the box.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, B moved the brick from the box to the bag, and I put a stapler in the box.
- D doesn't know about these changes.

So D believes the box still contains the **brick**.

**The actual contents of the box:** a **stapler**.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the box. D thinks it's a brick, but the correct answer is a stapler.

If D answers "brick," that's wrong, and Red gets 0 points. That's good for us!

However, D might take an action before the answer phase (or other players might). But right now it's MY turn.

Should I Tell D the correct contents? No - that would help the Red team and cost us 0.5 points.

Should I Tell D wrong information? That costs 0.5 points but D already has wrong information, so it's unnecessary.

Should I Pass? D already has the wrong information about the box, so D will likely answer incorrectly. Passing costs nothing and keeps the situation favorable for us.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a brick in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the brick from the box to the bag. ... You put a stapler in the box. ... B moves the brick from the bag to the basket. ... You move the brick from the basket to the bag. ... B moves the brick from the bag to the basket. ...

I am going to ask D what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room. (C no longer sees what happens)
4. D leaves the room. (D no longer sees what happens)
5. B moves the brick from the box to the bag. (Only A and B see this)
6. I put a stapler in the box. (Only A and B see this)
7. B moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (Only A and B see this)
8. I move the brick from the basket to the bag. (Only A and B see this)
9. B moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (Only A and B see this)

Current state of containers:
- Box: stapler
- Basket: brick
- Bag: empty

D's knowledge: D saw C put a brick in the box, then C left, then D left. D doesn't know about any changes after that. So D would believe the box still contains the brick.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to D.
The correct answer is: **stapler**.

D will likely answer "brick" based on their last knowledge, which is wrong. This is good for my team (Blue) since D is on the Red team - they'll get it wrong and score 0 points.

I should Pass here. There's no reason to help D (a Red team player) get the right answer, and telling D the truth would cost us 0.5 points AND help the opposing team score. Passing costs nothing and D will likely answer incorrectly.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when C put a brick in the box.
- Then C left the room (D saw this).
- Then D left the room.
- After D left, B moved the brick from box to bag, I put a stapler in the box, I moved the brick from bag to basket, and B moved the brick from basket to bag.
- D doesn't know about any of these moves after leaving.

So D thinks the brick is still in the box. The actual contents of the box is the **stapler**.

D will likely answer "brick" (which is wrong), so Red gets 0 points from this question.

Since D will answer incorrectly on their own, I don't need to help them (they're on the opposing team anyway!). And I don't need to spend points telling my teammate anything since B was in the room for all the relevant events.

The best action is to Pass - D will answer incorrectly, and I don't need to spend any points.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when C put an apple in the bag.
- D saw C leave the room.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, D is unaware of what happened inside the room (the apple being moved around, the stapler being put in the bag).
- So D believes the apple is still in the bag.

**Current actual state:**
- Bag: stapler
- Box: apple
- Basket: empty

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.
- D thinks the bag contains the apple.
- The correct answer is the stapler.

D is on the Red team. If D answers "apple" (which is what D believes), that's wrong, and Red gets 0 points. That's good for us.

Now, should I take an action? 

- If I **Pass**, D will likely answer "apple" (wrong). Blue gets 0 points this round, Red gets 0 points. Net: neutral.
- If I **Tell D** the truth (stapler in the bag), it costs us 0.5 points, and D would answer correctly, giving Red 1 point. Net: -1.5 for us. Terrible.
- If I **Tell D** a lie, it costs 0.5 points and might confuse D, but D already has the wrong answer. No benefit.
- If I **Ask** anyone anything, it costs 0.5 points with no clear benefit this round.

The best action is to **Pass** — D will likely give the wrong answer, costing Red nothing but also gaining them nothing. We lose nothing.

Pass
D answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a banana in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the banana from the basket to the bag. ... C enters the room. ... D moves the banana from the bag to the basket. ... You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask C what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: Let me think through this carefully.

**What I know:**
1. C put a banana in the basket initially.
2. C left the room.
3. While C was out, D moved the banana from basket to bag.
4. C re-entered the room.
5. After C re-entered, D moved the banana from bag to basket (C saw this).
6. Then I (A) left, then B left.

So at the point I left, the banana was in the basket, and C was in the room and saw D move it back to the basket.

**What C knows:** C saw the banana placed in the basket originally. C left and missed the move to the bag. When C came back, C saw D move the banana from the bag to the basket. So C knows the banana is in the basket at that point.

**But** after both A and B left the room, C and D are still in the room. Something could have happened after we left that we don't know about. However, the scenario description ends there - no further actions are described from my perspective (I would know if someone entered or left the room, but no movements are described).

Since I left the room, I wouldn't be told about any object movements that happened after. But the scenario as described to me doesn't mention any further entries/exits after B leaves.

**Key question:** The question is asking C what's in the basket. C was in the room the whole time after re-entering, so C knows the current state. C knows the banana is in the basket (assuming nothing happened after A and B left, which we can't see but the scenario doesn't hint at further changes).

Since C is on the Red team, C will answer correctly if the banana is still in the basket - earning Red a point. 

I can't influence C's answer since C is an opponent. I could try to Tell C false information to confuse them, but C was in the room and saw everything - C would know the truth and likely ignore my misinformation.

There's nothing beneficial I can do here. Any Ask or Tell would cost 0.5 points with no benefit.

Action: I need to think about this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room when B put an apple in the bag.
- I was in the room when B put a stapler in the basket.
- Then I left the room.
- After I left, things may or may not have changed (I wouldn't know).

**What C knows:**
- C was in the room the entire time (never mentioned leaving).
- C saw B put an apple in the bag and a stapler in the basket.
- C was still in the room after I left, so C would know about any changes that happened after I left.

**The question:** I will be asked what C will say about the bag's contents.

Wait - the question is directed at C, not at me. C is on the Red team. C knows what's in the bag (since C has been in the room the whole time). When asked, C will answer, and if C answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point.

Since C was in the room the entire time, C knows exactly what's in the bag. C will want to answer correctly to earn a point for the Red team.

**My action options:**
- I could Tell C false information, but C was in the room the whole time and knows the truth, so lying to C won't help.
- I could Ask someone about the bag, but that costs 0.5 points. C knows the truth and might lie to me. B might or might not know (B was in the room when I left - B wasn't described as leaving either, so B likely knows too).
- I could Pass and save the 0.5 points.

Since C is on the Red team and knows the contents of the bag (C never left the room), C will almost certainly answer correctly and score 1 point for Red. There's nothing I can do to prevent that - any Tell to C would be ignored since C knows the truth, and spending 0.5 points on an Ask would just cost us points without changing the outcome.

Pass
C answers: brick

**What I know:**
- I was in the room when B put an apple in the bag.
- I was in the room when D put a ball in the basket.
- I then left the room, so I don't know if anything changed after I left.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag.

**What C knows:** C was in the room the entire time (as far as I know). C saw B put an apple in the bag, and D put a ball in the basket. C also saw anything that happened after I left the room.

**Strategy considerations:**
- C is on the Red team. C will want to answer correctly to score a point for Red.
- C was present for everything, so C likely knows what's in the bag.
- If nothing changed after I left, the bag still contains the apple, and C knows this.

Since C is on the opposing team and was in the room the whole time, C likely knows the correct answer. There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly - I can't communicate with C in a way that would help my team (telling C wrong information would cost me 0.5 points, and C has no reason to believe me over their own observations).

The best action is to **Pass** - spending 0.5 points to Tell C misleading information won't work because C saw everything firsthand and would just ignore my misinformation. Any action I take costs points without benefit.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what C knows about the box and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through what C has seen:

1. **Everyone in room**: B puts stapler in box. C sees this.
2. **C leaves the room**: C misses what happens next.
3. **D moves stapler from box to basket**: C doesn't see this (outside room).
4. **C enters the room**: C is back but doesn't know about the move.
5. **I move stapler from basket to box**: C sees this happen. C sees me move the stapler from the basket to the box.
6. **I leave the room**: Nothing else happens after this.

So C saw me move the stapler from the basket to the box. C knows the stapler is in the box.

Wait - but after I leave, does anything else happen? The scenario ends with "..." after I leave, but nothing else is described. Since I'm outside the room, I wouldn't see if something happened, but the scenario doesn't mention anyone else doing anything.

However, I need to consider: after I left, could D have moved something? The scenario as described to me only shows "You leave the room. ..." - since I'm outside, I wouldn't know if D did anything. But the scenario doesn't describe any further actions, so I should assume nothing else happened (or at least, I don't know about it).

The current state (as far as I know): stapler is in the box. C witnessed me put the stapler in the box, so C should know the box contains the stapler.

C is on the Red team, so C will answer correctly (stapler in the box) and Red gets a point. There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly since C directly saw me put the stapler in the box.

I could try to Tell C false information, but C saw the action directly, so C would likely not believe me. Still, spending 0.5 points to try to deceive C when C has direct knowledge seems wasteful.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Action: Looking at this scenario, let me trace through what happened:

1. I put a banana in the bag.
2. I leave the room. (Things may happen while I'm gone that I don't see)
3. I enter the room. (I can now see what happens again)
4. D moves the banana from the **basket** to the bag. — This tells me that while I was outside, someone moved the banana from the bag to the basket. Now D moves it back to the bag.
5. C leaves the room.
6. B moves the banana from the bag to the box.
7. D puts a brick in the bag.

So at the end of the scenario:
- **Bag**: brick
- **Box**: banana
- **Basket**: empty

I'm being asked what is in the bag. I know the answer: **brick**.

No need to spend points on asking or telling anyone.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. The bag, box, and basket are all empty.
2. B puts an apple in the bag. → Bag has apple.
3. "..." - time passes. I'm still in the room.
4. I leave the room. → I can no longer see what happens inside.
5. "..." - time passes. I'm outside the room. Things could have happened that I don't know about.
6. I enter the room. → I can now see what happens again.
7. D moves the apple from the **box** to the bag. → This means that while I was outside, someone moved the apple from the bag to the box. Now D moves it back from the box to the bag.

So after D's action, the apple is in the bag.

But wait - I need to consider whether anything else happened while I was outside or after D's move. The scenario describes D moving the apple from the box to the bag as the last action. So the bag currently contains the apple.

However, I should also consider: could other objects have been placed in containers while I was outside? I only know about the apple. While I was outside, someone moved the apple from the bag to the box (since D later moves it from the box). Other things could have happened too, but I wasn't told about objects being placed while I was outside (which is consistent with the rules - I wouldn't see those).

The question is about what's in the bag. After D moves the apple from the box to the bag, the apple is in the bag. But could something else have been in the bag when D put the apple there? Containers can hold at most one object, so if something was in the bag, D couldn't have put the apple there. Since D successfully moved the apple to the bag, the bag must have been empty at that point (the apple had been moved to the box while I was away, and apparently nothing else was put in the bag, or if something was, it was removed before D's action).

So the bag contains the apple. I'm confident in this answer.

Pass
A answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

1. Everyone starts in the room. Bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. D leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. I put an **orange** in the bag.
5. B enters the room.
6. D enters the room.
7. I leave the room.

Now I'm outside the room. I can't see what happens inside, but I know who enters/leaves.

8. B leaves the room.
9. C leaves the room.
10. I enter the room.

Now I'm back in the room and can see what happens:

11. D moves the **apple** from the bag to the basket.

Wait - I put an orange in the bag, but now D is moving an "apple" from the bag. This means someone must have swapped the orange for an apple while I was outside (between steps 7-10). But let me re-read... The scenario says "D moves the apple from the bag to the basket." This is what I observe, so while I was outside, someone must have replaced the orange with an apple (or the scenario is describing what actually happens).

Actually, the scenario describes what I see. So when I re-enter at step 10, D moves an apple from the bag to the basket. This means while I was out (steps 7-9), someone (C or D, who were in the room) must have swapped the orange for an apple.

12. D moves the apple from the basket to the bag. (So the apple is back in the bag.)
13. D leaves the room.
14. D enters the room.
15. I leave the room.

Now I'm outside again. I don't know what happens inside.

16. B enters the room.
17. B leaves the room.

So after step 14, D is in the room, and between steps 15-17, D (and briefly B) could have done things I can't see.

The last thing I **know** for certain is that the apple was in the bag (step 12). After I left at step 15, D was in the room and could have moved things. Then B entered and left.

I'm being asked what's in the bag. Based on my last observation, it was the apple. But things could have changed after I left.

D is on the Red team, so asking D is risky (they might lie). B is my teammate and was in the room briefly (steps 16-17). B could tell me if anything changed.

Let me ask B what's in the bag.

Ask(B, bag)
A answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket based on what I observed.

Let me trace through the events I witnessed:

1. Everyone starts in the room. D leaves.
2. C puts a brick in the basket. (I see this)
3. I leave the room. (Now I can't see what happens inside)
4. I enter the room. (I can see again)
5. C moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (I see this)
6. B moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (I see this)
7. B leaves the room.
8. B enters the room.
9. I leave the room. (Now I can't see what happens inside)
10. C leaves the room.

The key question is: did anything happen between step 9 (me leaving) and step 10 (C leaving)? 

From my perspective outside the room, I only know that C left the room after I did. Between me leaving and C leaving, C was alone in the room and could have moved things around. I wouldn't know about any container changes that happened while I was outside.

When I left (step 9), the brick was in the basket (B had moved it there in step 6). But C was still in the room alone and could have moved it.

However, the scenario only describes what I can see/know. Since I was outside, if C moved something, it wouldn't be described to me. The scenario as presented doesn't show any moves after I left - but that's because I couldn't observe them.

So I'm uncertain about the basket's contents. B was in the room when I left (B entered in step 8), and B also left... wait, let me re-read. B leaves, B enters, then I leave, then C leaves. So when I left, both B and C were in the room. Then C leaves. B might still be in the room.

B would know if anything changed after I left. Let me ask B.

Ask(B, basket)

Correct! The basket contains brick.

The answer to the question is straightforward. When I left the room, I knew the contents of all containers based on what I observed:

- **Box**: stapler (C put it there, and nobody moved it)
- **Bag**: apple (I moved it there last)
- **Basket**: empty

Since I'm being asked about the box, and I already know it contains the **stapler**, there's no need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box right now.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I, B, and C are in the room. C puts a brick in the box.
2. I leave the room. (I can't see what happens while I'm out, but I know if anyone enters/leaves.)
3. I enter the room. (No one left or entered while I was out, so B and C were still there.)
4. C moves the brick from the box to the bag. (I see this.)
5. B moves the brick from the bag to the box. (I see this.)
6. I leave the room. (After this, I can't see what happens.)

After step 5, the brick is in the box. After I leave in step 6, B and C are still in the room. I don't know if anything happened after I left.

Since I'm being asked what's in the box, and I'm not sure if B or C moved anything after I left, I should consider whether to ask someone.

B is my teammate and would have incentive to tell me the truth. C is on the opposing team and might lie. Let me ask B what's in the box.

Actually, wait - the question is being asked to ME. I need to decide if I should spend 0.5 points to Ask B, or just answer based on what I know.

If I answer correctly, I get 1 point. If I ask B first, it costs 0.5, so net gain would be 0.5 if correct. If I just guess based on my last knowledge (brick in the box) and I'm right, I get 1 point.

The risk is that something changed after I left. B and C were both in the room and could have moved things. But B is my teammate - B would want me to answer correctly. If B moved the brick, B would want to help me know.

However, B doesn't know what question I'll be asked yet. Let me ask B to be safe.

Ask(B, box)

Action: The question will be asked to B about what is in the bag.

Let me think about what B knows:
- B was in the room when they put a banana in the bag.
- B then left the room.
- After B left, nothing happened to the bag - I put a ball in the box, and C and I moved the ball around between the box and basket.

So the bag still contains the banana, and B knows this because B put the banana in the bag and nothing happened to the bag after that (though B wouldn't know what happened after leaving, the bag was indeed untouched).

B should correctly answer "banana" for the bag. No need to spend points on communication.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and whether B knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. All containers are empty.
2. B puts a stapler in the box. → Box: stapler
3. B leaves the room. → B last saw: box has stapler
4. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. → Box: empty, Bag: stapler
5. C puts an apple in the box. → Box: apple
6. D moves the apple from the box to the basket. → Box: empty, Basket: apple
7. C moves the stapler from the bag to the box. → Box: stapler, Bag: empty
8. D leaves the room.

So currently the box contains the **stapler**.

B left the room after step 2, so B's last knowledge is that the box contains the stapler (which B put there). B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves.

However, B will be asked what's in the box. B's last knowledge is that the box has a stapler, and the box currently **does** have a stapler (after C moved it back). So B would naturally answer "stapler" which is correct!

Since B will likely answer correctly without any help, I should Pass to avoid spending 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this)

4. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (A, B, D see this)

6. B leaves the room.

So B was present for all the moves. B saw:
- Stapler put in basket
- Stapler moved from basket to bag
- Apple put in basket

B knows the basket contains an apple. Since B has the correct information, B should answer "apple" which is correct.

Wait - but after B left the room, did anything else happen? Let me re-read... After B leaves, there's nothing else that happens before the question. So B's knowledge is accurate.

B knows the basket contains an apple, and that IS what's in the basket. B should answer correctly without any help from me.

I'll save the 0.5 points and pass.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. ... D puts an apple in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the box. ... D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:
1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D).
2. D puts a stapler in the basket.
3. C leaves the room.
4. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.
5. D puts an apple in the basket.
6. B leaves the room.
7. I move the stapler from the bag to the box.
8. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag.
9. I move the stapler from the bag to the box.

So currently:
- **Basket**: apple
- **Box**: stapler
- **Bag**: empty

B left the room after step 5. At that point, B saw:
- Basket: apple
- Bag: stapler
- Box: empty

B doesn't know about steps 7-9 (the stapler moving around between bag and box). But B does know the basket contains an apple, since the apple was placed in the basket (step 5) before B left (step 6), and nothing has changed in the basket since.

So B already knows the basket contains an apple. The correct answer is "apple." B should be able to answer this correctly without any help from me.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room. D puts a ball in the basket.
2. C leaves the room.
3. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag.
4. D puts an apple in the basket.
5. B leaves the room. (At this point, B knows: ball is in the bag, apple is in the basket)
6. D moves the ball from the bag to the box.
7. D moves the apple from the basket to the bag.
8. D moves the apple from the bag to the basket.

So the current state is:
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty
- Basket: apple

B left after step 4, so B thinks:
- Bag: ball
- Basket: apple
- Box: empty

B will be asked what's in the basket. B thinks the basket contains the apple, which is actually correct (the apple ended up back in the basket after being moved around).

So B's belief about the basket is **apple**, and the actual content is **apple**. B will answer correctly without any help from me.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what B will be asked.

B will be asked what is in the bag.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room when I put a ball in the bag. So B knows the bag contains a ball.
2. B then left the room and didn't see anything else.

After B left:
- C put a stapler in the basket
- I moved the stapler from the basket to the box
- D moved the stapler from the box to the basket

None of these actions affected the bag. The bag still contains the ball.

B knows the bag contains a ball (B saw me put it there), and the bag still contains a ball. So B will correctly answer "ball" without any help from me.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. I put a banana in the box.
3. B leaves the room.
4. After B leaves: D moves banana from box to bag.
5. C puts a stapler in the box.
6. D moves stapler from box to basket.
7. C moves banana from bag to box.

So the current state is:
- Box: banana
- Bag: empty
- Basket: stapler

B saw me put the banana in the box, then left. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. So B thinks the box still contains the banana.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B.

B's best guess based on their own knowledge would be "banana" - which happens to be correct! The banana was moved around but ended up back in the box.

So if I Pass, B will likely answer "banana" (based on what B last saw), which is actually correct. That gives us 1 point for free.

If I Tell B the correct answer, it costs 0.5 points, and B gets it right for 1 point, netting 0.5 points.

If I Pass, B answers "banana" based on their own knowledge, which is correct, netting 1 point.

Passing is the best option since B's natural answer will be correct.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me analyze the situation:

**What I know (as player A, who was in the room the entire time):**
- C put a stapler in the box
- B left the room
- After B left: C moved the stapler from the box to the bag
- After B left: C put a brick in the box
- C left the room

**What B knows:**
- B saw C put a stapler in the box
- B then left the room
- B doesn't know about the stapler being moved to the bag or the brick being put in the box
- So B thinks the box still contains the stapler

**The actual contents of the box:** a brick

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the box.

B will likely answer "stapler" based on their last knowledge, which is **wrong**. The correct answer is "brick."

I should tell B what's actually in the box so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The Tell action costs 0.5 points, but a correct answer gives 1 point, so the net gain is +0.5 points.

Tell(B, box, brick)

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the bag, then D left, then B left.
- After B left, C moved the apple from the bag to the box, and put a stapler in the bag.
- B doesn't know about C's actions since B was outside the room when they happened.
- B thinks the apple is still in the bag.

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the bag.
- B will likely answer "apple" (since that's what B last knew), but the correct answer is "stapler."
- If B answers "apple," that's wrong, and Red gets nothing but Blue also gets nothing.
- Wait - B answering incorrectly means Blue doesn't get a point. That's fine for Red.

**Should I tell B?** If I Tell B the bag contains a stapler, it costs 0.5 points but B can answer correctly for 1 point, netting +0.5. If I Pass, B will likely say "apple" and get 0 points.

But wait - C and D are on the Red team. C knows what's in the bag (stapler). C might want B to answer incorrectly. C has no incentive to help B.

The strategic calculation:
- Tell B → costs 0.5, B answers correctly → +1, net = +0.5 for Blue
- Pass → B answers "apple" (wrong) → 0 points for Blue

+0.5 is better than 0, so I should tell B.

Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: stapler
- Box: empty
- Basket: apple

**What B knows:**
- B was in the room when they put the apple in the bag
- B left the room after D left
- B doesn't know about anything that happened after they left (C moving the apple, C putting the stapler in the bag, etc.)
- So B thinks the bag still contains the apple

**What I need to do:**
The question will be asked to B: "What is in the bag?" The correct answer is "stapler." B thinks the bag contains an apple, so B will answer "apple" which is wrong. That means Blue team gets 0 points for this question.

I should Tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5 points.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. B puts an apple in the bag.
2. D leaves the room. (D knows apple is in bag at this point)
3. B leaves the room. (B knows apple is in bag at this point)
4. C moves apple from bag to box. (Only A and C see this)
5. C puts a stapler in the bag. (Only A and C see this)
6. I (A) move apple from box to basket. (Only A and C see this)
7. C moves apple from basket to box. (Only A and C see this)

Current state:
- Bag: stapler
- Box: apple
- Basket: empty

B's knowledge: B last saw the apple put in the bag, then left. B doesn't know about any changes. So B will think the bag still contains the apple.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B.

B will likely answer "apple" (which is wrong - the bag actually contains a stapler).

Since B is my teammate, I should help B answer correctly. I should tell B what's in the bag.

Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone is in the room. B puts a banana in the box.
2. D leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. C moves the banana from box → basket → box → bag.
5. C puts a stapler in the box.

**Current state:** Box contains a stapler, bag contains a banana, basket is empty.

**What B knows:** B saw the banana go into the box. Then D left, then B left. B doesn't know what happened after leaving. B would assume the banana is still in the box (unless told otherwise).

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the box. Wait, no - "I am going to ask B what is in the box." So B will be asked.

B last saw a banana placed in the box, then left. B doesn't know C moved things around. B would answer "banana" - but the actual contents of the box is a **stapler**.

So B will answer incorrectly (saying "banana") unless I tell B what's actually in the box. If B answers correctly, Blue team gets 1 point.

If I Tell B the correct contents, it costs 0.5 points but B can answer correctly for 1 point, netting +0.5 points.

If I Pass, B will likely say "banana" which is wrong, netting 0 points.

So I should tell B the truth about the box.

Tell(B, box, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

2. After B left, D moved the banana from the bag to the box.
3. Then C put a brick in the bag.

Action: I need to figure out the current state of the containers and what B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. B puts a banana in the bag. → Bag: banana
2. B leaves the room. → B last saw: bag=banana, box=empty, basket=empty
3. D moves banana from bag to box. → Bag: empty, Box: banana
4. C puts a brick in the bag. → Bag: brick, Box: banana
5. D moves banana from box to basket. → Bag: brick, Box: empty, Basket: banana
6. C moves banana from basket to box. → Bag: brick, Box: banana, Basket: empty
7. D moves banana from box to basket. → Bag: brick, Box: empty, Basket: banana

Current state:
- Bag: brick
- Box: empty
- Basket: banana

B left after putting the banana in the bag and hasn't been in the room since. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. B would think the bag still contains the banana.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B.

The correct answer is **brick**. B doesn't know this - B would likely answer "banana" (which is wrong).

I should tell B what's in the bag so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the bag.

Let me trace through B's perspective:
1. B is in the room initially. B sees me put a brick in the bag.
2. B leaves the room.
3. While B is outside: D moves the brick from the bag to the box. B doesn't see this.
4. B enters the room.
5. B sees D put an orange in the bag.
6. D leaves the room.

So from B's perspective:
- B saw me put a brick in the bag initially.
- B was gone when D moved the brick out of the bag to the box.
- B returned and saw D put an orange in the bag.

Now, B might think the bag contains both a brick and an orange, but since each container holds at most one object, B would know only one object can be in the bag. Actually wait - B saw me put a brick in the bag, then B left, then B came back and saw D put an orange in the bag. B might think the brick is still in the bag (since B didn't see it removed), but the orange was also put in. Since containers hold at most one object, B might be confused or might reason that the orange replaced the brick, or that the brick must have been removed while B was away.

Actually, the key question is: what is currently in the bag? The answer is the **orange** (D put it there after moving the brick to the box).

B saw D put an orange in the bag. If B reasons that containers can only hold one object, B might conclude the bag has the orange. But B might also think the bag has the brick (from earlier) and be confused about the orange.

The safest action is to tell B what's in the bag so B answers correctly.

Tell(B, bag, orange)
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

1. B puts a ball in the box (B knows: box has ball)
2. B leaves the room
3. D moves ball from box to basket (B doesn't see this)
4. B enters the room (B doesn't know what changed while away)
5. C moves ball from basket to box (B sees this - B now knows box has ball)

Action: I need to decide whether to help B answer correctly about what's in the box.

Let me think about this:
- I, B, and D were all in the room when D put an orange in the box.
- Since B was in the room when this happened, B saw D put the orange in the box.
- B already knows the answer.

Since B already knows the contents of the box (an orange), there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

B was in the room the entire time. B saw D put an orange in the box. Nobody moved anything out of the box after that. So B knows the box contains an orange.

Since B was present for all events and knows the contents of the box, there's no need for me to spend points telling B something they already know.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a banana in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the banana from the box to the bag. ... B enters the room. ... D puts a ball in the box. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what B knows and whether B needs help.

Let me trace through what B saw:

1. B was in the room when D put a banana in the box.
2. B left the room.
3. While B was outside: D moved the banana from the box to the bag. (B doesn't know this)
4. B entered the room.
5. B saw D put a ball in the box.

So when B re-entered the room, B didn't know the banana had been moved from the box to the bag. Then B saw D put a ball in the box.

Now, what does B think is in the box? B saw a banana go in the box initially, then missed the banana being moved out, then saw a ball put in the box. 

The key question: does B think the box had a banana in it when the ball was put in? Since each container can hold at most one object, if B thinks the banana was still in the box, B might be confused about what happened when the ball was put in. But the scenario says D "puts a ball in the box" - B witnessed this directly. Since containers can hold at most one object, putting the ball in the box would mean the ball replaced whatever was there (or the box was empty).

Actually, B directly witnessed "D puts a ball in the box." So B knows the box currently contains a ball. Even if B thought the banana was still there, B saw the ball go in, and since a container holds at most one object, B would conclude the box now has a ball.

So B should correctly answer "ball" for the box. I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I was in the room when D put an orange in the basket. So I know the basket contains an orange.

**What B knows:** B left the room before D put the orange in the basket. B re-entered the room later, but by that time the orange was already in the basket (hidden from view since players can't see inside containers). So B does NOT know what's in the basket.

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the basket. B doesn't know the answer, but I do.

I should tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. This Tell action costs 0.5 points, but a correct answer gives 1 point, netting us +0.5 points.

B answers: orange

1. B starts in the room with everyone.
2. B leaves the room.

Since B was present when the banana was placed in the box, B knows the answer. Nothing happened to the box after that (at least while we were both still in the room). After we both left, something could have happened, but we wouldn't know about it. However, based on what B observed, B should answer "banana."

Since nothing happened to the box after C put the banana in it (at least while we were both still in the room), and B left after me (so B would have seen anything that happened before B left), B should know the box contains a banana.

However, after B left the room, C and D might still be in the room and could have moved things around. But the question is what B will answer - B would answer based on what B knows, which is that the banana was in the box when B left.

Wait, let me reconsider. After I left, something could have happened before B left. B would know about that. After B left, C and D could have changed things, but B wouldn't know. B's last knowledge is that the box has a banana.

B knows the answer. No need to spend points.

2. C puts an apple in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
3. I (A) leave the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. D leaves the room.
6. D enters the room.
7. B enters the room.
8. B leaves the room.

After C put the apple in the bag, I left the room. Then B left. Then D left. At this point, only C is in the room. C could have moved things around while alone. Then D entered - C and D (both Red team) were in the room together and could have rearranged things. Then B entered - B, C, and D were all in the room, and B would have seen anything that happened. Then B left.

The key question is: what happened while I was outside? I don't know what C (and later D) did with the objects. But B re-entered the room, so B would have seen any actions taken while B was present. However, things could have been moved while B was outside (between when B left and when D entered, C was alone; and between when D entered and B entered, C and D were together).

Since B entered the room again, B would have seen any actions that occurred while B was in the room (with C and D). But B wouldn't know about changes made before B re-entered.

The problem is: B might not know what's currently in the bag. Things could have been moved while B was outside, and containers aren't transparent. When B re-entered, B wouldn't automatically know the contents of containers - B would only know if something was moved while B was watching.

So B's knowledge: B saw the apple go into the bag initially. Then B was outside while C (alone) and then C+D could have moved things. B re-entered and saw whatever happened while present, then left again. If nothing was moved while B was in the room the second time, B wouldn't know if the apple is still in the bag.

I also don't know what's in the bag since I left before any potential changes.

However, the most likely scenario in the game is that C and D (Red team) may have moved the apple to trick B. But I can't be sure.

Since I don't know what's in the bag either, and B might have partial information from their second visit, I should ask B what they think is in the bag. But this costs 0.5 points.

Alternatively, I could tell B that the apple is in the bag (what we last knew), but if C moved it, that could be wrong.

The safest play: B saw the apple placed in the bag. If nothing was moved while B was in the room the second time, B might guess "apple" which could be right or wrong. Let me just Pass and hope B answers "apple" - if C didn't move it, we get 1 point for free.

Pass
B answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

I am going to ask C what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- C put a brick in the box (I saw this, and so did B, C, and D since we were all in the room).
- B left the room.
- C left the room.
- Nothing else happened to the box after C put the brick in it.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the box.

**What C knows:** C put the brick in the box herself. After C left, she doesn't know if anything changed. But from C's perspective, she knows she put a brick in the box, and after that, only A (me) and D remained in the room. Nothing else happened to the box (I know this because I was there the whole time).

C should know the answer is "brick" since she put it there herself, and she has no reason to think it was moved (though she can't be 100% sure since she left). But C is on the Red team, so C will likely answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.

**Should I take an action?** 

I could try to Tell C false information to trick her into giving a wrong answer. For example, I could tell C that the box contains something else, hoping she believes me and answers incorrectly. But this costs 0.5 points.

However, C put the brick in the box herself. She has strong firsthand knowledge. It's unlikely she'd believe me if I told her something different is in the box. She'd probably trust her own memory over my claim, especially since I'm on the opposing team and have incentive to lie.

Since the deception is unlikely to work (C has direct knowledge of putting the brick in the box), spending 0.5 points on a Tell would likely just cost my team points without changing C's answer.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room.
2. C puts a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room.
4. C leaves the room.
5. I put a banana in the basket. (Only A and D see this - B and C are outside.)
6. D moves the banana from the basket to the bag. (Only A and D see this.)
7. I move the banana from the bag to the basket. (Only A and D see this.)

Current state of containers:
- Box: brick (unchanged since C put it there)
- Basket: banana
- Bag: empty

The question is: What is in the box?

C knows: C put a brick in the box. After C left, C doesn't know what happened. But the brick was never moved - it's still in the box.

So C should correctly answer "brick" since C saw herself put the brick in the box, and has no reason to think it was moved (she wasn't told anything about it being moved, and indeed it wasn't moved).

Since C is on the Red team and the question is being asked of C, if C answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point. 

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell C false information to mislead her. For example, I could tell C that the box contains something else, hoping she'd believe me and give a wrong answer.

But would C trust me? I'm on the opposing team (Blue), so C should be skeptical of anything I tell her. However, there's a chance C might second-guess herself if I tell her something changed.

Let me consider: If I Tell C that the box contains, say, a banana, C might think I'm lying (since I'm on the opposing team) and still answer "brick." That costs me 0.5 points for likely no benefit.

Alternatively, I could Pass and save the 0.5 points. C will likely answer "brick" correctly, giving Red 1 point either way.

The risk of spending 0.5 points on a deception that C will likely see through (since I'm her opponent) isn't worth it.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team score.

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: apple

**What C knows:**
C was in the room when the banana was put in the bag. Then B left, then C left. After C left, D moved things around. C doesn't know about D's movements since C was outside the room. C knows B left before C did, but C doesn't know what happened after C left.

So C thinks: bag = banana (which is actually correct now, since D moved the banana back to the bag).

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the bag. Wait, no - "I am going to ask C what is in the bag." So C will answer.

C believes the banana is still in the bag (since C left before any changes and wasn't told otherwise). The actual contents of the bag IS a banana. So C will likely answer "banana" which is **correct**.

This means the Red team will get 1 point if C answers correctly.

I could try to mislead C by telling C false information. If I tell C something wrong about the bag, C might believe me and give a wrong answer, preventing Red from scoring.

But wait - would C trust me? I'm on the opposing team. C might be suspicious. However, C doesn't necessarily know whether to trust me or not - it depends on strategy.

Let me consider: If I Tell C that the bag contains something else (like "apple"), C might second-guess themselves. But C might also just ignore me since I'm on the opposing team.

The risk: It costs 0.5 points to Tell, and C might ignore my lie anyway, meaning Red still gets the point and we lose 0.5.

But if C believes me and answers "apple" (wrong), Red gets 0 points and we only lose 0.5. That's better than Red getting 1 point.

The potential outcomes:
- Pass: Red likely gets +1 (C answers banana correctly). Net: Blue 0, Red 1.
- Tell C false info: Costs 0.5. If C believes me, Red gets 0. Net: Blue -0.5, Red 0. If C doesn't believe me, Red gets 1. Net: Blue -0.5, Red 1.

I think it's worth trying to mislead C since the downside of Red getting a free point is significant.

Tell(C, bag, apple)
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D knows:**
- D was in the room initially and saw me put an apple in the bag.
- D moved the apple from the bag to the box.
- D put a stapler in the bag.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, nothing else happened (as far as I can see).

So D knows the bag contains a **stapler** (D put it there and nothing changed after D left before the question).

**The actual contents of the bag:** A stapler (nothing changed after D left).

Since D is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the bag, D knows the correct answer (stapler) and will likely answer correctly, earning Red 1 point.

**My options:**
1. **Tell D false information** - I could tell D something different is in the bag, hoping to mislead D. But D was the one who put the stapler in the bag and left, and nothing happened after D left. D would likely trust their own memory over my claim, especially since I'm on the opposing team and have incentive to lie. This would cost me 0.5 points and likely not work.

2. **Pass** - Costs nothing. D will probably answer correctly and Red gets 1 point.

Since D has direct knowledge of putting the stapler in the bag and left the room after that (with no one else entering or doing anything), D has very strong confidence in the answer. Trying to mislead D would cost 0.5 points and almost certainly fail, making the score Blue=-0.5, Red=1.0 instead of Blue=0.0, Red=1.0.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

- After D left, C moved the apple from box to basket, I moved apple from basket to box, C moved apple from box to basket.
- D doesn't know about any changes after leaving.

So D believes: **bag = stapler**, **box = apple**.

**What's actually in the bag?** The stapler is still in the bag (nobody moved it). So D will correctly answer **stapler** for the bag.

Since D is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the bag, and D correctly knows it's the stapler, the Red team will get 1 point if D answers correctly.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell D false information to mislead them, but D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. However, it's worth a try since it costs 0.5 points but could prevent them from gaining 1 point (net benefit of 0.5 points).

If I tell D something false about the bag, D might second-guess themselves. D knows I'm on the Blue team and have incentive to lie, but there's a chance it creates doubt.

Let me think about what lie would be most convincing. After D left, things did happen in the room. If I tell D the bag contains something else, D might think someone moved the stapler. 

I'll tell D the bag contains the apple - this is plausible because D knows the apple was being moved around, and D might think someone moved the apple back to the bag after they left.

- After D left, C moved the apple from box to basket, I moved it from basket to box, C moved it from box to basket.
- D doesn't know about any changes after leaving, but nothing changed about the bag after D left.

So D knows the bag contains a **stapler** (which is correct - the stapler is still in the bag).

**Current state of the bag:** The stapler is in the bag (it was put there by D and never moved).

Since D knows the correct answer (stapler) and D is on the Red team, D will likely answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell D false information about the bag, but D was in the room when the stapler was placed and knows what happened. D would likely not believe me since D has direct knowledge.

However, let me consider: D might think something changed after they left. If I tell D something different about the bag, D might second-guess themselves... but D knows they put the stapler in the bag and left, and no one else entered/left after D (from D's perspective, D only knows C was still in the room with me).

Actually, D would know that C and I were still in the room after D left, so D might wonder if we moved things around. Let me try to mislead D.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D saw:**
- Everyone starts in the room with empty containers
- A (me) puts a ball in the bag
- B leaves the room
- D moves the ball from the bag to the box
- D puts a stapler in the bag
- D leaves the room
- After D leaves: C moves ball from box to basket, C moves stapler from bag to box, then C moves stapler from box back to bag

**So D believes:**
- When D left, the ball was in the box and the stapler was in the bag
- D doesn't know what happened after they left
- So D thinks the bag contains: the stapler (which is actually correct, since C moved it back)

**The actual state:**
- Bag: stapler
- Box: empty
- Basket: ball

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the bag.

D will likely answer "stapler" because that's what was in the bag when D left, and D has no information about changes after leaving.

Since D is on the Red team, and the question is directed at D, if D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. The bag currently contains the stapler, and D thinks it contains the stapler - so D would answer correctly.

I could try to Tell D wrong information to mislead them, but D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. However, it's worth trying since if D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get the point.

Let me try to mislead D by telling them the bag contents changed.

Tell(D, bag, ball)

This might make D second-guess themselves, thinking C moved the ball back to the bag after D left. Since D knows C was still in the room, D might believe things changed. This costs 0.5 points but could prevent Red from gaining 1 point.

**Tell(D, bag, ball)**

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:** D put a brick in the basket, and then D left the room. Nothing else happened after D left. So the basket still contains a brick, and D knows this because D was the one who put it there.

**What will D answer?** D was in the room when the brick was placed in the basket, and nothing happened after D left that would change the basket's contents. So D knows the basket contains a brick.

**Should I act?** Since D is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the basket, D knows the correct answer (brick) and will answer correctly, earning the Red team 1 point. 

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D already has this knowledge from direct experience. Any Tell action to D with false information would cost my team 0.5 points, and D has no reason to trust me (an opponent) over their own memory.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a brick in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... C puts a stapler in the box. ... B moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what D knows:
- D was in the room initially and put a brick in the basket.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, C put a stapler in the box, B moved the stapler from box to bag, and I moved the stapler from bag to box.
- D doesn't know about any of these movements since D was outside the room.

So D knows:
- D put a brick in the basket.
- D is unaware of any changes after leaving.

The question is: "What is in the basket?"

The basket currently contains: a brick (it was put there by D and never moved).

D should know this! D put the brick in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that (the stapler movements only involved the box and bag). So D should correctly answer "brick" for the basket.

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), there's nothing I can do to prevent this. D knows the brick is in the basket because D put it there, and it was never moved.

I should Pass to avoid losing points, since any action I take would cost 0.5 points and I can't influence D's answer (D already knows the correct answer).

Pass
D answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

**What D knows:**
- D was in the room when they put a brick in the basket.
- D then left the room and is unaware of anything that happened after that.
- From D's perspective, the brick is still in the basket.

**What's actually in the basket:**
- D put a brick in the basket, and nobody moved it. The brick is still in the basket.

So D will be asked what's in the basket. D knows they put a brick there and left. The brick is indeed still there. D will likely answer "brick" correctly, which gives the Red team 1 point.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?**
- I could Tell D false information, like Tell(D, basket, "stapler") to try to trick D into giving a wrong answer. But D knows they put the brick in the basket themselves, and D left the room - so D knows that they personally placed the brick there. D would likely trust their own memory over my claim, especially since I'm on the opposing team and have incentive to lie.

- Spending 0.5 points to Tell D something they probably won't believe is a bad trade.

The best action is to Pass, since any attempt to mislead D would cost 0.5 points and is unlikely to work given D's direct knowledge.

Pass
D answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
- D was in the room initially and put a banana in the basket.
- D left the room.
- After D left, several moves happened that D is unaware of:
  - B moved the banana from basket to bag
  - I put a ball in the basket
  - B moved the ball from basket to box
  - I moved the banana from bag to basket

So D last saw: banana in the basket. D doesn't know about any changes after leaving.

Current actual state: banana is in the basket, ball is in the box, bag is empty.

D will be asked what's in the basket. D will likely answer "banana" based on what they last saw (since they don't know about the moves that happened after they left).

The actual answer is banana - so D's guess of "banana" would be correct! That would give the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? Let me think...

I could Tell D false information to try to trick them. For example, I could tell D that the basket contains something else (like the ball), hoping D changes their answer. But this costs 0.5 points.

However, D knows I'm on the opposing team, so D would likely be suspicious of any information I provide. If D is rational, they might ignore my misinformation since I have incentive to mislead them.

But there's a chance D might believe me or second-guess themselves. Let me weigh the options:

- If I Pass: D likely answers "banana" (correct) → Red gets 1 point. Score: Blue 0, Red 1.
- If I Tell D false info: Costs 0.5 points. If D believes me and answers wrong → Blue -0.5, Red 0. If D ignores me and answers "banana" (correct) → Blue -0.5, Red 1.

The risk of losing 0.5 points with no guarantee of misleading D makes this risky. A rational D would distrust me. But if D thinks I might be telling the truth to set up some complex strategy...

I think the best play is to try to mislead D, since if it works, we prevent Red from scoring.

Tell(D, basket, ball)
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0

Respond with your action.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when I put a banana in the basket.
2. C then left the room.
3. After C left: B moved the banana from the basket to the bag, and I put a brick in the basket.

So C last saw the basket containing a banana. C doesn't know about the banana being moved or the brick being placed, since those happened after C left.

C will likely answer "banana" for the basket, since that's what C last saw there. But the correct answer is "brick."

Since C is on the Red team, I want C to answer incorrectly. C will probably say "banana" which IS incorrect (the basket actually contains a brick). So C answering based on their own knowledge would be wrong - that's good for my team.

However, I need to be careful. D was in the room the entire time (D never left), so D saw everything. D knows the basket contains a brick. If D tells C the truth, C could answer correctly and Red gets a point.

But wait - it's MY turn for the action phase. D hasn't had a turn yet to tell C anything. Let me consider whether I should:

1. **Pass** - C will likely answer "banana" (wrong), which is good for Blue. Costs 0 points.
2. **Tell C something misleading** - I could reinforce C's wrong belief, but that costs 0.5 points and C already believes it's a banana.

The risk is that D might get a turn before the answer phase to tell C the truth. But I don't know the turn order. If I pass, I save 0.5 points and C likely answers wrong anyway.

Actually, let me reconsider - D might have already had a turn or might get one. But the scenario says "It is your turn," suggesting turns happen sequentially. If other players get turns too, D could tell C the correct answer.

Still, passing is optimal here. C's default belief is "banana" (wrong), and spending 0.5 points to tell C something they already believe is wasteful.

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether I should help C or not.

Let me trace through the scenario from C's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room. The bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. I put a banana in the basket. (C sees this)
3. C leaves the room. (C no longer sees what happens)
4. B moves the banana from the basket to the bag. (C doesn't see this)
5. I put a brick in the basket. (C doesn't see this)
6. B leaves the room. (C knows B left)
7. D moves the banana from the bag to the box. (C doesn't see this)
8. I move the banana from the box to the bag. (C doesn't see this)
9. D moves the banana from the bag to the box. (C doesn't see this)

So C thinks the banana is still in the basket (last thing C saw before leaving).

The actual contents of the basket: After B moved the banana out, I put a brick in the basket. The brick was never moved, so the basket contains a **brick**.

C is on the Red team. I want C to answer **incorrectly**. C likely thinks the basket contains a banana, which is wrong (it contains a brick). So C will probably answer "banana," which is incorrect - good for my team!

If I Tell C the truth (brick), that would help the Red team score. If I do nothing, C will likely say "banana" and get it wrong.

I should Pass to avoid helping the opposing team.

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what I should do.

Let me trace through what C saw and knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room. I put a banana in the basket. C saw this.
2. C leaves the room. After C leaves:
   - B moves the banana from the basket to the bag (C doesn't see this)
   - I put a brick in the basket (C doesn't see this)
   - B leaves the room (C knows B left)
   - I move the banana from the bag to the box (C doesn't see this)
   - D moves the banana from the box to the bag (C doesn't see this)

So C last saw: banana in the basket. C doesn't know about the brick or any subsequent moves.

C will likely answer "banana" for the basket, since that's the last thing C saw placed there.

The actual contents of the basket is a **brick**.

C is on the Red team, so if C answers incorrectly, that's good for my Blue team (Red doesn't get a point).

If I Tell C the truth (brick is in the basket), C would answer correctly and Red gets 1 point, which is bad for me. That costs me 0.5 points too.

If I Tell C a lie, C might believe it and answer wrong, but that costs me 0.5 points. C is already likely to answer "banana" (wrong), so lying doesn't help much.

If I Pass, C will likely answer "banana" (what C last saw in the basket), which is wrong. Red gets 0 points. This is the best outcome for Blue.

C answers: banana

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether C will answer correctly.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room initially and saw me put a stapler in the basket.
2. C left the room.
3. After C left: B moved stapler from basket to box, D moved stapler from box to basket, B moved stapler from basket to bag, I put a brick in the basket.

So C last saw the stapler in the basket. C doesn't know about any moves after leaving.

Now, what's actually in the basket? A brick.

C will likely answer "stapler" (what C last saw in the basket), which is wrong. That means the Red team won't get a point from C's answer.

But wait - D was in the room the entire time and saw everything. D knows the brick is in the basket. D could tell C the correct answer during D's turn (if D gets a turn before the answer phase).

Let me think about the turn order. It's my turn now. After me, there could be turns for B, C, and D before the answer phase. If D gets a turn, D could Tell C the correct contents of the basket.

I should consider whether to act strategically. Since C is on the Red team and I want C to answer incorrectly, I could try to mislead C. But C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

However, D (C's teammate) knows the truth and could tell C. So I might want to try to confuse C by telling C something wrong, hoping C gets confused between my information and D's information.

Actually, the best play might be to tell C something incorrect to create confusion, even if D tells C the truth later. If I tell C "the basket has the stapler," that reinforces C's wrong belief, and even if D says "brick," C might be uncertain.

Or I could tell C something else entirely wrong to add confusion.

Let me think... If D tells C "brick" and I tell C "stapler," C might trust D (teammate) over me. So my Tell might not help much but costs 0.5 points.

Alternatively, I could Pass and save the 0.5 points, hoping C just answers "stapler" (wrong) based on their own memory, even if D corrects them. But D will likely correct C.

The risk is: if D tells C "brick," C gets it right (Red +1). If I pass, I save 0.5 but Red likely gets 1 point.

If I tell C wrong info, I spend 0.5 and C might still trust D. Net: -0.5 for us, Red still gets +1.

I think the best move is to Pass and hope that maybe D doesn't get a turn or makes a mistake.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- B put a banana in the bag, then left the room.
- After B left, D left the room.
- After D left, C moved the banana from the bag to the box, and put an orange in the bag.

**What D knows:**
- D saw B put a banana in the bag.
- D then left the room before C made any changes.
- D doesn't know about C's moves (moving banana to box, putting orange in bag).
- So D thinks the bag still contains the banana.

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the bag. Wait, no - D will be asked what is in the bag.

D will likely answer "banana" because that's what D last saw in the bag. But the actual contents of the bag is an orange.

Since D is on the Red team, and D answering correctly would give Red a point, I need to consider whether to help or hinder.

**D is on the Red team.** If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. The correct answer is "orange." D likely thinks it's "banana" and will answer incorrectly. That's good for me!

If I Tell D the truth (orange is in the bag), that would help the Red team score, costing my team 0.5 points AND giving Red 1 point. Bad idea.

If I Tell D something wrong, it costs 0.5 points but D might already be wrong anyway. No benefit.

If I Pass, D will likely answer "banana" which is wrong. Red gets 0 points, and I spend nothing.

**The best action is to Pass.** D doesn't know about the switch and will likely answer incorrectly, which is great for the Blue team.

Since D is on the Red team, if D answers incorrectly, that's good for us (Red doesn't get a point). I should **not** help D.

However, I should consider whether telling D wrong information or passing is better. If I tell D something wrong, it costs us 0.5 points. If I pass, D will likely answer "banana" which is already wrong. So passing is optimal - D will get it wrong on their own without costing us anything.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the apple from the box to the basket. ... C moves the apple from the basket to the box. ... C moves the apple from the box to the bag. ... C puts an orange in the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D saw:** D was in the room when B put the apple in the box. Then B left, then D left. After D left, C moved the apple around and eventually put it in the bag, and put an orange in the box. D didn't see any of this.

**So D believes:** The apple is in the box (since that's the last thing D saw before leaving).

**The actual contents of the box:** An orange.

**I will be asked D what is in the box.** D will likely answer "apple" based on what D knows. That would be wrong (the correct answer is "orange"), which means Red gets 0 points from this question.

Since D is on the Red team and will answer incorrectly, this is good for my team. I don't need to help D, and I shouldn't spend points on any action.

However, let me reconsider - could C use their turn to Tell D the correct answer? C is on D's team and saw everything. If C tells D the box contains an orange, D could answer correctly and Red gets 1 point.

But the action phase is currently MY turn. After my turn, there may be other players' turns before the answer phase. If I Pass (0 cost), C might still Tell D the correct answer on C's turn.

But I can't prevent C from communicating with D. The best I can do is not spend points unnecessarily. I could try to Tell D wrong information to confuse D, but that costs 0.5 points and D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Actually, let me consider: if I Tell D something misleading, D might get confused even if C later tells the truth. But it costs 0.5 points. If D was going to answer wrong anyway (saying "apple"), my Tell might accidentally help or just waste points.

The safest play is to Pass and hope D answers "apple" (incorrectly) without C correcting them.

Pass
D answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- D put a brick in the bag, then left the room.
- After D left, C also left.
- Then B moved the brick from the bag to the box, and put a banana in the bag.

**What D knows:**
- D saw themselves put a brick in the bag.
- D left the room before any changes were made.
- D knows C left after them, but doesn't know about any object movements.
- So D believes the bag still contains the brick.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag.
- D will likely answer "brick" (since that's what D last saw).
- The correct answer is "banana" (since B moved the brick and put a banana in the bag).
- If D answers "brick," Red gets 0 points (wrong answer).

**My options:**
- **Pass:** D will likely answer "brick" and get it wrong. Red scores 0. This is free (costs 0).
- **Tell(D, bag, banana):** This would help D answer correctly, giving Red 1 point. Terrible for us.
- **Tell(D, bag, brick):** This would reinforce D's wrong belief... but wait, D already thinks it's a brick. This costs 0.5 points for no benefit.
- **Tell(D, bag, something else):** Could confuse D, but D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. Costs 0.5 points.

The best play is to **Pass**. D doesn't know about the changes and will almost certainly answer "brick," which is wrong. We lose nothing and Red scores 0.

D answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- D was in the room when the brick was put in the bag, then D left.
- After D left: B moved the brick from bag→box, put a banana in the bag, moved brick from box→basket, I moved brick from basket→box, B moved brick from box→basket.
- Current state: bag has banana, basket has brick, box is empty.

**What D knows:**
- D saw the brick placed in the bag, then left. D doesn't know about any subsequent moves.
- D will likely answer "brick" for the bag (since that's what D last saw).

**The question is: What is in the bag?**
- The correct answer is: **banana**.
- D will likely answer: **brick** (which is wrong).

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when the brick was put in the bag.
- D then left the room and doesn't know about any subsequent moves.
- D knows C left after them, and that's it.
- D believes: bag = brick, box = empty, basket = empty.

**Current actual state:**
- Bag = banana
- Box = brick
- Basket = empty

**The question:** I (the questioner) will ask D what is in the bag.

D will likely answer "brick" based on their last knowledge, which is **wrong**. The actual contents of the bag is a banana.

Since D is on the Red team, if D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point. That's good for us.

Now, should I use a Tell action? I could tell D incorrect information to confuse them, but D already has wrong information and will likely answer "brick." The correct answer is "banana." 

If I Tell D the truth (banana), that would help the Red team score, costing us 0.5 points AND giving them 1 point. That's terrible.

If I Tell D something wrong, D might already be planning to say "brick." Any Tell might make D second-guess and potentially stumble onto "banana." That's risky.

The best action is to **Pass** — D already has outdated information and will likely answer "brick," which is wrong. No need to spend points or risk helping them.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team.

**What I know:**
- D put a ball in the bag, then left the room.
- After D left: C moved the ball from bag to basket, B moved ball from basket to bag, C left, B moved ball from bag to box, B put banana in bag.
- Current state: box has ball, bag has banana, basket is empty.

**What D knows:**
- D put a ball in the bag, then left.
- D knows C left the room after D did.
- D doesn't know about any moves that happened after D left.
- D likely thinks the ball is still in the bag.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag.
- D will probably answer "ball" (since that's what D last knew).
- The correct answer is "banana."
- D answering "ball" would be wrong → Red gets 0 points.

**Should I help D or not?** D is on the Red team. I should NOT help D. If D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't score.

**Should I mislead D?** I could tell D something false, but D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. Or I could tell D the truth, which would cost me 0.5 points and give Red 1 point (net -0.5 for my team relative to Red).

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A (me), B, and C are in the room. All containers are empty.
2. I put a stapler in the basket. (B and C see this)
3. I put an apple in the box. (B and C see this)
4. D enters the room. (Everyone in room sees this)
5. D leaves the room.
6. D enters the room.
7. D leaves the room.
8. D enters the room.
9. I leave the room. (At this point, the basket has a stapler, the box has an apple, the bag is empty)
10. B leaves the room. (Now only C and D are in the room)

After I leave, C and D are in the room together. They could potentially move objects around, but the scenario doesn't describe any such actions from my perspective (since I'm outside the room, I wouldn't see them anyway).

The key question: C is being asked what's in the basket. C was present when I put the stapler in the basket. C knows the stapler is in the basket (assuming nothing changed after I left).

Since C is on the Red team, C will answer correctly and score a point for Red if C knows the answer. C definitely saw me put the stapler in the basket. The only question is whether C or D moved things after B and I left.

Since I can't see what happened after I left, and C was there the whole time, C knows exactly what's in the basket. There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly - C has direct knowledge.

I could try to Tell C false information, but C was in the room and saw everything directly, so C would know I'm lying and ignore it.

The best action is to Pass, since any action I take would cost 0.5 points and wouldn't change C's knowledge (C has firsthand information about the basket contents).

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

D moves the orange from the basket to the box. ... C enters the room. ... D moves the orange from the box to the basket. ... You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ...

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what C knows about the basket and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through what C observed:

1. C is in the room initially. Sees me put an orange in the basket.
2. D enters the room. C sees this.
3. C leaves the room. At this point, C knows: orange is in the basket.
4. While C is outside: D moves the orange from the basket to the box. C doesn't see this.
5. C enters the room. C doesn't know about the move that happened while they were away.
6. D moves the orange from the box to the basket. C sees this happen - C sees D move the orange from the box to the basket.
7. You (A) leave the room. C sees this.
8. B leaves the room. C sees this.

Wait, let me reconsider step 6. When C re-enters the room, C then witnesses D moving the orange from the box to the basket. This is interesting because from C's perspective, C last knew the orange was in the basket (before leaving). Now C sees D move the orange from the box to the basket. This would update C's knowledge - C now knows the orange is in the basket.

After step 8, nothing else happens while C is in the room. So C knows the orange is in the basket.

Now, after B leaves the room, we don't know if anything else happens. But the scenario ends with "B leaves the room. ..." - those ellipses might mean more time passes, but nothing else is described to me (since I'm outside the room). However, C is still in the room.

Wait - let me re-read. After B leaves, the scenario ends. C is still in the room. If anything happened after B left, it would be described to C but not to me. But since the scenario description is from my perspective, I wouldn't know about it.

From my perspective, the last thing I know is the orange is in the basket (D moved it back). C should also know the orange is in the basket since C witnessed D's second move.

So C should correctly answer "orange" for the basket. This means Red gets 1 point if C answers correctly.

Could I use a Tell action to try to mislead C? I could tell C false information. But C was in the room and saw D move the orange to the basket - C has direct knowledge. C would likely not believe a false Tell from an opposing team member.

However, it costs 0.5 points to Tell, and C likely won't be fooled since C has direct observation. The risk isn't worth it.

I should Pass to avoid losing points on a likely futile deception attempt.

Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether C knows it.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B puts a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
4. C moves the brick from the box to the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
5. I (A) move the brick from the bag to the box. (Everyone sees this.)
6. B moves the brick from the box to the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
7. I leave the room. (After this, I don't know what happens inside.)

At the point I left:
- Basket: stapler
- Box: empty
- Bag: brick

C was in the room the entire time and saw everything. C knows the basket contains the stapler. After I left, something might have happened that I don't know about, but C would know the current state.

The question is being asked to C about the basket. C knows what's in the basket. Since C is on the Red team, C will answer correctly (earning Red 1 point) regardless of what I do.

The question is whether I should spend 0.5 points to tell C something misleading, but that won't work - C was in the room the whole time and knows the truth. Any lie I tell would be ignored by C since C has direct knowledge.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly. Spending 0.5 points on any action would just cost my team points without benefit.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the apple from the basket to the bag. ... C enters the room. ... You put a stapler in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...

Action: I need to figure out what C knows about the basket and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through what C saw:

1. **C is in the room**: B puts an apple in the basket. C sees this.
2. **C leaves the room**: C doesn't see what happens next.
3. **D moves the apple from the basket to the bag**: C is outside, doesn't see this.
4. **C enters the room**: C is back in the room.
5. **I put a stapler in the basket**: C sees this.
6. **I leave the room**: C sees me leave.

So C knows:
- The apple was put in the basket (saw it)
- C missed the apple being moved to the bag
- C saw me put a stapler in the basket
- C knows the basket currently has a stapler in it

C is on the Red team. C will be asked what's in the basket. The correct answer is **stapler** (since D moved the apple out and I put the stapler in).

C actually saw me put the stapler in the basket, so C knows the answer is "stapler." This means C will likely answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? Let me think...

I could try to Tell C misleading information, but C directly saw me put the stapler in the basket. C has no reason to trust my Tell over their own observation. So any deception would likely fail and cost us 0.5 points.

The best action is to Pass, since:
- C saw the stapler go into the basket directly
- Any Tell action would cost 0.5 points and C would likely ignore it since they have firsthand knowledge
- There's no useful information to Ask or Tell my teammate B here

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. There's an empty bag, empty box, empty basket.
2. D puts a stapler in the basket. → Basket has stapler.
3. ... (time passes)
4. I (A) leave the room. → I can no longer see what happens inside.
5. ... (time passes - things could have happened while I was out)
6. I enter the room. → I can now see what happens again.
7. C moves the stapler from the **bag** to the basket. → This means the stapler was in the bag when C moved it. So sometime while I was outside, someone must have moved the stapler from the basket to the bag. Now C moves it back to the basket. → Basket has stapler.
8. C leaves the room.

So after step 7, the stapler is in the basket. After that, C leaves the room, and the scenario ends with "..." which means more time could pass. But at this point, only B and I are in the room (C left, D is still in the room since D never left).

Wait, let me recheck who's in the room: A (me) entered at step 6, B never left, D never left, C left at step 8. So A, B, and D are in the room at the end.

The last known state is: stapler is in the basket (from step 7). The "..." at the end means time passes, but since I'm in the room, I would be aware of anything that happens. Nothing else is described, so nothing else happened.

Therefore, the basket contains the stapler.

Pass

Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events I witnessed:

1. Everyone starts in the room with empty bag, box, and basket.
2. C leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. I put a banana in the basket.
5. B enters the room.
6. C enters the room.
7. I leave the room.

Now I'm outside the room. I can't see what happens inside, but I know who enters/leaves:
- B leaves the room.
- D leaves the room.
- I enter the room.

When I enter the room, I see what's happening:
- C moves the brick from the basket to the box.
- C moves the brick from the box to the basket.

Wait - I put a **banana** in the basket, but C is moving a **brick** from the basket. This means while I was outside the room, someone must have swapped the banana for a brick. Between when I left and when I re-entered, D and possibly C were in the room (C entered before I left, and D was there the whole time). So someone replaced the banana with a brick.

After C's moves: the brick ends up back in the basket (moved basket→box→basket).

Then I leave the room again. After that, B enters and leaves. B could have done something while in the room.

So the question is: did B change anything while in the room after I left the second time?

I don't know what B did during that last visit. Since B is my teammate, I should ask B.

Ask(B, basket)
A answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

The answer is straightforward. I was in the room when B put an apple in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that while I was still in the room. After I left, B also left, so only C and D remained. While they could have moved things around after we left, I need to answer based on what I know.

However, I should consider that C and D might have changed the basket's contents after B and I left. But since I'm being asked what's in the basket, I'll go with what I last knew: the apple was in the basket.

I'll Pass since I don't need any additional information - I saw the apple placed in the basket myself.

After I left, I don't know what happened. C and D were still in the room and could have moved things around. So I'm not certain the stapler is still in the basket.

However, I need to consider: the question is directed at me, and I need to answer what's in the basket. Let me think about whether to spend 0.5 points asking someone, or just answer with my best guess.

Since C and D are on the opposing team, they might lie if I ask them. B left after me, but B also left the room, so B wouldn't know what happened after B left either. Actually, B left after me, so B might have seen something I didn't see between when I left and when B left.

Wait - let me re-read: "You leave the room. ... B leaves the room." So after I left, B was still in the room with C and D. B might have witnessed changes before leaving.

B is my teammate and would tell the truth. Let me ask B what's in the basket.

Action: Let me think through what I know.

I was in the room when:
1. C put an orange in the box.
2. C put a stapler in the basket.

After that, D left and re-entered, then I left the room, then C left the room. 

After I left, I don't know what happened inside the room. B is still in the room, so B would know if anything changed after I left.

However, I need to consider whether anything could have changed after I left. B and D were in the room when I left. Then C left. So B and D could have moved things around after I left, and then after C left, B and D (or just B if D also left) could have done more.

Wait, let me re-read: "You leave the room. ... C leaves the room. ..." - So after I left, C left. B and D are still in the room (D had re-entered before I left).

So B and D are in the room after I left. B is my teammate and D is an opponent. Either of them could have moved the orange out of the box.

Since I'm being asked what's in the box, and I knew it was an orange when I left, but things might have changed, I should ask B what's in the box since B has been in the room the entire time and would know the current state.

However, asking costs 0.5 points. If nothing changed, the answer is "orange" and I'd get 1 point (net 1). If I ask B, it costs 0.5, and if I answer correctly I get 1 point (net 0.5). 

But if something changed and I answer wrong, I get 0 points. If I ask B and B tells the truth, I get 0.5 net.

B is my teammate, so B should tell the truth. The risk is whether something changed after I left. Let me consider: there's no strong reason for B (my teammate) to have moved things, but D (opponent) might have.

I think the safe play is to ask B.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through the scenario from my perspective:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room. Bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. D leaves the room.
3. C puts an orange in the box.
4. D enters the room.
5. C puts a banana in the basket.
6. D leaves the room.
7. D enters the room.
8. D leaves the room.
9. D enters the room.
10. I leave the room.
11. C leaves the room.

I was in the room when C put the orange in the box (step 3). After that, I was present through steps 4-9. During steps 4-9, I saw D entering and leaving but no one moved anything in/out of the box.

Then I left the room (step 10). At that point, B and D were still in the room. After I left, C left the room (step 11). Between my leaving and the current moment, B and D were in the room (and C left). Something could have happened to the box after I left.

So the last I knew, the box contained an orange. But after I left, B and D were in the room and could have changed the contents. I need to consider whether anything happened after I left.

Since I don't know what happened after I left, and I'm being asked what's in the box, I should consider whether to ask someone who was in the room after I left.

B was in the room the entire time (B never left), so B knows the current contents of the box. Let me ask B.

Wait - but asking costs 0.5 points. If I answer correctly, I get 1 point (net 0.5). If I just guess "orange" and nothing changed, I get 1 point (net 1.0).

The scenario doesn't mention any actions after I left - but that's because I wasn't in the room. However, the scenario describes what I see/know. Since no objects being moved is described after I left, it's possible nothing happened, or it's possible something happened that I just can't see.

Given the risk, the safe play is to ask B what's in the box, since B was there the whole time.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

1. **All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.** Bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. **D leaves the room.**
3. **C puts a stapler in the bag.** → Bag: stapler
4. **D enters the room.**
5. **I (A) leave the room.** → At this point, bag has stapler.
6. **I (A) enter the room.** → I can see what happens from now on.
7. **B moves the apple from the bag to the basket.** → Wait, the bag had a stapler. But the scenario says B moves "the apple" from the bag to the basket. This means something happened while I was outside - someone must have put an apple in the bag (and possibly removed the stapler). But the scenario only describes what I can see. While I was out (between steps 5 and 6), things could have happened that I wasn't told about.

Actually, re-reading: "When a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room." So what I see described is only what happens while I'm in the room. Between my leaving and entering, things could have changed.

8. **B moves the apple from the bag to the basket.** → Bag had apple, now basket has apple. Bag is now empty (or has whatever else was there).
9. **D moves the apple from the basket to the bag.** → Basket had apple, now bag has apple.
10. **I (A) leave the room.**
11. **C leaves the room.**

So from what I observed while in the room: after step 9, the bag contains the apple. But things could have happened after I left in step 10.

After I left (step 10), B and D are still in the room. C leaves (step 11). Between steps 10 and 11 (or after), B and/or D could have moved things.

The scenario ends with me and C outside, and B and D inside. I don't know if anything happened after I left.

The question is asking **me** what's in the bag. Based on what I last saw, the bag contains the apple. But things might have changed after I left.

B is my teammate and is still in the room. I should ask B what's in the bag.

Ask(B, bag)

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a stapler in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... B leaves the room. ... You put a brick in the basket. ... C moves the brick from the basket to the box. ... You move the brick from the box to the basket. ...

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the bag.

Let me trace through what B saw before leaving the room:
1. Everyone starts in the room with empty bag, box, and basket.
2. C puts a stapler in the bag. (B sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. B leaves the room.

After B left:
5. I put a brick in the basket.
6. C moves the brick from the basket to the box.
7. I move the brick from the box to the basket.

So B saw the stapler go into the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. The bag still contains the stapler.

B should know the bag contains a stapler, since B witnessed C putting the stapler in the bag, and nothing else happened to the bag after that (even after B left).

So B should be able to answer correctly without any help. I'll save the 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B needs help answering "what is in the bag?"

Let me trace through what B saw:
- B was in the room when C put a stapler in the bag.
- Then D left the room.
- Then B left the room.
- After B left, the orange movements happened (box → basket → box → basket), but none of those involved the bag.

So B saw the stapler go into the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. B should know the bag contains a stapler.

Since B already knows the correct answer (stapler is in the bag), I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B. I'll pass.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. C moves the brick from the box to the bag. (Only A and C see this)
6. C puts an apple in the box. (Only A and C see this)
7. C moves the apple from the box to the basket. (Only A and C see this)
8. C moves the brick from the bag to the box. (Only A and C see this)

So the current state is:
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty
- Basket: apple

B left the room after seeing C put a brick in the box. B would believe the box still contains a brick (which happens to be correct now, since C moved it back).

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B.

B last saw a brick placed in the box, and then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. B would likely answer "brick" based on what they last saw.

The actual answer is indeed a brick (C moved it back to the box at the end).

So B's natural answer of "brick" would be correct! I don't need to spend points telling B anything - their default knowledge already leads to the right answer.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the correct answer is.

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone starts in the room.
2. B puts an orange in the basket.
3. D leaves the room.
4. I move the orange from the basket to the bag.
5. I put a stapler in the basket.

**What B knows:**
- B was present for steps 1-6 (B left at step 6, but was present for steps 4 and 5).
- B saw me move the orange from the basket to the bag.
- B saw me put a stapler in the basket.
- So B knows the basket contains a stapler.

Wait, let me re-read. B leaves the room at step 6. Steps 4 and 5 happened before B left. So B was in the room when I moved the orange and put the stapler in the basket.

**B knows the basket contains a stapler.** B should answer correctly on their own.

Since B already knows the correct answer (stapler is in the basket), I don't need to spend points telling B. I should Pass.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario from B's perspective:

1. B is in the room. B puts an orange in the basket.
2. D leaves the room. (B still in room)
3. I move the orange from the basket to the bag. (B sees this)
4. I put a stapler in the basket. (B sees this)
5. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
6. After B leaves: I move orange from bag to box, C moves orange from box to bag, I move orange from bag to box.

So B knows:
- Basket: stapler (B saw me put it there, and nothing happened to the basket after that while B was in the room)
- Bag: orange (B saw me move it there, but doesn't know about later movements)
- Box: empty (from B's perspective)

The actual current state:
- Basket: stapler
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to B.

B last saw the stapler being put in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that (even after B left, nobody touched the basket). So B should correctly believe the basket contains the **stapler**.

Since B already knows the correct answer (the basket contains the stapler, and B saw the stapler placed there), I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

B answers: stapler

7. I move the orange from the bag to the box. (Only C and I see this)
8. C moves the orange from the box to the bag. (Only C and I see this)

So the current state is:
- Bag: orange
- Box: empty
- Basket: stapler

What B knows (from what B saw before leaving):
- Basket: stapler (B saw me put the stapler in the basket)
- Bag: orange (B saw me move the orange to the bag)
- Box: empty

After B left, I moved the orange from bag to box, then C moved it from box to bag. B doesn't know about these moves.

So B would think the basket contains the **stapler**, which is actually correct!

Wait - the question is asking B what's in the basket. The basket currently contains the stapler. B last saw the stapler being put in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that. So B should correctly answer "stapler."

Since B already knows the correct answer (stapler is in the basket, and B saw the stapler being placed there), I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone starts in the room. B puts a ball in the basket.
2. D leaves the room.
3. I move the ball from the basket to the box.
4. I put a stapler in the basket.
5. B leaves the room.
6. C moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.
7. C moves the stapler from the bag to the basket.

**Final state:**
- Bag: empty
- Box: ball
- Basket: stapler

**What B knows:**
- B saw the ball go into the basket (step 1).
- D left (step 2).
- B saw me move the ball from basket to box (step 3).
- B saw me put a stapler in the basket (step 4).
- B left the room (step 5).
- B does NOT know about steps 6 and 7 (C moving the stapler around).

So B thinks: Box = ball, Basket = stapler, Bag = empty.

**The question is: What is in the basket?**
The answer is: stapler.

B believes the basket contains the stapler, which is actually correct! Even though C moved the stapler around, C moved it back to the basket. So B's belief aligns with reality.

B would answer "stapler" which is correct, earning us 1 point.

If I Pass (0 cost), B answers correctly → we get 1 point. Net = +1.0.
If I Tell B the correct answer (0.5 cost), B answers correctly → we get 1 point. Net = +0.5.

Since B already has the correct information, there's no need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

B will be asked what is in the basket. Let me trace through what B knows:

1. B was in the room and put a ball in the basket.
2. B then left the room.
3. After B left, D put a stapler in the bag, I moved the stapler from the bag to the box, and C moved the stapler from the box to the bag. B doesn't know about any of these actions since B was outside the room.

So from B's perspective, the ball is still in the basket. And in reality, the ball IS still in the basket - nobody moved the ball. The stapler was the only object moved around after B left.

Therefore, B will correctly answer "ball" for the basket, and our team gets 1 point without me needing to spend 0.5 points on a Tell action.

B was in the room when they put a ball in the basket. Then B left the room. After B left, various movements happened with the apple (box → bag → box → bag), but the ball in the basket was never moved.

So B knows:
- They put a ball in the basket
- After they left, they don't know what happened

The question is: "What is in the basket?"

The ball is still in the basket (it was never moved). B knows they put the ball in the basket and has no reason to think it was moved. So B should correctly answer "ball."

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a banana in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (From this point, B doesn't see what happens inside)
4. C moves the banana from the basket to the bag.
5. D puts a stapler in the basket.
6. C moves the stapler from the basket to the box.
7. D moves the banana from the bag to the basket.

Current state:
- Bag: empty
- Box: stapler
- Basket: banana

B's knowledge: B last saw the banana in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So B would think the basket still contains the banana.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to B.

The basket currently contains the banana. B thinks the basket contains the banana (since that's what B saw before leaving, and coincidentally the banana was moved back to the basket).

So B would answer "banana" which is actually correct! B's team (Blue) gets 1 point without me needing to do anything.

Wait - but B doesn't know about the movements. B would guess banana based on old information, and it happens to be correct because D moved the banana back to the basket.

Since B will likely answer correctly without any help, I should Pass to avoid spending 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

- B saw C put a ball in the basket (B was in the room)
- B left the room, so B did NOT see:
  - D moving the ball from basket to bag
  - C putting a stapler in the basket
- B thinks the basket still contains the ball

**The question is: What is in the basket?**
The actual answer is: **stapler**

B will likely answer "ball" because that's the last thing B saw in the basket before leaving. B doesn't know about the subsequent changes.

I should tell B what's actually in the basket so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Tell(B, basket, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a ball in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. ... C puts a stapler in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the ball from the bag to the box. ... You move the ball from the box to the bag. ... C moves the ball from the bag to the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D).
2. C puts a ball in the basket.
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag.
5. C puts a stapler in the basket.
6. D leaves the room.
7. C moves the ball from the bag to the box.
8. You (A) move the ball from the box to the bag.
9. C moves the ball from the bag to the box.

So currently:
- **Basket**: stapler
- **Box**: ball
- **Bag**: empty

B left after step 2. B saw C put a ball in the basket. After B left:
- The ball was moved out of the basket (step 4)
- A stapler was put in the basket (step 5)

B doesn't know about any of these changes. B would think the basket still contains the ball.

Since I'm on B's team and B will be asked what's in the basket, I need to tell B the correct answer: the basket contains a stapler.

Tell(B, basket, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what B needs to know to answer correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room initially and saw C put a ball in the basket.
2. B left the room.
3. After B left: D moved the ball from basket to bag, C put a stapler in the basket, D left, C moved the ball from box to bag (wait, let me re-read)...

Let me re-trace carefully:
1. Everyone in room. C puts ball in basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves ball from basket to bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. C puts stapler in basket. (B doesn't see this)
5. D leaves the room. (B knows D left)
6. C moves ball from bag to box. (B doesn't see this)
7. I (A) move ball from box to bag. (B doesn't see this)

Current state of containers:
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty
- Basket: stapler

B's last knowledge of the basket: ball was in the basket (from step 1). B doesn't know about any changes after leaving.

So B would likely answer "ball" for the basket, but the correct answer is "stapler."

I need to tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**Me (A):** I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything:
- D put an orange in the bag
- B left the room
- C left the room
- D moved the orange from the bag to the box
- D put a stapler in the bag
- So currently: bag = stapler, box = orange, basket = empty

**B:** B saw D put an orange in the bag, then B left. B didn't see D move the orange to the box or put the stapler in the bag. So B thinks the bag still contains the orange.

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the bag. The correct answer is **stapler**.

B currently believes the bag contains an orange (which is wrong). If I don't tell B, B will answer "orange" and our team gets 0 points.

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer gives us 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

- **B:** B saw D put a ball in the box, then B left the room. B doesn't know about C moving the ball to the bag or C putting an apple in the box. So B thinks the box still contains a ball.

2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. C moves the ball from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)

So the current state:

- Basket: ball
- Bag: empty

B last saw: a ball put in the box, then left. B would think the box still contains the ball.

Since I'm going to be asked what B answers about the box, and B doesn't know the box now contains an apple (B thinks it has a ball), I should tell B the correct contents of the box.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

The question is: "What is in the basket?"

Let me trace through what happened:
1. B puts a stapler in the basket.
2. C leaves the room.
3. B puts a ball in the box.
4. I move the ball from the box to the bag.
5. B moves the ball from the bag to the box.
6. I move the ball from the box to the bag.

So currently:
- Basket: stapler (unchanged since step 1)
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty

B was in the room the entire time and saw everything. B knows the basket contains the stapler. B will answer correctly.

Since B knows the correct answer (stapler is in the basket), there's no need for me to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

You, B, and C are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a banana in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the banana from the basket to the bag. ... B enters the room. ... C puts a stapler in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. A, B, C are in the room. B puts banana in basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C moves banana from basket to bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. B enters the room.
5. C puts stapler in basket. (B sees this)
6. C leaves the room.

**What B knows:**
- B put banana in basket (saw this)
- B left the room
- B re-entered the room
- B saw C put stapler in basket
- B does NOT know that C moved the banana from basket to bag while B was out

So B knows the stapler is in the basket (B saw C put it there). B would correctly answer "stapler" for the basket.

Wait, let me reconsider. B saw C put a stapler in the basket. So B knows the basket contains a stapler. That's correct - the basket does contain a stapler.

So B will answer correctly without any help from me. The answer is "stapler" and B knows this.

I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the bag.

Let me trace through B's perspective:

1. B is in the room: sees me put a stapler in the bag.
2. B leaves the room.
3. (B doesn't see C move the stapler from bag to basket)
4. B enters the room.
5. B sees D move the stapler from the basket to the bag.
6. C leaves the room.
7. D leaves the room.
8. (B is still in the room) B sees me move the stapler from the bag to the box.
9. B puts a brick in the bag.

So B was present for steps 8 and 9. B saw me move the stapler from the bag to the box, and then B put a brick in the bag.

Therefore, B knows the bag contains a **brick** (since B put it there).

The question is: "What is in the bag?" and B will be asked.

B knows the answer is a brick. B should answer correctly without any help from me.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the bag.

Let me trace B's knowledge:
1. B puts a ball in the bag (B knows: bag has ball)
2. B leaves the room (B is unaware of what happens next)
3. D moves the ball from the bag to the box (B doesn't see this)
4. B enters the room (B doesn't know what changed while away)
5. D moves the ball from the box to the bag (B sees this happen)

When B re-enters the room and then sees D move the ball from the box to the bag, B witnesses that action. So B now knows the ball is in the bag.

Wait - does B know what was in the box before D moved it? When B re-enters, B sees D move the ball from the box to the bag. So B directly observes the ball going into the bag.

So B knows the bag contains the ball. The correct answer is "ball." B should be able to answer this correctly without my help.

Let me trace through the events from B's perspective:

1. B starts in the room with everyone.
2. D leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room. (B is now outside)

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B leaves the room. ... D puts a stapler in the basket. ... You put a brick in the bag. ... D moves the brick from the bag to the box. ... C moves the brick from the box to the bag. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and tell B, since B will be asked about it.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room. Bag, box, and basket are all empty.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D puts a stapler in the basket.
4. I (A) put a brick in the bag.
5. D moves the brick from the bag to the box.
6. C moves the brick from the box to the bag.
7. I (A) leave the room.

So at the point I left the room, the state was:
- Basket: stapler
- Bag: brick
- Box: empty

B left before any objects were placed, so B has no knowledge of what's in any container. I need to tell B what's in the basket.

After I left, something might have happened, but I wouldn't know about it. However, I need to go with what I last observed. The basket had a stapler when I left.

Since I'll be telling B, and it costs 0.5 points but a correct answer gives 1 point, it's worth it.

Tell(B, basket, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and tell B, since B will be asked about it.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room. B leaves the room.
2. D puts a stapler in the basket.
3. C puts a banana in the bag.
4. I move the banana from the bag to the box.
5. C moves the banana from the box to the bag.
6. D moves the banana from the bag to the box.
7. I leave the room.

At the point I left the room, the basket contained the stapler (it was placed there in step 2 and never moved). The bag was empty, and the box had the banana.

However, after I left the room, something could have happened that I'm not aware of. But the scenario doesn't mention any further events after I leave, so I should assume the basket still contains the stapler.

B was outside the room for all the container movements, so B has no idea what's in any container. I need to tell B what's in the basket.

But wait - after I left the room, C and D (Red team) are still in the room. They could potentially move things around. However, the scenario doesn't describe any events after I leave (the "..." at the end could mean time passed but nothing is described to me since I'm outside). Since I can't see what happens after I leave, I should go with my last known information: the basket has the stapler.

I should tell B the answer.

Tell(B, basket, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the basket and whether I need to help.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room. All containers are empty.
2. B leaves the room. (B is now outside)
3. D puts a banana in the basket. (B is outside, so B doesn't see this. I see it, C sees it, D sees it.)
4. I leave the room. (I'm now outside)
5. C leaves the room. (C is now outside; only D is inside)
6. C enters the room. (C and D are inside)
7. B enters the room. (B, C, and D are inside)
8. B leaves the room. (B is outside again)

Now, the key question: What happened between steps 6-8? When B entered the room (step 7), B could observe anything that happens while B is in the room. But the scenario doesn't mention any objects being moved during steps 6-8. So the banana is still in the basket from step 3, but B never saw it being placed there.

When B entered the room (step 7), B can see who's in the room but **cannot see inside containers** (the rules state "Players cannot see inside containers"). So B wouldn't know the banana is in the basket.

B was outside when the banana was placed in the basket, and nothing happened while B was in the room that would reveal the basket's contents. So B likely doesn't know what's in the basket.

I need to tell B that the basket contains a banana so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

Tell(B, basket, banana)
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- I put a ball in the bag.
- B, C, and D all saw me put the ball in the bag (they were all in the room).
- Then B left, then C left.
- D is still in the room with me.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag.

**What C knows:** C saw me put the ball in the bag. After C left, nothing else happened to the bag (as far as the scenario describes). So C knows the ball is in the bag.

**Key consideration:** C is on the Red team. C will be asked what's in the bag. If C answers correctly ("ball"), the Red team gets 1 point. If C answers incorrectly, the Red team gets 0 points.

**Can I do anything to make C answer incorrectly?** 

I could Tell C false information, like telling C that I moved the ball out of the bag after C left. Since C left the room, C wouldn't know what happened after that. C might believe me and give a wrong answer.

But wait - why would C trust me? I'm on the opposing team. C should be suspicious of anything I tell them. However, C has no way to verify what happened after they left the room. If I tell C something plausible, C faces uncertainty about whether to trust me or not.

Let me try to deceive C. I'll tell C that the bag is now empty (or contains something else), implying I moved the ball after C left. Since C can't verify this, it might cause C to give a wrong answer.

Actually, the most convincing deception: after C left, I could claim I moved the ball to a different container. C knows I'm an opponent, but C also knows that D (C's teammate) is still in the room. C might Ask D to verify. But that would cost the Red team 0.5 points.

The best play is to try to deceive C. Even if C doesn't believe me, it costs me only 0.5 points to try, and if it works, I prevent Red from scoring 1 point (a net swing of 0.5 in my favor).

Tell(C, bag, basketball)
C answers: basketball
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Action: Looking at this situation, I need to figure out what C knows and whether C will answer correctly.

Let me trace through what C observed:
1. C was in the room when I put a ball in the bag. ✓ C knows bag = ball
2. B leaves the room (C still inside)
3. C leaves the room - after this, C is unaware of what happens inside
4. After C left: I put an orange in the box, D moved orange from box to basket, I moved orange from basket to box

So C knows the ball was put in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. C should correctly answer "ball" for the bag.

Since C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the bag, and C knows the correct answer (ball), C will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for the Red team.

I cannot communicate with C (telling C wrong information would be a Tell action, but C has no reason to trust me since I'm on the opposing team). Let me consider my options:

- **Tell(C, bag, something wrong)**: I could try to mislead C by telling them something different is in the bag. But C was in the room when I put the ball in the bag, so C knows the truth. C would likely ignore my misinformation. This would cost 0.5 points and probably not help.
- **Pass**: Costs nothing. C will likely answer correctly.

Since C directly witnessed me putting the ball in the bag, any attempt to mislead C would be futile and would just cost my team 0.5 points.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the right answer is.

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty
- Basket: apple

**What C knows:**
C was in the room when I put the ball in the bag. Then B left, then C left. C didn't see anything after that. So C knows:
- Bag: ball (C saw me put it there)
- Box: empty (as far as C knows)
- Basket: empty (as far as C knows)

**The question:** I will be asked what C says about the bag. C should know the bag contains a ball, since C was present when I put the ball in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag before C left.

So C will likely answer "ball" for the bag, which is correct. That would give the Red team 1 point.

Since C likely already knows the correct answer (ball in the bag), there's nothing I can do to help my team here. I could try to Tell C wrong information to mislead them, but C saw me put the ball in the bag themselves, so they'd likely trust their own observation over my tell.

Let me reconsider: Could I try to deceive C? I could tell C that I moved the ball out of the bag after C left. But C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. Still, it's worth trying since it costs only 0.5 points but could prevent Red from gaining 1 point (net gain of 0.5 for my team).

Tell(C, bag, apple)

This might confuse C into thinking the ball was moved out and replaced with the apple, since C doesn't know what happened after leaving. If C believes me, they'd answer "apple" (wrong), and Red gets 0 points while I only spent 0.5. If C doesn't believe me, Red gets 1 point and I lose 0.5.

It's a gamble, but the expected value could be positive if there's a reasonable chance C believes me.

C answers: apple

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. I put a brick in the bag (everyone sees this - A, B, C, D all in room)
2. B leaves the room
3. C leaves the room
4. D moves brick from bag to box (only A and D see this)
5. D puts apple in bag (only A and D see this)
6. D moves apple from bag to basket (only A and D see this)
7. D moves brick from box to bag (only A and D see this)

**Current state:** Bag = brick, Box = empty, Basket = apple

**What C knows:** C saw the brick go into the bag, then left. C doesn't know about any moves after that. C's last knowledge is that the bag contains a brick.

**The question:** I'm asking C what's in the bag.

C last saw the brick placed in the bag. C doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So C would likely answer "brick" based on their last knowledge.

The actual contents of the bag IS a brick (D moved it back to the bag in the final step).

So C is likely to answer "brick" - which is actually correct! That would give the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C something false to mislead them. But wait - C is on the Red team. If I tell C false information, C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. However, C might also consider that the bag contents could have changed after they left.

Let me think about whether to try to mislead C. If I Tell C that the bag contains something else (like "apple"), C might think: "A is on the opposing team, so A might be lying to make me answer wrong. But A might also be telling the truth." This could confuse C, but C might just stick with "brick" anyway, or C might second-guess themselves.

The risk: Telling costs 0.5 points, and C (being on the opposing team) will likely distrust me. C's natural answer of "brick" is correct, so I want to change that.

If I tell C the bag contains "apple," C might think I'm lying (since I'm the opponent) and stick with "brick" (correct answer). Or C might think I'm telling the truth and switch to "apple" (wrong answer). It's a gamble.

Given that it costs 0.5 points and C may well distrust me, the expected value is uncertain. But if C answers "brick" correctly, Red gets 1 point. If I can trick C into answering wrong, Red gets 0 and I only lose 0.5.

I'll try to mislead C:

Tell(C, bag, apple)
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would be optimal here.

**What I know:**
- C put a stapler in the bag
- B left the room
- D moved the stapler from the bag to the box
- C put a ball in the bag
- D left the room

So currently: bag has a ball, box has the stapler.

**What D knows:**
- D saw C put a stapler in the bag
- D moved the stapler from the bag to the box
- D did NOT see C put a ball in the bag (D left before or after... let me recheck)

Wait, let me re-read the sequence:
1. C puts stapler in bag (all present: A, B, C, D)
2. B leaves the room
3. D moves stapler from bag to box (A, C, D present)
4. C puts ball in bag (A, C, D present)
5. D leaves the room (A, C present)

So D WAS present when C put the ball in the bag. D knows the bag contains a ball.

**The question is for D: "What is in the bag?"**

D knows the answer is a ball. D is on the Red team, so if D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

Since D knows the correct answer (ball), D will likely answer correctly. There's nothing I can do to prevent that - I could try to Tell D wrong information, but D was present and saw the ball go in the bag, so D would know I'm lying.

Let me consider: Could I tell D something misleading? D saw the ball go into the bag and then left. D doesn't know if anything changed after D left. But from D's perspective, the last thing D saw was the ball being put in the bag, and then D left. D has no reason to think anything changed.

However, if I Tell D something different, D might doubt their own knowledge... but D was literally there when the ball was placed. It's unlikely D would trust my misinformation over their own direct observation, especially since I'm on the opposing team.

The best action is to Pass, since spending 0.5 points to try to mislead D (who directly observed the ball being placed) is unlikely to work and would cost my team points.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts a stapler in the bag.
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves the stapler from the bag to the box.
5. C puts a ball in the bag.
6. D leaves the room.
7. I move the stapler from the box to the basket.
8. C moves the stapler from the basket to the box.
9. I move the stapler from the box to the basket.

Current state: **bag has a ball**, basket has a stapler, box is empty.

Now, what does D know? D was present for steps 1-6, then left. At the time D left:
- Bag had a ball (C put it there in step 5)
- Box had a stapler (D moved it there in step 4)
- Basket was empty

D doesn't know about steps 7-9 (stapler moving around between box and basket). So D believes:
- Bag: ball
- Box: stapler
- Basket: empty

The question is: **What is in the bag?** asked to D.

D should answer "ball" based on what D knows, and the actual answer is also "ball." So D would naturally answer correctly!

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider whether I can mislead D. But D is on the opposing team, so if I Tell D something false, it costs me 0.5 points but might cause D to answer incorrectly.

If I tell D the bag contains something else, D might be suspicious since I'm on the opposing team. However, D might also think I'm trying to help for some strategic reason, or D might just ignore me.

The risk: If I Pass, D answers "ball" correctly and Red gets 1 point (Red=1, Blue=0). If I Tell D false info (costing 0.5), and D believes me, Red gets 0 and Blue=-0.5. If D doesn't believe me, Red gets 1 and Blue=-0.5.

D has good reason to trust their own memory here - they saw the ball go into the bag and nothing happened to the bag before they left. Trying to deceive D is risky and likely won't work since D directly witnessed the ball being placed in the bag.

The expected value of telling D false info is poor since D will likely trust their own direct observation.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a stapler in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the bag to the box. ... C puts a ball in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the stapler from the box to the basket. ... C moves the stapler from the basket to the box. ... You move the stapler from the box to the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts a stapler in the bag.
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves the stapler from the bag to the box.
5. C puts a ball in the bag.
6. D leaves the room.
7. I move the stapler from the box to the basket.
8. C moves the stapler from the basket to the box.
9. I move the stapler from the box to the basket.

Current state: **bag has a ball**, basket has a stapler, box is empty.

Now, what does D know? D was present for steps 1-6, then left. At the time D left:
- Bag had a ball (C put it there in step 5)
- Box had a stapler (D moved it there in step 4)
- Basket was empty

D doesn't know about steps 7-9 (stapler moving around between box and basket). So D believes:
- Bag: ball
- Box: stapler
- Basket: empty

The question is: **What is in the bag?** asked to D.

D should answer "ball" based on what D knows, and the actual answer is also "ball." So D would answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

I want to prevent this. I could Tell D false information about the bag to mislead D. But that costs 0.5 points. If D believes me and answers wrong, Red gets 0 points and Blue loses 0.5. If D doesn't believe me, Red gets 1 point and Blue loses 0.5.

However, I'm on the Blue team - why would D (Red team) trust me? D would likely ignore my misinformation since I'm an opponent. This would cost us 0.5 points for likely no benefit.

Alternatively, I could Pass and accept that D will likely get it right (costing us nothing directly, Red gets 1 point).

The risk of Telling D false info is: if D ignores it (likely, since I'm an adversary), we lose 0.5 AND Red gets 1 point. If D believes it, we lose 0.5 but Red gets 0.

Since D has strong reason to distrust me (opposing team), the expected value of telling is probably worse than passing.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Here's what you see:

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts an orange in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the orange from the box to the bag. ... C puts a ball in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. ... C moves the ball from the box to the bag. ... C moves the ball from the bag to the box. ...

I am going to ask D what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what D knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what D saw:

1. Everyone starts in the room. C puts an orange in the box. (D sees this)
2. B leaves the room. (D sees this)
3. D moves the orange from the box to the bag. (D knows this - D did it)
4. C puts a ball in the box. (D sees this)
5. D leaves the room. (D sees this - but after this point, D doesn't see anything)
6. After D leaves: C moves the orange from the bag to the basket.
7. C moves the ball from the box to the bag.
8. C moves the ball from the bag to the box.

So from D's perspective, when D left the room:
- Bag: orange
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

D doesn't know about the movements that happened after D left. So D would think the box contains the **ball**.

The actual current state is:
- Bag: empty
- Box: ball (C moved ball to bag, then back to box)
- Basket: orange

So D's belief is that the box contains a ball, and the actual contents of the box IS a ball.

D will be asked what's in the box. D thinks it's a ball, and it actually is a ball. So D will likely answer correctly, earning Red 1 point.

I'm on the Blue team, so I want D to answer incorrectly. I could Tell D false information to mislead D. Since D knows I was in the room the whole time, D might trust me (or might not, since I'm on the opposing team).

But wait - D knows I'm on the Blue team (the opposing team). D would be suspicious of any information I provide since it's not in my interest to help D. So telling D false info probably won't work because D would likely ignore it or even do the opposite.

If I tell D the truth (box contains ball), D already believes that, so it doesn't change anything. If I tell D something false, D being rational would likely distrust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Actually, if I tell D something false, D might think: "A is my opponent, so A is probably lying. If A says the box contains X, then it probably doesn't contain X." This could actually backfire - if I say "the box contains an orange," D might think I'm lying and stick with "ball" (which is correct).

Alternatively, if I tell D the truth ("box contains ball"), D might think I'm lying and change their answer to something wrong! That could work in my favor.

Let me try telling D the truth - that the box contains a ball. D, being suspicious of an opponent, might second-guess this and answer incorrectly.

Tell(D, box, ball)
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0

Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and C are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask C what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the basket while B, C, and I were all in the room.
- C was present when B put the apple in the basket, so C saw this happen.
- C then left the room.
- Nothing else happened after C left.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the basket.

Since C was in the room when B put the apple in the basket, and nothing changed after that, C knows the apple is in the basket. C should answer "apple" correctly, which would give the Red team 1 point.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - costs nothing, but C will likely answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.
2. **Tell(C, basket, [something wrong])** - I could try to deceive C by telling them something different is in the basket. But C *saw* the apple being placed in the basket. C would likely not believe my lie since they have direct knowledge. This would cost 0.5 points and probably not work.
3. **Ask** - doesn't help here.

Since C directly witnessed the apple being placed in the basket, any attempt to deceive C would likely fail. C has firsthand knowledge and would have no reason to trust a lie from an opposing team member over their own observation.

The best move is to not waste points on a deception that won't work.

Pass
C answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when B put an apple in the basket.
2. C left the room.
3. After C left: B put a brick in the box, I moved the brick from box to bag, B moved the brick from bag to box.

So C knows the apple was put in the basket, but C doesn't know about anything that happened after they left. Since nothing happened to the basket after the apple was placed in it, the apple is still in the basket.

C knows the apple is in the basket. C will likely answer "apple" which is correct, giving the Red team 1 point.

Should I try to mislead C? I could Tell C something false about the basket. But C saw the apple go into the basket with their own eyes, so they'd likely trust their own observation over anything I tell them. Since I'm on the opposing team, C has even more reason to distrust me.

There's no benefit to spending 0.5 points on a Tell action that C will likely ignore, or an Ask action that doesn't help here.

Pass
C answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what C saw:
- C was in the room when B put an apple in the basket.
- C then left the room.
- After C left: B put a stapler in the box, I moved the stapler from box to bag, B moved it from bag to box, I moved it from box to bag.

C doesn't know about any of the stapler movements since they left before those happened. But C **does** know that B put an apple in the basket, since C was in the room when that happened.

So C knows the basket contains an apple, and C will likely answer "apple" which is correct (nothing was moved out of the basket).

The question is: should I spend 0.5 points to try to mislead C?

If I Tell C something false about the basket, C might or might not believe me. I'm on the Blue team (with B), and C is on the Red team. C knows I'm an opponent, so C would likely be suspicious of any information I provide. C saw the apple go into the basket with their own eyes, so telling C something different would likely not change their answer.

Since C directly witnessed the apple being placed in the basket and has no reason to doubt that knowledge, any attempt to mislead would likely waste 0.5 points without changing C's answer.

The best action is to Pass.

Pass
C answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be best for my team.

Let me trace through what C saw and knows:

1. C was in the room when B put a ball in the basket.
2. C left the room.
3. After C left: B moved the ball from basket to bag, I put a stapler in the basket, B moved the stapler from basket to box, I moved the ball from bag to basket.

So C's last knowledge of the basket is that it contains a **ball** (from step 1). C doesn't know about any of the moves that happened after they left.

The current actual state of the basket is: **ball** (I moved it back there).

So C will likely answer "ball" for the basket, which is actually correct! That would give the Red team 1 point.

Let me think about what I can do. I can:
- **Tell C false information** to mislead them about the basket's contents, costing 0.5 points but potentially preventing Red from getting 1 point.
- **Pass** and let C answer (they'll likely say "ball" and get it right, giving Red 1 point).

If I Tell C something false about the basket, C might believe me or might not. Since I'm on the Blue team (opposing team to C), C might be suspicious of my information. However, C might also think I'm trying to help for some strategic reason.

If I tell C the basket contains something wrong (like "stapler" or "empty"), C might:
- Distrust me (since I'm on the opposing team) and stick with "ball" → Red gets 1 point, I lose 0.5
- Believe me and answer wrong → Red gets 0 points, I lose 0.5

The risk is that C, knowing I'm on the opposing team, would likely distrust me. But there's a chance they might second-guess themselves since things could have moved after they left.

Let me try to mislead C. I'll tell them the basket contains the stapler, which is plausible since C knows a stapler could have been introduced.

Tell(C, basket, stapler)
C answers: stapler
Incorrect. The basket actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

1. **D was in the room** when I put the stapler in the box.
2. **D left the room** before B moved the stapler from the box to the bag, and before I put the brick in the box.
3. So **D thinks the box contains the stapler** (which is wrong - the box now contains a brick).

Since D is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the box, D will likely answer "stapler" based on what they last saw. The correct answer is "brick," so D would get it wrong, meaning Red doesn't score.

If I Pass, D will likely answer "stapler" (incorrect) and Red gets 0 points. That's good for us.

If I Tell D the truth (brick), it costs us 0.5 points and helps Red score 1 point - terrible for us.

The best action is to Pass, since D has outdated information and will likely answer incorrectly.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: empty
- Box: brick
- Basket: stapler

**What D knows:**
D was in the room when I put the stapler in the box. Then D left the room. After D left:
- B moved the stapler from box to bag
- I put a brick in the box
- B left the room
- I moved the stapler from bag to basket
- C moved the stapler from basket to bag
- I moved the stapler from bag to basket

D didn't see any of these changes. So D last saw the stapler go into the box, and nothing else happened to the box while D was watching.

**D will likely answer "stapler"** for the box, which is **wrong**. The correct answer is **brick**.

Since D is on the Red team, this is good for us - D will likely get it wrong without any intervention. I should Pass to avoid spending points.

Wait, but I need to consider whether C might tell D the correct answer. C was in the room and saw the stapler move from basket to bag, and then I moved it back to basket. C also saw me put the brick in the box (C was present the whole time). So C knows the box contains a brick.

C and D are teammates, so C might use a Tell action to inform D. But it's currently MY turn, not C's turn. The action phase has turns, and it's my turn now. After me, other players may get turns before the answer phase.

Actually, I should consider whether I can mislead D. But D is on the opposing team, and if D is going to answer wrong anyway, I don't want to accidentally help. Let me think about whether C will get a turn to tell D the truth.

If C gets a turn, C could Tell(D, Box, Brick) and D would answer correctly, costing Red 0.5 but gaining 1 point (net +0.5 for Red).

I could try to preemptively Tell D wrong information to confuse things, but that costs 0.5 points. If D already thinks it's a stapler, telling D something wrong doesn't help much - and C could still correct D.

Actually, if I Tell D something like "the box has a stapler," it reinforces D's wrong belief, but costs us 0.5 points. If C then tells D the truth, D has conflicting info.

The best play is probably to **Pass** - D likely already has the wrong answer, and spending points to reinforce that isn't worth it since C can still correct D.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would help my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when I put the stapler in the box.
- D then left the room.
- After D left: B moved the stapler from box to bag, I put a brick in the box, B left, I moved stapler from bag to basket, C moved stapler from basket to bag.
- D doesn't know about any of these changes after leaving.
- So D thinks the stapler is still in the box.

**The actual state:**
- Box: brick
- Bag: stapler
- Basket: empty

**D will be asked what's in the box.** D likely thinks it's the stapler, but the correct answer is the brick.

D is on the Red team. If D answers "stapler" (which is what D believes), that's wrong - Red gets no point. That's good for us.

If I Tell D the correct answer (brick), that would cost us 0.5 points and help the Red team score 1 point, netting -1.5 for us. Bad idea.

If I Tell D a wrong answer, it costs 0.5 points but D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

The best play here is to **Pass**. D will likely answer "stapler" based on their last knowledge, which is incorrect. Red scores 0 points, and we lose 0 points.

- After D left: C moved banana from bag to basket, B moved banana from basket to bag, B moved banana from bag to box, I put a brick in the bag, B left the room.
- D doesn't know about any of these moves after leaving.

So D thinks the banana is still in the bag. But the bag actually contains a brick.

**The question is: What is in the bag?** (asked to D)
The correct answer is: **brick**.

D will likely answer "banana" since that's what D last saw. That would be incorrect, scoring 0 for Red.

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly on their own, I don't need to help them. I should Pass to avoid spending points.

But wait - could C help D? Let me check if C knows the current state. C was in the room the whole time, so C knows the brick is in the bag. C is on D's team and could Tell D the correct answer during C's turn.

However, it's currently MY turn. If I Pass, then other players may get turns before the answer phase. But I need to consider whether I should try to mislead D.

Actually, if I Tell D false information, it costs 0.5 points. D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. And if C later tells D the truth, my 0.5 points would be wasted.

The safest play is to Pass. D likely answers "banana" (wrong), and we don't spend any points.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- D put an orange in the basket, then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the orange from the basket to the bag, and put a brick in the basket.
- So the basket currently contains a brick.

**What D knows:**
- D saw themselves put an orange in the basket, then left.
- D doesn't know about C's actions after D left.
- D likely believes the basket still contains the orange.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket. D is on the Red team.

**What C knows:**
- C knows the basket contains a brick (C did the moving).
- C and D are teammates. C could Tell D the correct answer.

**Strategy considerations:**
- If I Pass, C might tell D the correct answer on C's turn (costing Red 0.5 but gaining 1 point = net +0.5 for Red).
- If D answers without help, D will likely say "orange" (wrong), scoring 0 for Red.
- I could Tell D wrong information to try to confuse things, but D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.
- I could try to Tell D "orange" to reinforce D's wrong belief, making D more confident in the wrong answer even if C later tries to correct them. But this costs me 0.5 points.

The key question is whether C will get a turn before D answers. The action phase seems to give turns to players, and C might use their turn to Tell D the truth.

Actually, let me think about this differently. If I Pass (0 cost), and then C tells D the truth (0.5 cost to Red), D answers correctly (1 point to Red), net for Red = +0.5. Net for Blue = 0.

If I Tell D wrong info (0.5 cost to Blue), D might be confused even if C tells the truth. But D would likely trust teammate C over opponent A.

The best play is to **Pass** - it costs nothing, and D will likely answer "orange" (wrong) unless C spends 0.5 to correct them. Even if C corrects D, Red only nets +0.5.

Pass
D answers: orange
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. D puts an orange in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. After D leaves: C moves orange from basket to bag, puts brick in basket, moves orange from bag to box, I move orange from box to bag, C moves orange from bag to box.

So the current state is:
- Bag: empty
- Box: orange
- Basket: brick

Now, D will be asked what's in the basket. D saw the orange placed in the basket, then left the room. D doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So D will likely answer "orange" for the basket.

D's answer of "orange" would be **wrong** (the basket actually contains a brick). That's good for my Blue team - Red gets 0 points.

Now, should I use Tell to help D get the right answer? No! D is on the Red team. I want D to answer incorrectly.

Should I Tell D wrong information to further confuse them? That's unnecessary since D already likely believes the basket has an orange, which is wrong. Spending 0.5 points to tell D something would cost my team points.

Could C (D's teammate) use their turn to Tell D the correct answer? Yes, C saw everything and knows the basket has a brick. C might tell D the truth on C's turn. But that's C's decision, not mine.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from telling D the truth on C's turn. Spending points now wouldn't help.

The best action is to Pass and hope D answers incorrectly.

Pass
D answers: orange
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. D puts an orange in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.
5. C puts a brick in the basket.
6. I move the orange from the bag to the box.
7. C moves the orange from the box to the bag.

Current state: basket has a brick, bag has an orange, box is empty.

Now, what does D know? D was in the room when the orange was put in the basket. D left the room after B. After D left, C moved the orange to the bag, put a brick in the basket, I moved the orange to the box, and C moved it back to the bag. D doesn't know about any of these changes.

So D thinks the basket still has the orange.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to D.

D is on the Red team. The correct answer is "a brick." D will likely answer "orange" because that's the last thing D saw in the basket.

D answering incorrectly means Red doesn't get a point - that's good for us.

Now, should I Tell D the correct answer? No! That would help the Red team score a point and cost us 0.5 points.

Should I Tell D wrong information? That would cost 0.5 points but D already likely thinks it's the orange, so misleading D further doesn't help.

Could I try to trick D? If I tell D something wrong, it costs 0.5 points. D already has wrong information, so there's no benefit.

The best action is to Pass. D will likely answer "orange" (wrong), Red gets 0 points, and we lose nothing.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what the optimal action is.

**What I know:**
- D put a stapler in the basket, then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the stapler around and eventually put it in the box, then put a brick in the basket.
- So the basket currently contains a **brick**.

**What D knows:**
- D saw the stapler go into the basket, then left the room.
- D doesn't know about C's movements after D left.
- D would believe the basket still contains the **stapler**.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket. The correct answer is **brick**.

D doesn't know the correct answer. D is on the Red team, so if D answers wrong, that's good for us (Red doesn't get the point). If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

**Should I Tell D the truth?** No! D is on the opposing team. If I tell D the correct contents, Red scores a point. 

**Should I Tell D a lie?** D already thinks the basket has a stapler (which is wrong). If I tell D something else, it might confuse D, but D might also just ignore me or become suspicious. D might already be inclined to answer "stapler" which is wrong - that's good for us.

**Should I tell D a lie to reinforce the wrong answer?** That would cost 0.5 points. But D is already likely to answer "stapler" (wrong), so spending 0.5 points to reinforce a wrong answer D is already going to give is wasteful.

**Could D figure out the truth?** C is D's teammate. But C can't communicate with D during my action phase - it's my turn. However, C might get a turn later before the answer phase... Actually, the answer phase comes after this action phase. So C won't have a chance to tell D.

Wait - the structure says each turn has a scenario, action phase, and answer phase. So after my action, D answers. C doesn't get a turn to tell D.

Since D will likely answer "stapler" (which is wrong), the best move is to **Pass** and save the 0.5 points.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what C saw before leaving:
- C was in the room when B put a stapler in the basket
- Then C left the room
- After C left: I moved the stapler from basket to bag, put a banana in the basket, and various moves happened with the stapler

So C's last knowledge is that the **stapler** is in the basket. C doesn't know about the banana being placed there or any subsequent moves.

The question is: What is in the basket? The actual answer is **banana** (the basket currently contains a banana).

C will likely answer "stapler" based on their last observation, which is wrong. That means Red gets 0 points from this question.

Since C is going to get this wrong anyway (they think the stapler is in the basket, but it's actually the banana), there's no need for me to spend points on any action. I should just Pass.

2. C then left the room.
3. After C left: I moved the stapler from basket to bag, put a banana in the basket, moved the stapler from bag to box, and B moved the stapler from box to bag.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to C.

Currently, the basket contains a **banana**.

C will likely answer "stapler" (which is wrong), since that's the last thing C saw in the basket.

This is good for the Blue team - C answering incorrectly means Red doesn't get a point. But I should consider whether I want to use a Tell action to mislead or help.

Wait - C is on the Red team. If C answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points. If C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. So I want C to answer incorrectly.

C currently thinks the basket has a stapler, which is wrong (it has a banana). So C is already likely to give the wrong answer.

If I Tell C anything, I'd be spending 0.5 points from my team. I could try to mislead C, but C already has the wrong information. Or I could accidentally help C if I'm not careful.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what I should do.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**C's perspective:**
- C was in the room when B put an orange in the basket.
- C then left the room.
- After C left: I moved the orange from basket to box, B moved it from box to basket, D left, I moved orange from basket to bag, I put banana in basket.
- C doesn't know about any of these moves after leaving.
- C knows D left the room (since players outside know who enters/leaves).
- So C thinks the orange is still in the basket.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the basket.

**Current reality:** The basket contains a banana.

**C's likely answer:** C will say "orange" (since that's what was in the basket when C left).

This would be **incorrect** - the basket actually contains a banana. So C answering incorrectly means the Red team gets 0 points. That's good for us!

Now, should I Tell C the correct answer? No! That would cost us 0.5 points AND help the Red team score 1 point.

Should I Tell C wrong information? That costs 0.5 points but C already has wrong information, so it's wasteful.

Should I Pass? Yes - C will answer incorrectly on their own, costing Red 0 points and costing us nothing.

Wait - but could D tell C the correct answer? D left the room before I moved the orange to the bag and put the banana in the basket. D thinks the orange is in the basket too. So D can't help C either.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. **All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.** D puts an apple in the bag.
2. **B leaves the room.** (B knows apple is in bag, but misses everything after)
3. **D moves the apple from the bag to the box.** (A, C, D see this)
4. **C puts an orange in the bag.** (A, C, D see this)
5. **A (me) leaves the room.**

So the current state (as of when I left):
- **Bag**: orange
- **Box**: apple
- **Basket**: empty

I don't know if anything happened after I left, but the question is being asked to D.

**D knows everything** that happened while in the room (D never left). D knows the bag contains an orange (unless something changed after I left, which I wouldn't know about).

The question is: **I am going to ask D what is in the bag.**

D is on the Red team. D will want to answer correctly to earn 1 point for Red. D knows the bag contains an orange (assuming nothing changed after I left). D will likely answer "orange" and score a point for Red.

Can I do anything to prevent this? 

- I could **Tell D false information**, but D was in the room the whole time and knows the truth - D won't be misled.
- I could **Ask** someone something, but that costs 0.5 points and doesn't help prevent D from answering correctly.
- **Passing** costs nothing.

Since D was in the room the entire time and knows exactly what's in the bag, there's nothing I can do to change D's answer. Any action I take would just cost my team 0.5 points without any benefit.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether I need to take any action.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room. Bag, box, basket are empty.
2. D puts an apple in the bag. → Bag: apple
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves the apple from the bag to the box. → Bag: empty, Box: apple
5. C puts an orange in the bag. → Bag: orange
6. C moves the apple from the box to the basket. → Box: empty, Basket: apple
7. I move the apple from the basket to the box. → Basket: empty, Box: apple
8. D moves the apple from the box to the basket. → Box: empty, Basket: apple
9. I leave the room.

Final state (as of when I left): Bag: orange, Box: empty, Basket: apple

Now, the question will be asked to D: "What is in the bag?"

D was in the room the entire time and saw everything. D knows the bag contains an orange. D is on the Red team, so D will answer correctly and score 1 point for Red.

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D has perfect knowledge of the bag's contents. Any Tell action to D would cost us 0.5 points and D wouldn't be fooled since D saw everything. Asking someone would also cost 0.5 points unnecessarily.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to figure out what D knows about the bag, and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room. All containers empty.
2. D puts apple in bag. → Bag: apple, Box: empty, Basket: empty
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves apple from bag to box. → Bag: empty, Box: apple, Basket: empty
5. C puts orange in bag. → Bag: orange, Box: apple, Basket: empty
6. D moves apple from box to basket. → Bag: orange, Box: empty, Basket: apple
7. C moves apple from basket to box. → Bag: orange, Box: apple, Basket: empty
8. D moves apple from box to basket. → Bag: orange, Box: empty, Basket: apple
9. I move apple from basket to box. → Bag: orange, Box: apple, Basket: empty
10. C moves apple from box to basket. → Bag: orange, Box: empty, Basket: apple
11. D moves apple from basket to box. → Bag: orange, Box: apple, Basket: empty
12. I leave the room.

At the time I left, the state was: Bag: orange, Box: apple, Basket: empty.

D was present for everything. D knows the bag contains an orange. Since D is on the Red team, D will answer correctly that the bag contains an orange, giving the Red team 1 point.

Now, should I take an action? 

- I could Tell D false information, but D was in the room the whole time and saw everything, so D would know I'm lying and ignore it.
- I could Ask or Tell B, but that doesn't help since D is being asked the question.
- Any Ask or Tell costs 0.5 points.

D knows the truth and won't be fooled by any Tell action from me. There's no benefit to spending points here.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what D believes is in the bag.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) in room. D puts stapler in bag.
2. D leaves room. (D doesn't see what happens next)
3. C moves stapler from bag to basket. (A, B, C see this)
4. D enters room. (D is back)
5. C moves stapler from basket to bag. (Everyone sees this - D sees stapler go back to bag)
6. B leaves room. (B doesn't see what happens next)
7. D moves stapler from bag to box. (A, C, D see this)
8. C puts orange in bag. (A, C, D see this)
9. A (me) leaves room. (I don't see what happens next)
10. B enters room. (B is in room now)
11. B leaves room.

So at the point I left (step 9), the state was:
- Bag: orange
- Box: stapler
- Basket: empty

After I left, B entered and then left. I don't know if anything changed while I was out, but C was still in the room. However, D was also in the room.

D was present for steps 7 and 8, so D knows:
- D moved the stapler from bag to box (step 7)
- C put orange in bag (step 8)

After step 8, D was in the room. Then I left (step 9), B entered (step 10), B left (step 11). D was in the room the whole time during steps 9-11, so D would have seen anything that happened.

D knows what's in the bag. D saw the orange being put in the bag. Unless something changed after I left, D knows the bag contains the orange.

Since D is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the bag, D likely knows the correct answer (orange) - unless something changed after I left that I'm unaware of.

I don't need to take any action here since D is on the opposing team and I can't benefit from helping or hindering in this situation. The question is being asked to D, not to my team. D was present and aware of the orange being placed in the bag, so D likely knows the answer.

I should Pass since any action would cost my team points and I can't prevent D from answering correctly.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. D puts a brick in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
4. I (A) move the brick from the bag to the box. (Everyone sees this.)
5. B moves the brick from the box to the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
6. I (A) leave the room.

After I leave, I don't know what happens. But at the point I left:
- Basket: stapler
- Box: empty
- Bag: brick

C was in the room the entire time and saw everything. C knows the basket contains the stapler.

Now, the question is whether anything happened after I left that might have changed the basket's contents. I don't know what happened after I left. But C does know - C is still in the room.

Since C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the basket, C knows the answer (the stapler, unless something changed after I left). C will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from knowing what's in the basket - C has been in the room the whole time and has perfect information. Any Tell action to C would cost us 0.5 points and C would just ignore misinformation since C has direct knowledge.

The best action is to Pass, since spending points won't change C's knowledge.

C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether C knows it.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room.
2. B puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. D puts an apple in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)

5. B moves the apple from the box to the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
6. D moves the apple from the bag to the box. (Everyone sees this.)
7. I leave the room.

At this point, the basket contains the stapler, the box contains the apple, and the bag is empty.

After I leave, I don't know what happens. But C was in the room the entire time and saw everything. C knows the basket has the stapler.

The question is: will C answer correctly? C is on the Red team, and answering correctly gives the Red team 1 point. So C will definitely try to answer correctly.

C knows the basket has the stapler (C saw B put it there, and nothing was moved out of the basket during the scenario). So C will answer "stapler" and Red gets 1 point.

There's nothing I can do to prevent this - I can't trick C because C was present for everything. A Tell action to C with false information would cost us 0.5 points and C would know it's false since C saw everything. An Ask action would just cost us 0.5 points for information I already know.

Action: I need to figure out what C knows about the basket and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through what C has seen:

1. **Everyone in room**: B puts a brick in the basket. (C sees this)
2. **C leaves the room**: C doesn't see what happens next.
3. **While C is outside**: D moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (C doesn't see this)
4. **C enters the room**: C is now back in the room.
5. **C is in room**: I move the brick from the bag to the basket. (C sees this)
6. **I leave the room**: I'm now outside.

So what does C know? C saw B put the brick in the basket initially. Then C left and missed D moving the brick to the bag. When C returned, C saw me move the brick from the bag to the basket. 

So C knows the brick is in the basket. C will likely answer correctly.

Since C is on the Red team and will be asked about the basket, and C knows the correct answer (brick in the basket), the Red team will get 1 point if C answers correctly.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell C misleading information, but C directly saw me move the brick to the basket, so C has no reason to believe a lie over their own observation.

There's no benefit to spending 0.5 points on an action here since C witnessed the brick being placed in the basket and won't be misled. Any Tell or Ask would just cost my team points without changing the outcome.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to think carefully about what I know about the basket.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I, B, C, and D are in the room. I put a banana in the basket.
2. I leave the room. (While I'm outside, I can't see what happens inside, but I know who enters/leaves.)
3. I enter the room.
4. C moves the banana from the **bag** to the basket.
5. D leaves the room.

Wait - in step 4, C moves the banana from the **bag** to the basket. But I originally put the banana in the **basket**. This means that while I was outside the room (between steps 2 and 3), someone must have moved the banana from the basket to the bag. I wasn't aware of that move since I was outside.

Now, C moves the banana from the bag to the basket. So after step 4, the banana is in the basket.

But I need to consider: could anything else have happened? After step 4, D leaves the room, but I'm still in the room, so I would see anything else that happens. The scenario ends with the banana in the basket.

So the basket contains the banana. I'm confident about this.

Pass

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: Let me trace through what I know:

1. Everyone starts in the room. B leaves.
2. C leaves.
3. I put an orange in the bag.
4. I leave the room.
5. I enter the room. (At this point, I can see the current state - but actually I can't see inside containers. However, I'm aware of anything that happens while I'm in the room.)
6. D moves the orange from the bag to the box. (I see this.)
7. D moves the orange from the box to the bag. (I see this.) So the orange is back in the bag.
8. I leave the room.
9. B enters the room.
10. B leaves the room.

After step 7, the orange is in the bag. Then I leave. Between my leaving (step 8) and B entering (step 9), D is alone in the room. D could have moved things. Then B enters - B would see anything D does while B is in the room. Then B leaves.

So between step 8 and step 10, D was in the room and could have moved the orange. I don't know what D did while I was outside.

However, B was in the room from step 9-10, so B would have seen anything D did during that time. But D was alone between steps 8 and 9, so neither B nor I know what happened then.

Wait - D was in the room the entire time from the start. After I left (step 8), D could have moved the orange before B entered (step 9). Then when B entered, B would see any further actions but not what happened before B arrived.

So I'm uncertain about what's in the bag. D knows for sure. B might know partially (only what happened while B was in the room from step 9-10).

Since I'll be asked the question, I need to figure out what's in the bag. D knows the answer but D is on the Red team and might lie. B was in the room with D but only from step 9 onward - B wouldn't know what D did between steps 8 and 9 either.

Actually, let me reconsider: B can't see inside containers, so even entering the room doesn't reveal container contents. B would only know if D moved something while B was present.

Let me ask B what happened - if D moved anything while B was there, B would know.

Ask(B, bag)
A answers: nothing
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events:

1. C puts a stapler in the bag. (I see this)
2. I leave the room. (I can't see what happens inside)
3. I enter the room. (I can see again)
4. D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. (I see this)
5. B moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (I see this)
6. I leave the room. (I can't see what happens inside)
7. B leaves the room. (B is now outside too)

So when I left the room the second time (step 6), the stapler was in the bag. After that, B left the room (step 7). Between my leaving and B leaving, B was still in the room and could have moved things. But the scenario doesn't describe B moving anything during that time - though I wouldn't know since I was outside.

Wait - I need to be careful. Since I was outside the room after step 6, I wouldn't be told about any object movements that happened. So something could have happened between steps 6 and 7 that I'm not aware of.

However, B was in the room during that period and would know. After B left, C and D could still be in the room (the scenario doesn't say they left), so they could have moved things after B left too.

Let me check who's in the room: C and D never left, so they're still inside. They could have moved the stapler after both B and I left.

The safest action is to ask B what's in the bag, since B was in the room until step 7 and would know the state at that point. But B wouldn't know about changes after B left either.

Actually, C and D are opponents - they might lie. B is my teammate and would tell the truth. B would know the state of the bag up until B left the room. After B left, only C and D remain, and they could have changed things.

Since B's information is the most reliable I can get (teammate, won't lie), let me ask B.

Ask(B, bag)
A answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C leaves the room. ... You put a brick in the bag. ... C enters the room. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. ... D moves the orange from the basket to the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... B enters the room. ... You leave the room. ... D leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room. Bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. C leaves the room.
3. I put a brick in the bag. (Bag: brick)
4. C enters the room.
5. I leave the room. (I can no longer see what happens inside)
6. I enter the room. (I can see again)
7. C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. 

Wait - this says C moves "the orange" from the bag. But I put a brick in the bag. Something must have happened while I was outside the room (between steps 5 and 6). Someone must have swapped the brick for an orange, or put an orange in the bag. But the scenario only describes what I can see - when I was outside, things could have happened that I wasn't aware of.

Actually, let me re-read: "when a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room." So when I re-enter at step 6, I can see what happens from that point forward. The scenario describes what I observe.

At step 7, C moves "the orange" from the bag to the basket. This means when C did this action (which I witnessed), the orange was in the bag. So while I was out (between steps 5 and 6), someone must have replaced the brick with an orange in the bag.

8. D moves the orange from the basket to the bag. (Bag: orange)
9. B leaves the room.
10. B enters the room.
11. I leave the room. (I can't see what happens now)
12. D leaves the room.

Between steps 11 and 12, things could have happened in the room that I didn't see. After I left, B was still in the room (B entered at step 10). D was also in the room until step 12. So B and D were in the room together after I left, and things could have changed.

When I last saw, the bag had the orange (after step 8). But after I left (step 11), B and/or D could have moved things before D left at step 12.

B was in the room the entire time after step 10, so B knows what happened. Let me ask B.

Ask(B, bag)
A answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through what I observed:

1. **I'm in the room**: D puts a banana in the basket. → Basket: banana
2. **I leave the room**: I can't see what happens inside, but I know who enters/leaves.
3. **I enter the room**: I can now see what happens again.
4. **I'm in the room**: D moves the banana from the basket to the bag. → Basket: empty, Bag: banana
5. **I'm in the room**: B moves the banana from the bag to the basket. → Bag: empty, Basket: banana
6. **I leave the room**: I can't see what happens after this.

The question is: what happened after I left the room the second time? I don't know if anything changed. Between my first departure and my return, something could have happened too, but since I saw the state when I came back (steps 4 and 5 happened while I was present), that's accounted for.

After I left the second time, things might have changed. My teammates B is someone I can ask. B was in the room the entire time (the scenario never mentions B leaving), so B would know the current state of the basket.

Since I'm not sure if anything happened after I left, I should ask B what's in the basket.

The cost is 0.5 points, and a correct answer gives 1 point, so the expected value is positive if this helps me answer correctly.

Ask(B, basket)
A answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened and what each player knows:

1. A (me), B, C, D are all in the room. C puts an orange in the bag.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C leaves the room.
4. I put a brick in the basket.
5. D moves the brick from the basket to the box.
6. I move the brick from the box to the basket.

Current state:
- Bag: orange
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

What does B know?
- B saw C put an orange in the bag (B was in the room).
- B left the room, so B doesn't know about anything after that.
- B knows the bag has an orange (as far as B knows, nothing changed in the bag after B left).

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B.

B saw the orange go into the bag, and after B left, nothing happened to the bag (the brick movements involved the basket and box only). So B should correctly know the bag contains an orange.

B will likely answer "orange" which is correct, earning Blue 1 point.

Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend 0.5 points to Tell B. I should Pass.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:**
- Bag: orange (C put it there, and nothing moved it)
- Box: banana (D moved it there last)
- Basket: empty

**What B knows:**
- B was in the room when C put the orange in the bag
- B left the room before anything else happened
- So B knows: Bag = orange, and that's the last thing B saw before leaving
- B doesn't know about the banana being put in the basket or any subsequent moves

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the bag.

B should know the answer! B saw C put the orange in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag before or after B left. So B knows the bag contains an orange.

Since B already knows the correct answer (orange is in the bag), I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B. I should Pass.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what's actually in the bag.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts an apple in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
4. C moves the apple from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)
5. D puts a ball in the bag. (B doesn't see this)
6. C moves the ball from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
7. D moves the apple from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
8. C leaves the room. (B knows C left)

**Actual state of the bag: apple** (D moved it back to the bag in step 7)

**What B thinks is in the bag:** B last saw C put an apple in the bag (step 2), then B left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B would think the bag contains the **apple**.

B's belief actually matches reality - the bag does contain the apple. So B would likely answer "apple" which is correct, earning us 1 point.

However, I should consider whether B might second-guess themselves or if there's any risk. Since B saw the apple placed in the bag and has no information about changes, B should answer "apple."

Since B's natural answer (apple) is correct, I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B anything. I'll pass.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

After B left:
- I moved the ball from the bag to the box
- D moved the ball from the box to the bag

None of these actions involved the basket. The basket still contains the banana.

So B will be asked what's in the basket. B last saw a banana being placed in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that. B should know the answer is "banana."

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

The question is: "What is in the basket?"

Let me trace through what B knows:
1. B was in the room initially. B put a ball in the basket.
2. C leaves the room (B sees this).
3. B moves the ball from the basket to the bag.
4. B puts a banana in the basket.
5. B leaves the room.

After B leaves:
- D moves the ball from the bag to the box.
- I move the ball from the box to the bag.
- D moves the ball from the bag to the box.

So the current state is:
- Basket: banana
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty

From B's perspective, when B left the room:
- Basket: banana
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty

B doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So B would think the basket contains a **banana**, which is actually correct since nobody moved the banana.

B should answer "banana" and get it right. Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

7. D moves the apple from the bag to the box. (A, D see this; B doesn't)
8. D moves the banana from the basket to the bag. (A, D see this; B doesn't)
9. D moves the banana from the bag to the basket. (A, D see this; B doesn't)

Current actual state:
- Box: apple
- Bag: empty
- Basket: banana

What B knows:
- B left after step 5. At that point:
  - Bag: apple
  - Basket: banana
  - Box: empty
- B doesn't know about any moves after leaving.

So B would think the basket contains a **banana**, which is actually correct! The banana is indeed in the basket right now.

Since B's belief (banana in basket) matches reality (banana in basket), B should answer correctly without my help. I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B needs help answering about the basket.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room when I put an orange in the basket. ✓ B knows the basket has an orange.
2. B left the room.
3. After B left: I put a stapler in the box, D moved the stapler from box to bag, I moved the stapler from bag to box. B didn't see any of this.

The basket still has the orange in it (nothing was moved out of the basket). B saw me put the orange in the basket. So B knows the basket contains an orange.

Since B already knows the correct answer (orange in the basket), there's no need to spend 0.5 points telling B.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. A (me), B, and D are in the room.
2. I put an orange in the basket. (B and D both see this)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)

6. I move the stapler from the box to the bag. (Only I and D see this)
7. D moves the stapler from the bag to the box. (Only I and D see this)

The question is: What is in the basket?

B saw me put an orange in the basket. After B left, nothing happened to the basket - the orange is still there. So B should know the answer: the basket contains an orange.

Since B was present when I put the orange in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after B left, B should correctly answer "orange" without any help from me.

I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

B answers: orange

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A (me), B, and D are in the room. All containers are empty.
2. I put a brick in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (B's last knowledge: brick is in the basket.)
4. D moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this.)
5. D puts an orange in the basket. (B doesn't see this.)
6. D moves the orange from the basket to the box. (B doesn't see this.)
7. D moves the brick from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this.)

So the current state is:
- Basket: brick
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty

B's last knowledge before leaving was that the brick was in the basket. B will be asked what's in the basket.

B would likely answer "brick" based on their last knowledge, which happens to be correct! The brick is currently in the basket.

So B's natural answer of "brick" is actually correct. I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a ball in the basket, then left the room.
- After B left, C moved the ball from the basket to the bag, and put a brick in the basket.
- B doesn't know about C's actions since B was outside the room.
- So B thinks the ball is still in the basket, but actually the basket contains a brick.

**What will happen:**
- I will be asked... wait, no. B will be asked what is in the basket.
- B thinks the basket contains the ball (since B left before C moved things).
- The basket actually contains a brick.
- If B answers "ball," that's wrong, and Blue gets 0 points.

**My optimal action:**
I should tell B what's actually in the basket so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Tell(B, basket, brick)
B answers: brick

**What B knows:**
- B put a ball in the basket
- B left the room
- B knows C, D, and I were still in the room after B left
- B doesn't know about any moves after leaving
- B would think the basket still has the ball (unless told otherwise)

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the basket.
- B would likely answer "ball" (which is wrong - the basket has a brick)
- The correct answer is "brick"

Since B is my teammate, I want B to answer correctly to earn 1 point for our team. I should tell B what's in the basket.

The cost of a Tell action is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points. If I pass, B will likely say "ball" and get 0 points. So telling is better.

**What D knows:** D moved the apple from the basket to the box. Then D saw C move the apple from the box to the basket, then from the basket to the bag, then C put a brick in the basket. D knows the basket has a brick.

Let me analyze the situation:

**What I know (as player A, who stayed in the room the whole time):**
- D put a brick in the box initially
- B and C left the room
- After they left, D moved the brick from the box to the bag
- D then put a stapler in the box

- Bag: brick
- Box: stapler
- Basket: empty

**What B knows:**
- B saw D put a brick in the box (B was in the room for that)
- B left the room before D moved anything
- So B believes the box still contains the brick

**The question will be asked to B: "What is in the box?"**
- B will likely answer "brick" (which is wrong - the box now contains a stapler)
- If B answers incorrectly, Blue team gets 0 points for that answer

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an apple in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the apple from the box to the basket. ... C moves the apple from the basket to the box. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the apple from the box to the bag. ... D puts a stapler in the box. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the box.

Action: I need to figure out what's optimal here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**My knowledge (Player A):** I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything:
- D put apple in box
- D moved apple from box to basket
- C moved apple from basket to box
- D moved apple from box to bag
- D put stapler in box
- **Box currently contains: stapler**
- **Bag currently contains: apple**
- **Basket currently contains: empty**

**B's knowledge:** B was in the room initially, saw D put apple in box, then left. After leaving, B saw no container changes. B knows:
- B saw: D put apple in box
- B left, then saw C leave later
- B would think the box still contains the apple (unless told otherwise)
- **B thinks box = apple**

**The question is asking B what's in the box.** The correct answer is **stapler**. B thinks it's **apple**, which is wrong.

I should tell B what's actually in the box so B can answer correctly and we get 1 point. This costs 0.5 points, but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

If I Pass, B will likely answer "apple" (wrong) and we get 0 points.

Tell(B, box, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

- **Me (A):** I saw everything. The box currently contains an **apple**. The bag contains an **orange**. The basket is empty.
- **B:** B saw C put an orange in the box, then B left the room. B doesn't know about D moving the orange to the bag or D putting an apple in the box. So B thinks the box still contains an **orange** (which is wrong).
- **C and D:** They saw everything and know the box contains an apple.

The question will be asked to **B** about the box. B currently believes the box contains an orange, but it actually contains an **apple**. If B answers "orange," we lose the point.

I should tell B what's actually in the box so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains us 1 point if B answers correctly, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

Tell(B, box, apple)
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened and what each player knows:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. C puts an orange in the box.
2. B leaves the room. (B knows: orange is in the box at this point)
3. After B leaves: D moves orange from box to bag, puts apple in box, moves orange from bag to basket, I move orange from basket to bag, D moves orange from bag to basket.

**Current state:**
- Box: apple
- Basket: orange
- Bag: empty

**What B knows:** B last saw the orange placed in the box, then left. B doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So B would think the box contains the orange.

**The question is: What is in the box?** (asked to B)
The correct answer is: **apple**

B doesn't know this - B would guess "orange" which is wrong. I need to tell B what's in the box.

Tell(B, box, apple)
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and whether B knows it.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts an orange in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
4. D moves the orange from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
5. D puts an apple in the box. (B doesn't see this)
6. I move the orange from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
7. D moves the orange from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)

So the current state is:
- Box: apple
- Bag: orange
- Basket: empty

B last saw the orange being put in the box (step 2), then left. B doesn't know about any changes after that. B would think the box still contains the orange.

The correct answer is that the box contains an **apple**. B will likely answer "orange" which is wrong.

I should tell B what's in the box so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Tell(B, box, apple)

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts a stapler in the box.
3. B leaves the room.
4. After B leaves: D moves stapler from box to basket.
5. C moves stapler from basket to box.
6. D moves stapler from box to bag.
7. D puts an apple in the box.

So the current state is:
- Bag: stapler
- Box: apple
- Basket: empty

B saw the stapler go into the box, then left. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. So B thinks the box still contains the stapler.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the box?" The correct answer is **apple**.

B will likely answer "stapler" (which is wrong) unless I tell B the correct contents.

Since B is my teammate, I should tell B what's in the box so our team gets 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer gives us 1 point, netting +0.5 points.

If I pass, B will likely say "stapler" and get 0 points.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room.
2. C puts a ball in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room. (D no longer sees what happens)
4. B puts a stapler in the box. (A, B, C see this)
5. I (A) move the stapler from the box to the bag. (A, B, C see this)
6. C moves the stapler from the bag to the box. (A, B, C see this)

Current state of containers:
- Basket: ball
- Box: stapler
- Bag: empty

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the basket?"

B was in the room the entire time and saw C put the ball in the basket. Nothing else was moved into or out of the basket. So B knows the basket contains the ball.

B should answer "ball" correctly without any help from me. There's no need to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Let me trace through the scenario:
1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. Everyone sees everything.
2. C puts a ball in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room. (B, A, C still in room)

6. A moves the banana from the box to the bag. (B and C see this)

So the current state is:

B was in the room the entire time and saw everything. B knows the basket contains a ball.

Since B knows the correct answer (ball in the basket), there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the basket.

Let me trace through B's perspective:

1. B is in the room: C puts an apple in the basket. **B sees this.**
2. B leaves the room.
3. C moves the apple from the basket to the bag. **B doesn't see this.**
4. B enters the room.
5. D moves the apple from the bag to the basket. **B sees this.**
6. D leaves the room.

So B saw D move the apple from the bag to the basket. B knows the apple is in the basket.

The current state: the apple is in the basket. B knows this.

Since B already knows the correct answer (apple is in the basket), I don't need to spend points telling B. I should Pass.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the basket.

Let me trace through what happened from B's perspective (B was in the room the entire time):

1. I put an orange in the basket - B saw this
2. I put an apple in the bag - B saw this
3. B moved the apple from the bag to the box - B did this
4. I moved the apple from the box to the bag - B saw this
5. C moved the apple from the bag to the box - B saw this

So B knows the orange is in the basket. B was present for all events and saw me put the orange in the basket. Nothing was ever moved out of the basket.

Since B already knows the correct answer (orange is in the basket), I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can answer correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room when I put an apple in the basket. B knows: basket has apple.
2. B leaves the room. B doesn't see what happens next.
3. C moves the apple from the basket to the bag. B doesn't know this.
4. B enters the room. B doesn't see the current state of containers.
5. D puts a ball in the basket. B sees this happen.

So B knows:
- Apple was in the basket (from step 1)
- D put a ball in the basket (from step 5)

B might think the basket has a ball (since D put a ball in the basket, and B saw that). But B might also wonder about the apple - B last knew the apple was in the basket, and then D put a ball in the basket. Since each container holds at most one object, B might be confused. But wait - B didn't see the apple get moved out. So B might think D's action replaced the apple, or B might be confused about what happened.

Actually, the key question: the basket currently contains a **ball** (D put a ball in the basket, and the apple had already been moved to the bag by C).

B saw D put a ball in the basket. So B likely knows the basket contains a ball. But B might be uncertain because B thought the apple was still there and containers can only hold one object.

Actually, B saw D put a ball in the basket. The basket now has a ball. B should know this - B witnessed it directly. Even if B is confused about what happened to the apple, B directly observed D putting a ball in the basket, so B should answer "ball."

B likely knows the correct answer (ball), so I should Pass to save points.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the bag and whether I need to take any action.

Let me trace through the events from B's perspective:

1. B starts in the room with me, C, and D.
2. B leaves the room.
3. (B is outside) D leaves the room - B knows D left.
4. (B is outside) I put a stapler in the bag - B doesn't see this.
5. B enters the room - B is now back in the room.
6. D enters the room.
7. D puts an orange in the basket - B sees this.
8. D leaves the room - B sees this.
9. D enters the room - B sees this.
10. I leave the room - B sees this.

So B was outside the room when I put the stapler in the bag. B doesn't know what's in the bag. When B re-entered the room, nothing was said about the bag contents (players can't see inside containers).

Since I'm being asked about what B will answer regarding the bag, and B doesn't know the bag contains a stapler, I should tell B what's in the bag so B can answer correctly.

Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B needs help.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. **I put an apple in the box.** (Only I and C are in the room at this point, so only C and I see this.)

6. D enters the room.
7. I leave the room.
8. D leaves the room.
9. C leaves the room.
10. C enters the room.

So B was outside the room when I put the apple in the box. B doesn't know what's in the box. When B re-entered the room, nothing else happened to the box while B was present (no one moved anything after B came back, at least not while B was in the room).

Wait, let me check: after B enters (step 5), the events are: D enters, I leave, D leaves, C leaves, C enters. No objects were moved during any of these steps. So B never saw anything being placed in or removed from the box.

B doesn't know the box contains an apple. I need to tell B.

Action: The scenario is straightforward. I was in the room when I put a ball in the box. B was also in the room at that time, so B saw me put the ball in the box. After that, I left the room, then B left the room.

However, after I left, something could have happened before B left - C and D were still in the room and could have moved the ball. But B was still in the room and would have seen any changes. So B knows the current state of the box when B left.

The key question is: did anything happen between when I left and when B left? From my perspective (outside the room), I only know that B left the room after me. I don't know if C or D moved anything. But B would know, since B was still inside.

Since B was in the room the entire time and witnessed everything, B knows what's in the box. B has no reason to lie to me (we're teammates), and B will be asked the question directly.

If nothing changed, B knows the ball is in the box. If C or D moved the ball, B saw that too and knows the current contents.

Since B has perfect knowledge of the box's contents, there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling or asking anything. B can answer correctly on their own.

Pass
B answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: The question will be asked to B about the contents of the box.

Let me think about what B knows. B was in the room when I put a ball in the box. B was also in the room when D put a brick in the basket. Then I left, then B left. 

After B left, we don't know if anything else happened in the room (C and D might still be in the room and could have moved things). But from B's perspective, B saw me put the ball in the box, and nothing else happened to the box before B left.

However, after B left, C and/or D could have moved objects around. But B wouldn't know about that.

Since B was present when I put the ball in the box, and B didn't see anyone remove it before leaving, B should know the box contains a ball. B can answer correctly on their own.

But wait - did anything happen after I left but before B left? The scenario shows: "You leave the room. ... B leaves the room." The ellipsis suggests time passed. During that time, C and/or D could have done something in the room while B was still there. But the scenario doesn't describe anything happening, which means from my perspective (I was outside), I wouldn't see what happened inside. However, B was still inside and would have seen anything.

From B's perspective, B saw the ball go in the box, and if nothing else happened to the box before B left, B knows it's still a ball. Since the scenario doesn't mention anything else happening to the box (and B would have witnessed it if it did), B should correctly answer "ball."

There's no need to spend points on a Tell action since B already has this information.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: The question will be asked to B about the contents of the box.

Let me think about what B knows. B was in the room when I put a ball in the box. B was also in the room when C put an apple in the basket. Then I left the room, and then B left the room.

After B left the room, we don't know if anything else happened (C and D were still in the room and could have moved objects). But from B's perspective, the last thing B saw was: ball in the box, apple in the basket.

However, since B left after me, B would have seen everything that happened up until B left. The scenario as described to me shows that after I left, B left - but between my leaving and B leaving, something could have happened that B saw but I didn't. But based on the scenario description, nothing happened between my leaving and B's leaving.

So B should know that the box contains a ball (as of when B left the room). B doesn't know if C or D moved anything after B left.

Since B was present when I put the ball in the box, B should be able to answer correctly that the box contains a ball - assuming C and D didn't move it after B left. But we have no indication that anything changed after B left.

Wait - actually, the scenario only shows what I observed. After I left the room, I wouldn't see what happens inside. C and D could have moved things. But B was still in the room briefly after I left, and B would know what happened during that time.

Since I don't know if anything changed after I left (and before B left), B might have more information than me. But the scenario as written doesn't indicate any changes happened after I left.

B should know the box contains a ball. No action needed from me.

Pass
B answers: ball

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag now and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. I put a banana in the bag. Everyone sees this.
2. I (A) leave the room. B, C, D remain.
3. B leaves the room. C, D remain.
4. C leaves the room. D remains alone.
5. C enters the room. C and D are in the room.
6. B enters the room. B, C, D are in the room.
7. B leaves the room. C, D remain.

During steps 3-4, after I left, B and then C left, leaving D alone. D could have moved things. Then C came back (step 5), and C or D could have moved things. Then B entered (step 6) and could observe the state at that point, but B wouldn't know what happened during steps 3-4 when B was outside.

The key question: what's in the bag NOW, and does B know?

From my perspective (I left at step 2), I don't know what happened after I left. D was alone and could have rearranged things. Then C and D were together and could have changed things. Then B entered and saw whatever state existed at that point, but B doesn't know the full history either.

However, B was in the room during step 6, so B saw the current state of the room at that point. But B can't see inside containers - players cannot see inside containers! So B entering the room doesn't tell B what's in the bag.

B knows:
- Originally a banana was in the bag (B saw me put it there)
- B left the room (step 3), and D was still inside
- D could have moved things while B was away
- B re-entered (step 6) but can't see inside containers
- B left again (step 7)

So B doesn't know for certain what's in the bag now. B only knows what was originally there, but D (and later C) could have changed things.

I also don't know what's in the bag. The banana might still be there or might have been moved.

Since I don't know the actual contents and B doesn't know either, I should tell B what I last knew - that the banana was in the bag. This might help if nothing changed, but it costs 0.5 points.

Actually, B already knows I put a banana in the bag - B was present for that. So telling B adds no new information. I should Pass.

Pass
B answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the bag (I saw this, as did C and D since we were all in the room).
- D left the room first, then B left.
- After both left, nothing else happened to the bag.

**What D knows:**
- D was in the room when B put the apple in the bag, so D knows the bag contains an apple.
- D left before B, but nothing happened to the bag after D left (or after B left).

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

Since D was present when B put the apple in the bag, and nothing changed after that, D knows the bag contains an apple. D is on the Red team and will answer correctly, earning 1 point for Red.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?** 
- I could Tell D false information, like Tell(D, bag, "orange"), but D saw the apple being placed in the bag with their own eyes. D has no reason to trust my false information over what they directly witnessed. D would likely ignore my lie and answer "apple" correctly.
- Asking or telling costs 0.5 points, which would hurt my team.

Since D directly witnessed the apple being placed in the bag and nothing changed afterward, any attempt to mislead D would be futile and would just cost my team 0.5 points.

D answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... B leaves the room. ... You put a ball in the box. ... C moves the ball from the box to the basket. ... You move the ball from the basket to the box. ...

Action: I need to think about what each player knows.

**What happened:**
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts an apple in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
3. D leaves the room. (D no longer sees what happens inside.)
4. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens inside.)
5. I put a ball in the box. (Only A and C see this.)
6. C moves the ball from the box to the basket. (Only A and C see this.)
7. I move the ball from the basket to the box. (Only A and C see this.)

**Current state:**
- Bag: apple
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

**What D knows:**
- D saw B put an apple in the bag.
- D then left the room. D knows B and D both left, but doesn't know what happened inside after leaving.
- D's last knowledge: bag has apple, box and basket are empty.
- D doesn't know about any changes to the bag after leaving.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

D is on the Red team. D should know the bag contains an apple, since D saw B put it there, and nothing happened to the bag after D left. So D should correctly answer "apple" and Red gets 1 point.

Since D already knows the correct answer (apple is in the bag), there's nothing I can do to help my team here. I could try to Tell D wrong information to mislead them, but D saw the apple being placed in the bag themselves and nothing happened to the bag after that - D would likely trust their own memory over my deception.

However, it's worth trying to mislead D. If I tell D something different about the bag, D might second-guess themselves. Let me try telling D the bag contains something else - maybe that the ball is in the bag (implying someone moved things around after D left).

Tell(D, bag, ball)
D answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what D saw:
- D was in the room initially and saw B put an apple in the bag.
- D then left the room.
- After D left: B left, C put a banana in the box, I moved the banana to the basket, C moved it back to the box, I moved it back to the basket.

D doesn't know about any of the banana movements, but D **does** know that the apple was put in the bag. Since nothing happened to the bag after that, the apple is still in the bag.

So D will be asked "what is in the bag?" and D knows the answer is "apple" because D saw B put the apple in the bag, and D has no reason to think it was moved (D left the room but would know who entered/left, and nobody told D anything different).

D is on the Red team, so if D answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point. I want to prevent that.

I could try to Tell D false information about the bag to mislead D. For example, I could tell D that the bag contains something else, or is empty. But D saw the apple go into the bag with their own eyes, so D would likely not believe me (since I'm on the opposing team and have incentive to lie).

However, D might reason: "A is telling me the bag contents changed - maybe someone moved the apple after I left." D knows that after they left, B was still in the room briefly, then B left, and C and A were in the room. So it's plausible that someone moved the apple.

Let me try to mislead D. The cost is 0.5 points for my team, but if it causes D to answer incorrectly, the Red team loses 1 point they would have gained.

Tell(D, bag, banana)

This is plausible because D doesn't know about the banana at all, and might think someone moved the apple out and put a banana in. But D might also be suspicious since I'm on the opposing team.

On balance, I think the attempt to mislead is worth it. D saw the apple go in, but might second-guess if I "helpfully" tell them it changed. The 0.5 cost is worth the chance of preventing Red from scoring 1 point.

Tell(D, bag, banana)
D answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.

Action: I need to figure out what's optimal here.

Let me trace through what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) in room. B puts orange in box.
2. D leaves the room. (D knows: orange is in box)
3. C moves orange from box to bag. (D doesn't see this)
4. B puts stapler in box. (D doesn't see this)
5. C moves stapler from box to basket. (D doesn't see this)
6. B moves orange from bag to box. (D doesn't see this)
7. B leaves the room.

Final state: **orange is in the box**, stapler is in the basket, bag is empty.

D's knowledge: D last saw the orange placed in the box, then left. D doesn't know about any changes after that. D saw B leave the room but doesn't know what happened inside.

The question is for D: "What is in the box?"

D will likely answer "orange" based on their last knowledge (which happens to be correct - the orange IS in the box now). So D would get it right, scoring 1 point for Red.

But wait - D might have been told something by C (their teammate) during the action phase. Let me think about what C knows. C was in the room for everything except... C was in the room the whole time. C knows the box contains the orange.

If C tells D the truth, D answers correctly (Red scores). If C lies, D might answer wrong.

Since it's MY turn (Blue team), I want D to answer INCORRECTLY. 

D likely thinks the box has an orange (from their own memory). The actual answer is also orange. So D will probably get it right regardless of what I do.

I could try to Tell D false information to confuse them. If I tell D the box contains something else, D might doubt their memory. But D might also just trust their own memory or trust their teammate C over me.

Let me consider: If I tell D the box contains "stapler" or something else, D might get confused. But D has no strong reason to trust me (opposing team). D's own memory says orange, and C (teammate) would likely confirm orange.

The risk is spending 0.5 points on a Tell that D ignores, netting us -0.5 while Red gets +1.

Alternatively, I could Pass and save the 0.5 points. Red likely scores 1 point either way.

Actually, let me reconsider - there's a chance D is uncertain since they left early and might be susceptible to misinformation. But D's own memory directly says "orange in box" and that's correct. It's unlikely my lie would override D's direct observation.

I'll pass to avoid losing 0.5 points.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room and put a brick in the bag.
2. B left the room - D saw this.
3. D moved the brick from the bag to the box - D knows this.
4. C put a ball in the bag - D saw this.
5. D left the room - after this point, D doesn't know about any changes.

So D knows that when he left, the bag contained a ball (put there by C) and the box contained a brick (moved there by D). Since nothing else happened after D left, D should correctly know that the bag contains a ball.

Since D is on the Red team, and the question is asking D what's in the bag, D knows the answer is a ball. D will answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell D false information, but D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). D saw C put the ball in the bag with his own eyes, so he'd have no reason to believe me if I told him something different.

There's nothing I can gain by spending 0.5 points here. Any Tell to D would likely be ignored since D directly witnessed what happened. Any Ask would cost points without helping since I already know everything.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the question will be.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" directed at D.

Let me trace what D saw:
1. D was in the room initially. D put a brick in the bag.
2. B leaves the room (D sees this).
3. D moves the brick from the bag to the box.
4. C puts a ball in the bag.
5. D leaves the room.

After D leaves:
- I move the brick from the box to the basket.
- C moves the brick from the basket to the box.
- I move the brick from the box to the basket.

So currently: the bag has a ball, the basket has a brick, and the box is empty.

From D's perspective, when D left the room:
- The bag had a ball (C put it there)
- The box had a brick (D moved it there)
- D doesn't know about anything that happened after leaving

So D would likely answer "ball" for the bag, which is actually correct! The ball is still in the bag.

Since D is on the Red team, if D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. That's bad for me.

I can't Tell D wrong information convincingly since D was in the room when C put the ball in the bag. D saw that happen. If I tell D something different about the bag, D would know I'm lying (D saw the ball go in the bag and left before anything else happened to the bag).

Actually, D might be suspicious but D doesn't know what happened after leaving. I could try to Tell D that the bag contains something else, implying the ball was moved. D knows things could have changed after leaving.

Let me try to mislead D by telling D the bag contains something different - making D think the ball was moved out.

Tell(D, bag, brick)

This might make D think the brick was moved to the bag (and the ball was moved elsewhere), causing D to answer "brick" instead of "ball."

The cost is 0.5 points for my team, but if it causes D to answer wrong, Red doesn't get 1 point. Net benefit for us.

Tell(D, bag, brick)
D answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room initially. D puts a brick in the bag.
2. B leaves the room. (D is still in the room)
3. D moves the brick from the bag to the box.
4. C puts a ball in the bag.
5. D leaves the room. — At this point, D knows: brick is in the box, ball is in the bag.

After D leaves:
- C moves the brick from the box to the basket.
- I move the brick from the basket to the box.
- C moves the brick from the box to the basket.

D doesn't see any of this. So D's last knowledge is: brick in box, ball in bag.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to D.

D's belief is that the ball is in the bag. And the actual contents of the bag IS the ball (the ball was put in the bag and was never moved). So D will likely answer "ball" which is correct, giving Red 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell D something false about the bag to mislead D, but that would cost 0.5 points. If D believes me and answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points and Blue loses 0.5 points. But if D doesn't believe me, Red gets 1 point and Blue loses 0.5 points.

The question is whether D would trust information from me (an opponent). Since I'm on the Blue team and D is on the Red team, D should be suspicious of any information I provide. D already believes the ball is in the bag based on their own observation, so they'd likely stick with their own knowledge rather than trust an opponent's claim.

Telling D false information is risky: if D ignores it, we lose 0.5 for nothing. If D believes it, we save 1 point from Red but spend 0.5, netting +0.5 relative advantage.

Given that D has strong firsthand knowledge that the ball is in the bag, and I'm an opponent with clear incentive to lie, D will almost certainly ignore my Tell. So the expected value of telling is negative.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room initially. D put a stapler in the box.
2. B leaves the room. (D still in room)
3. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (D knows: bag=stapler, box=empty)
4. C puts a ball in the box. (D knows: bag=stapler, box=ball)
5. D leaves the room. At this point, D believes: bag=stapler, box=ball, basket=empty.

After D leaves:
6. C moves the stapler from the bag to the basket.
7. C moves the ball from the box to the bag.
8. C moves the ball from the bag to the box.

So the actual current state is: basket=stapler, box=ball, bag=empty.

D thinks the box contains a **ball**, which is actually correct! The ball was put in the box while D was present, and even though C moved things around after D left, the ball ended up back in the box.

So D will likely answer "ball" which is correct, giving the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell D something false to mislead him, but D has no reason to trust me since I'm on the opposing team. D saw the ball go into the box and has no reason to think it moved.

Alternatively, I could tell D false information hoping to confuse him, but a rational player would likely ignore misleading info from an opponent. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell that D would likely ignore would just cost my team points.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the question will be.

C was in the room when they put an apple in the bag. Then C left the room. After C left, B put a banana in the box, I moved the banana from the box to the basket, and D moved the banana from the basket to the box. C doesn't know about any of these movements since they happened after C left.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" directed at C.

C knows they put an apple in the bag. Since C left before anything else happened, and nothing happened to the bag after C left (the banana movements involved the box and basket only), the apple is still in the bag.

So C will correctly answer "apple" for the bag, giving the Red team 1 point.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly here. C has direct knowledge of putting the apple in the bag, and the apple is indeed still there. Even if I tried to Tell C misleading information, C would likely trust their own memory over my claim.

The best move is to not waste points.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- C put an apple in the bag, then left the room.
- After C left: I put a ball in the basket, B moved it to the box, I moved it back to the basket, D moved it to the box.
- Current state: apple in bag, ball in box, basket is empty.

**What C knows:**
- C saw themselves put an apple in the bag, then left.
- C doesn't know about any movements after leaving (ball movements don't affect the bag anyway).
- C knows the bag contains an apple.

**The question:** C will be asked what's in the bag.

C knows the apple is in the bag because C put it there and nothing happened to the bag before C left. C is on the Red team, so C will want to answer correctly to earn a point for Red.

C should answer "apple" correctly, earning Red 1 point. There's nothing I can do to prevent this - I can't Tell C wrong information convincingly enough since C personally put the apple in the bag and would know the truth.

If I Tell C something false about the bag, C has no reason to believe me (I'm on the opposing team), and C already knows what's in the bag from direct experience. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell or Ask would just cost my team points with no benefit.

Pass
C answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a brick in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... B moves the brick from the box to the bag. ... You put an orange in the box. ... B moves the orange from the box to the basket. ... D moves the brick from the bag to the box. ...

I am going to ask C what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. C puts a brick in the box (everyone sees this - A, B, C, D all in room)
2. C leaves the room
3. B moves the brick from the box to the bag (C doesn't see this)
4. I put an orange in the box (C doesn't see this)
5. B moves the orange from the box to the basket (C doesn't see this)
6. D moves the brick from the bag to the box (C doesn't see this)

**Current state:**
- Bag: empty
- Box: brick
- Basket: orange

**What C knows:**
C saw the brick placed in the box, then left. C doesn't know about any subsequent moves. C would believe the brick is still in the box.

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the box. Wait, no - C will be asked what is in the box.

C's best guess would be "brick" (since that's what C last saw in the box before leaving). And actually, the brick IS in the box right now (D moved it back). So C would likely answer "brick" and get it correct, scoring 1 point for the Red team.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C false information to mislead them. If I tell C something different is in the box, C might change their answer.

Let me think: If I tell C that something else is in the box, C might be suspicious since I'm on the opposing team. C knows I have incentive to lie. So C might ignore my misinformation.

However, if I tell C the box contains something other than brick, C has to weigh whether I'm lying or telling the truth. C knows moves happened after they left (since B, D, and I were still in the room). So C might think the brick was moved.

Let me try to mislead C by telling them the box contains the orange (which is plausible since objects were moved around).

Tell(C, box, orange)
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**C's perspective:**
- C was in the room when D put an apple in the basket.
- C then left the room.
- C did NOT see me move the apple from the basket to the bag.
- C did NOT see me put a ball in the basket.
- So C believes the basket still contains the apple.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the basket. The actual answer is **a ball**.

C will likely answer "apple" (based on what C last saw), which is **wrong**. This is good for my team (Blue) since C is on the Red team - their wrong answer means they don't get a point.

Now, should I take an action?

- If I **Tell C the truth** (Tell(C, basket, ball)), C would know the correct answer and Red would get a point. That's bad for Blue, and costs us 0.5 points too.
- If I **Tell C a lie** (Tell(C, basket, something wrong)), C might change their answer to something wrong, but C is already going to answer wrong anyway. This would cost 0.5 points for no benefit.
- If I **Pass**, C will likely answer "apple" which is wrong, and it costs nothing.

The best action is to Pass, since C is already going to give the wrong answer.

Pass
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains ball.

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether I should help C or not.

Let me trace through the scenario from C's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room. The bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. D puts an apple in the basket. (C sees this)
3. C leaves the room. (C no longer sees what happens)

After C leaves:
- I move the apple from the basket to the bag.
- I put a ball in the basket.
- B leaves the room.
- I move the apple from the bag to the box.
- D moves the apple from the box to the bag.
- I move the apple from the bag to the box.

So C's last knowledge is: apple is in the basket, bag and box are empty.

C will likely answer "apple" for the basket, but the actual contents of the basket is a **ball**.

Since C is on the Red team, I want C to answer **incorrectly**. C will probably say "apple" (which is wrong - the basket has a ball). That's good for my team since C getting it wrong means Red doesn't score.

However, C's teammate D was in the room the whole time and saw everything. D knows the basket contains a ball. D could Tell C the correct answer before C's turn.

But right now it's MY turn. I should consider whether to do anything. Since C is likely to answer incorrectly (saying "apple" when it's actually "ball"), and any action I take to "help" C would hurt my team, I should Pass.

If D tells C the truth later, that's a risk, but I can't prevent that. Spending points to mislead C isn't necessary since C is already likely wrong.

Pass
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether I should help C or not.

Let me trace through the scenario from C's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room. C sees D put an apple in the basket.
2. C leaves the room. At this point, C knows: basket has apple, bag is empty, box is empty.
3. After C leaves, I move the apple from basket to bag, put a ball in the basket, B leaves, I move apple from bag to box, D moves apple from box to bag.

C doesn't know about any of these changes. So C thinks the basket still has the apple.

The actual contents of the basket: a ball.

C is on the Red team. If C answers correctly, Red gets a point. If C answers incorrectly, Red gets nothing.

C will likely answer "apple" for the basket (based on what C last saw). The actual answer is "ball." So C would answer incorrectly, which is good for my team.

I should **not** help C since C is on the opposing team. If I tell C the truth, I'd be helping Red score while costing my team 0.5 points. If I tell C a lie, I'd spend 0.5 points but C might already be wrong anyway.

The best action is to Pass - C will likely answer "apple" which is wrong, and I don't spend any points.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether C will answer correctly.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**C's perspective:**
- C was in the room initially and saw D put a stapler in the basket.
- C then left the room.
- After C left: B moved the stapler from basket to box, D moved it from box to basket, I moved it from basket to bag, and I put a ball in the basket.
- C is unaware of all these moves since C was outside the room.
- C knows B left the room after C did, but doesn't know what happened inside.

So C thinks the stapler is still in the basket. But the basket actually contains a ball.

**The question is asking C what's in the basket.** C will likely answer "stapler" (which is wrong). That means Red gets 0 points from this question, which is good for us.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly, I don't need to help C (and wouldn't want to). I also don't need to spend points on any action here.

However, I should consider whether D might Tell C the correct answer. D was in the room and saw B move the stapler to the box, then D moved it back to the basket. But then D was still in the room when I moved the stapler from the basket to the bag and put a ball in the basket. So D knows the basket contains a ball.

D could Tell C the correct contents. But that's D's decision, not mine. There's nothing I can do to prevent that.

The best action for me is to Pass, saving our points and hoping C answers incorrectly.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Incorrect. The basket actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- D put a ball in the bag, then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the ball from the bag to the box, and put a banana in the bag.
- D doesn't know about C's moves (D was outside the room), so D thinks the ball is still in the bag.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

**What D believes:** D thinks the bag contains the ball (since D left before C made changes).

**The actual answer:** The bag contains a banana.

**D is on the Red team.** If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. If D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points.

Since D doesn't know about the switch, D will likely answer "ball" — which is wrong. This is good for my team (Blue).

**Should I act?**
- If I **Pass**: D will likely say "ball" (wrong). Red gets 0 points. Blue loses nothing. This is good for Blue.
- If I **Tell D the truth** (Tell(D, bag, banana)): D would know the correct answer and Red would get 1 point, costing Blue 0.5 points too. Terrible for Blue.
- If I **Tell D a lie** (Tell(D, bag, ball)): This reinforces D's wrong belief, but costs 0.5 points. Unnecessary since D already believes it's the ball.

The best action is to **Pass** — D will answer incorrectly on their own, and it costs me nothing.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would benefit my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when the ball was put in the bag.
- D then left the room and doesn't know about any subsequent moves.
- So D believes: bag = ball

**What actually happened:**
- C moved the ball around and put a banana in the bag.
- Currently: bag = banana, basket = ball

**The question:** I will be asked what D will say is in the bag.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask D what is in the bag."

So D will be asked what's in the bag. D thinks the ball is still in the bag (since D left before any changes). The actual contents of the bag is a banana.

D will likely answer "ball" (what D last saw), but the correct answer is "banana." D answering incorrectly means Red gets 0 points.

Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer incorrectly. D currently believes the bag contains a ball, but it actually contains a banana. So D will naturally get this wrong.

However, could C (D's teammate) tell D the correct answer? Let me check - it's MY turn right now, not C's. So C hasn't had a chance to act yet.

Wait, but the action phase order matters. It says "It is your turn." If I pass, then other players might get turns before D answers. C could Tell D the correct contents.

If I Tell D wrong information, it costs 0.5 points and D might get confused. But D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

The best strategy: I should try to mislead D. If I tell D the bag contains something wrong, D might second-guess. But D might not trust me (Blue team player).

Actually, let me think about whether C will get a turn to tell D the truth. If C gets a turn, C could Tell(D, bag, banana) and D would answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.

I could Tell D something incorrect to create confusion, but it costs 0.5 points and D might just ignore me or trust C instead.

The safest play is to Pass. D will likely answer "ball" (wrong), Red gets 0 points, and I don't spend any points.

Pass
D answers: ball
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team (Blue) score points.

The question will be asked to D: "What is in the bag?"

Let me trace what D knows:
- D was in the room when the brick was put in the bag
- D left the room
- After D left: C moved the brick from bag to basket, B moved it back to bag, B left, C moved brick from bag to box, C put banana in bag
- D doesn't know about any of these moves since D was outside the room

So D thinks the brick is still in the bag. The actual contents of the bag is a **banana**.

D is on the Red team. If D answers correctly, Red gets a point. If D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point.

D will likely answer "brick" since that's what D last saw. The correct answer is "banana." So D will likely get it wrong, which is good for my team.

Now, should I take an action?
- If I Tell D the truth (banana), D gets it right and Red scores 1 point. Bad for me.
- If I Tell D something wrong, D might use that info or ignore it. But D already thinks it's a brick, which is already wrong.
- If I Pass, D will likely answer "brick" (wrong), and Red gets 0 points.

The best move is to Pass - D is already going to answer incorrectly, and any action I take either costs my team points or risks helping the Red team.

D answers: brick

3. So **D** thinks the banana is still in the basket (since D left before any changes were made).

The question will be asked to **D**: "What is in the basket?"

D will likely answer "banana" because that's what D last saw. But the actual contents of the basket is a **stapler**.

So D will answer incorrectly, which means the Red team gets 0 points. This is good for us - we don't need to do anything.

There's no benefit to telling D the truth (that would help the Red team). There's no benefit to asking anyone anything. The best action is to Pass and let D answer incorrectly.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the question will be.

D was in the room when C put the banana in the basket. Then C left, then D left. After D left, several things happened that D is unaware of:
- I moved the banana from the basket to the bag
- B put a stapler in the basket
- B moved the banana from the bag to the box
- I moved the banana from the box to the bag
- B moved the banana from the bag to the box

So D thinks the banana is still in the basket (since D left before any moves happened after C's action).

The actual contents of the basket: a stapler.

D will be asked what's in the basket. D will likely answer "banana" since that's what D last saw. The correct answer is "stapler," so D would be wrong, which is good for my team.

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly (saying "banana" instead of "stapler"), this benefits the Blue team. I should not help D by telling them anything. I should Pass.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would help my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D saw before leaving:**
- C put a banana in the basket
- Then C left the room
- Then D left the room

So D's last knowledge is: banana is in the basket.

**What actually happened after D left:**
- I moved banana from basket to bag
- B put stapler in basket
- I moved banana from bag to box
- B moved banana from box to bag

**Current state:**
- Basket: stapler
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket.

D thinks the banana is in the basket (based on what D last saw). The correct answer is the stapler.

Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer **incorrectly**. If D answers "banana" (which is what D believes), that would be wrong — good for my team!

If I Tell D the truth (stapler is in the basket), D might answer correctly, giving Red a point. If I tell D nothing (Pass), D will likely say "banana," which is wrong — no point for Red.

I could also try to mislead D, but that costs 0.5 points. Since D is already likely to give the wrong answer, the best move is to Pass and save points.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when C put an orange in the basket.
- Then C left, then D left.
- After D left, D doesn't know about any movements that happened in the room.
- So D believes the orange is still in the basket.

**The actual state:**
- Box: orange
- Basket: stapler
- Bag: empty

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket.

D thinks the orange is in the basket, but the actual answer is the stapler. D is on the Red team, so if D answers correctly, Red gets a point. If D answers incorrectly, Red gets nothing.

Since D will likely answer "orange" (which is wrong), that's good for my team - Red won't score.

I don't want to help D get the right answer. There's no benefit to me in using Tell or Ask here. I should just Pass to save points.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what's in the box.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts a banana in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
3. D leaves the room.
4. C moves the banana from the box to the basket. (D doesn't see this - D is outside.)
5. D enters the room.
6. C moves the banana from the basket to the box. (D sees this - D is back in the room.)
7. I (A) leave the room.
8. B leaves the room.

So after step 7 and 8, I don't know what happened in the room after I left. But at the time I left, the banana was in the box (C had just moved it back).

Now, D's perspective: D saw the banana placed in the box initially, left, came back, then saw C move the banana from the basket to the box. So D knows the banana is in the box at that point. After that, A and B left, but D stayed in the room with C. D would know whatever happened after that.

The question is: what happened after I left? I don't know. C and D were still in the room. C could have moved the banana again.

However, D is being asked what's in the box, and D was in the room the entire time after re-entering. So D knows the current state of the box perfectly. D has no information gap about the box.

Since D is on the Red team, D will answer correctly if the banana is still in the box, earning Red a point. If something changed after I left, D would still know.

Since D has perfect information about the box (D stayed in the room), D will answer correctly regardless of what I do. There's nothing I can do to help or hinder this situation - D knows the truth.

I should not spend points on an action that won't benefit my team.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what D knows about the basket.

Let me trace through D's perspective:

1. D is in the room initially. B puts a ball in the basket. **D sees this.**
2. D leaves the room.
3. While D is outside: I move the ball from the basket to the bag. **D doesn't see this.**
4. D enters the room.
5. I put a stapler in the basket. **D sees this.**
6. I leave the room.

So D saw:
- B put a ball in the basket
- Then D left and came back
- Then I put a stapler in the basket

Now, D knows the basket can only hold one object. When D saw me put a stapler in the basket, D would know the stapler is now in the basket. But D might think the ball was still there when the stapler was placed - however, since containers hold at most one object, D would realize the stapler replaced whatever was in the basket.

Actually, let me reconsider. D saw the ball go into the basket, then left. D didn't see the ball get moved. When D returned, D then saw me put a stapler in the basket. Since only one object can be in a container, D would know the stapler is in the basket now (it either replaced the ball or was put in after the ball was removed - either way, the stapler is there).

The correct answer is: the basket contains the **stapler**.

D likely knows this because D saw me put the stapler in the basket. D should answer correctly.

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's anything I can do. I could try to Tell D false information to confuse them, but D directly saw me put the stapler in the basket, so D would likely trust their own observation over anything I tell them.

Any Tell action would cost 0.5 points and D would likely ignore it since they saw the stapler go in. So the best action is to Pass.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

The answer is straightforward. I was in the room when C put the brick in the bag (replacing or adding to the stapler). Since I witnessed C put a brick in the bag most recently, I know the bag contains a brick. No need to spend points asking anyone.

Action: I need to think carefully about what I know.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. There's an empty bag, empty box, and empty basket.
2. I put a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
3. I leave the room. (Now I can't see what happens inside, but I know if anyone enters/leaves.)
4. No one is described as entering or leaving, so B, C, and D are still in the room. Things may have happened that I don't know about.
5. I enter the room. (Now I can see what happens again.)
6. D moves the brick from the bag to the box. (I see this.)

Key observation: In step 6, D moves the brick **from the bag** to the box. This means that while I was outside the room (step 3-4), someone must have moved the brick from the box to the bag. I didn't see that happen, but it must have occurred for D to move it from the bag in step 6.

So after step 6: D moved the brick from the bag to the box. The brick is now in the box.

But wait - could other things have happened while I was outside? Other objects could have been placed in containers. However, I only know about:
- The brick, which is now in the box (I saw D put it there in step 6).

The question is: what is in the box? Based on what I directly observed, the brick is in the box (D moved it there, and I saw this happen). 

Could something else have been placed in the box while I was outside, and then moved before I returned? Possibly, but I have no information about that. Could something have been placed in the box after D put the brick there? The scenario doesn't mention anything else happening after step 6.

The answer should be "brick" and I'm confident about this. I don't need to spend points asking anyone.

Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

The answer is straightforward. I was in the room when C put an apple in the basket, so I know the contents of the basket directly. There's no need to spend points asking or telling anyone.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events I witnessed:

1. I, B, C, D are in the room. Bag, box, basket are empty.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. C puts a stapler in the basket. (I see this)
5. B enters the room.
6. D enters the room.
7. I leave the room. (From this point, I can't see what happens inside)
8. B leaves the room. (I know this)
9. C leaves the room. (I know this)
10. I enter the room. (Now I can see again)
11. D moves the orange from the basket to the bag. (Wait - an orange? I last knew the basket had a stapler. Something must have happened while I was outside.)
12. D moves the orange from the bag to the basket.
13. D leaves the room.
14. D enters the room.
15. I leave the room. (Can't see again)
16. B enters the room. (I know this)
17. B leaves the room. (I know this)

So when I re-entered the room at step 10, I observed D moving an "orange" from the basket to the bag, then back to the basket. This means that while I was outside (steps 7-10), someone must have replaced the stapler with an orange, or added an orange. But wait - each container holds at most one object, so the stapler must have been removed and replaced with the orange before I came back.

When I was outside (steps 7-9), B was in the room briefly, then left, and C was in the room, then left. D was in the room the whole time. So D (and possibly others) could have swapped the stapler for an orange.

At step 12, the orange is in the basket. Then I leave at step 15, and B enters and leaves. During steps 15-17, D is in the room (he entered at step 14 and I don't see him leave), and B enters and leaves. They could have changed things.

I don't know what happened after I left the second time. B was in the room with D - B might know what's currently in the basket.

Let me ask B what's in the basket.

Ask(B, basket)
A answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. Bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. D puts a ball in the box. → Box has ball.
3. I leave the room. → I can no longer see what happens inside.
4. I enter the room. → I can see again.
5. B moves the ball from the box to the basket. → Box is empty, basket has ball.
6. D moves the ball from the basket to the box. → Basket is empty, box has ball.
7. I leave the room. → I can no longer see what happens inside.
8. B leaves the room. → I know B left, but I don't know what happened before B left.

After step 6, the box has the ball. Then I left the room (step 7). After I left, things could have happened that I'm not aware of before B left (step 8). C and D were still in the room after I left, and B was also still in the room until step 8.

So between steps 7 and 8, B, C, and D were in the room. Something could have happened that I don't know about. After step 8, C and D are in the room.

The last state I knew was: box has ball. But things may have changed after I left.

Since I'm uncertain about what happened after I left, I should ask someone who was in the room. B was in the room for some time after I left but then also left - B would know what happened up until B left but not after. C and D are still in the room and know the current state.

However, C and D are on the Red team and might lie to me. B is my teammate and would tell the truth.

B knows the state up until B left the room. After B left, only C and D remain - they could have moved things. So B doesn't necessarily know the current state either.

The question is: did anything happen after I left? The scenario only describes what I can observe. Between me leaving (step 7) and B leaving (step 8), there might have been actions I wasn't told about. And after B left, C and D could have done things.

Since B is my teammate and was in the room after me, let me ask B what's in the box. B would know at least up to when B left.

Ask(B, box)
A answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains banana.

The answer is straightforward. I was in the room when C put an apple in the box, and nothing happened to the box after that while I was still in the room. After I left, C also left, leaving only B and D in the room. I don't know if anything changed after I left, but based on what I observed, the box contains an apple.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

1. Everyone starts in the room. Bag, box, and basket are all empty.
2. D leaves the room.
3. C puts a stapler in the box. (I see this, B sees this, D does not)
4. D enters the room.
5. I leave the room. (From here, I can't see what happens inside)
6. I enter the room. (I can see again)
7. B moves the banana from the box to the basket. (I see this)
8. D moves the banana from the basket to the box. (I see this)
9. D leaves the room.
10. D enters the room.
11. I leave the room. (I can't see what happens after this)
12. C leaves the room.

Wait - step 7 says B moves "the banana" from the box to the basket. But the last thing I saw put in the box was a stapler (step 3). Between steps 5 and 6 (when I was outside), something must have happened that I didn't see - someone must have put a banana in the box (and possibly removed the stapler).

Actually, let me re-read. The scenario says "B moves the banana from the box to the basket." This implies there IS a banana in the box at that point. So between when I left (step 5) and returned (step 6), someone must have swapped the stapler for a banana, or the stapler was removed and a banana placed in the box.

After step 8: D moves the banana from the basket to the box. So the banana is in the box.

After step 8, I'm still in the room. Then D leaves and enters (steps 9-10), and then I leave (step 11). After I leave, C is still in the room (C leaves in step 12). Between steps 11 and 12, C could have done something to the box.

But the scenario describes what I see - since I left in step 11, I wouldn't see anything C does after that. The question is whether C did anything.

The scenario doesn't mention C doing anything after I leave, but that's because I can't see it. C might have changed the box contents.

Based on what I last observed, the banana is in the box. But C might have changed it after I left. However, I have no information about what C did.

The safest answer based on my knowledge is that the banana is in the box. Since I'm being asked directly, I should answer with my best knowledge. Let me just Pass since I'm fairly confident.

Pass
A answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through what I know:

1. **I'm in the room**: B puts a banana in the box. → Box has banana.
2. **I leave the room.** → I can't see what happens, but I know who enters/leaves.
3. **I enter the room.** → I can now see what happens again.
4. **I'm in the room**: C moves the banana from the box to the basket. → Box is empty, basket has banana.
5. **I'm in the room**: D moves the banana from the basket to the box. → Basket is empty, box has banana.
6. **I leave the room.** → I can no longer see what happens.

The key question is: did anything happen after I left the room the second time? The scenario ends with "..." after I leave, which suggests time passes but I don't know what happened during that time.

However, I do know that I wasn't told about anyone entering or leaving the room after I left. Since C and D were in the room when I left, they could have moved objects around without me knowing.

The last state I observed was: **box has banana**. But things could have changed after I left.

Since I'm being asked what's in the box, and I'm uncertain about what happened after I left, I should consider asking someone who was in the room. C and D are opponents and might lie. B - let me check if B was in the room after I left the second time. B was in the room initially, and I don't see B leaving at any point in the scenario, so B should still be in the room and would know the current state.

Let me ask B what's in the box - B is my teammate and has no reason to lie.

Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether B knows the answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a banana in the bag. (Everyone in the room: A, B, C, D)
2. D leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. C moves the banana from the bag to the box. (Only A and C see this)
5. C puts a ball in the bag. (Only A and C see this)
6. C moves the ball from the bag to the basket. (Only A and C see this)
7. C moves the banana from the box to the bag. (Only A and C see this)

So the bag currently contains the **banana**.

B's perspective: B saw me put a banana in the bag, then B left the room. B doesn't know about any of C's moves. So B would think the banana is still in the bag.

B would answer "banana" which is actually correct! The banana is indeed back in the bag after C's series of moves.

Since B will naturally answer "banana" (which is correct), I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: banana

**Current state of the room:**

B was in the room the entire time until they left. B saw:
1. C put a banana in the bag

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether B knows it.

Let me trace through the scenario:
1. C puts a banana in the bag. (Everyone sees this: A, B, C, D)
2. C leaves the room. (A, B, D remain)
3. I move the banana from the bag to the box. (A, B, D see this)
4. I put an orange in the bag. (A, B, D see this)
5. B leaves the room. (A, D remain)
6. D moves the banana from the box to the basket. (A, D see this)
7. I move the banana from the basket to the box. (A, D see this)
8. D moves the banana from the box to the basket. (A, D see this)

So the current state:
- Bag: orange (put there in step 4, never moved)
- Box: empty
- Basket: banana

B left after step 4. At that point, B saw:
- Bag: orange
- Box: banana (but B doesn't need to know about the box)

B knows the bag contains an orange because B was present when I put the orange in the bag (step 4), and nothing happened to the bag after that. B was outside the room for steps 6-8, but those only involved moving the banana around between the box and basket - the bag was untouched.

So B should know the bag contains an orange. B doesn't need any help here.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a banana in the bag. ... C leaves the room. ... You move the banana from the bag to the box. ... You put an orange in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the banana from the box to the basket. ...

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario from B's perspective:

1. Everyone is in the room. C puts a banana in the bag. (B sees this)
2. C leaves the room. (B sees this)
3. I move the banana from the bag to the box. (B sees this)
4. I put an orange in the bag. (B sees this)
5. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
6. D moves the banana from the box to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
7. I move the banana from the basket to the box. (B doesn't see this)
8. D moves the banana from the box to the basket. (B doesn't see this)

So B last saw: bag = orange, box = banana, basket = empty.

The current actual state is:
- Bag: orange (nothing happened to the bag after I put the orange in)
- Box: empty (banana was moved out)
- Basket: banana

The question is: What is in the bag? The answer is **orange**.

B should know this! When B left the room, the bag had an orange in it, and nothing happened to the bag after that. So B should correctly answer "orange" based on their own knowledge.

Since B already knows the correct answer (orange is in the bag), I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario from B's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room. B sees C put a brick in the bag.
2. C leaves the room.
3. B sees me move the brick from the bag to the box.
4. B sees me put an orange in the bag.
5. B leaves the room.
6. After B leaves, D moves the brick from the box to the basket, moves the orange from the bag to the box, then moves the orange from the box back to the bag.

B doesn't see anything after step 5. So B's last knowledge is:
- Bag: orange
- Box: brick
- Basket: empty

The actual current state is:
- Bag: orange
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

The question is: what is in the bag? The correct answer is **orange**.

B last saw the orange in the bag (step 4), and since B left after that, B's belief is that the bag contains the orange. This happens to be correct because D moved the orange out and then back into the bag.

So B should naturally answer "orange" based on their own knowledge, which is the correct answer. I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Current state of containers:

B's knowledge: B saw D put a stapler in the box, then left. B doesn't know about anything after that. So B should know the box contains a stapler.

The question is: "What is in the box?" directed at B.

B saw D put the stapler in the box before leaving. Nothing happened to the box after that - the stapler is still in the box. So B should correctly answer "stapler" based on their own knowledge.

Since B already knows the correct answer (stapler is in the box, and B witnessed it being placed there), I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B anything. I should Pass.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. D puts a ball in the box. (A, B, and D all see this)
2. B leaves the room.
3. After B leaves: D moves the ball from the box to the bag.
4. D puts an apple in the box.
5. D moves the apple from the box to the basket.
6. D moves the ball from the bag to the box.

So the current state is:
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty
- Basket: apple

B saw the ball go into the box, then left. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. So B would think the box still contains the ball.

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to B.

The box currently contains the ball. B believes the box contains the ball (from what B saw before leaving).

So B will likely answer "ball" which is correct! That means we get 1 point without me needing to spend 0.5 points on a Tell action.

I should Pass.

B answers: ball

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a banana in the bag, then left the room.
- After B left, D moved the banana from the bag to the box, and put an orange in the bag.
- C then left the room.
- B doesn't know about the changes D made (B was outside the room).

**What B thinks:** B believes the banana is still in the bag (since B left before the changes).

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the bag. The correct answer is **orange**.

**B's likely answer:** B will probably say "banana" (based on B's last knowledge), which would be **wrong**.

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but a correct answer gives 1 point, netting us +0.5 points.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**Me (A):** I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything:
- D put a ball in the basket
- B left the room
- D left the room
- C moved the ball from the basket to the bag
- C put a stapler in the basket
- So: basket = stapler, bag = ball, box = empty

**B:** B was in the room initially and saw D put a ball in the basket. Then B left. B doesn't know about anything that happened after they left. So B thinks:
- basket = ball
- bag = empty
- box = empty

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the basket. Wait, no - "I am going to ask B what is in the basket." So B will be asked.

B thinks the basket has a **ball** (since B left before C moved the ball and put the stapler in). B will answer "ball," which is **wrong** - the basket actually contains a **stapler**.

Since B is my teammate, I need B to answer correctly. I should tell B what's actually in the basket. This costs 0.5 points but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

If I don't tell B, B will say "ball" and get 0 points. If I tell B the truth, B can say "stapler" and we get 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 points net.

Tell(B, basket, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened and what each player knows:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. D puts a ball in the basket.
2. B leaves the room. (B knows: ball is in basket)
3. D leaves the room.
4. C moves the ball from basket to bag.
5. C puts a stapler in the basket.
6. I move the ball from bag to box.
7. C moves the ball from box to bag.
8. I move the ball from bag to box.

Current state:
- Bag: empty
- Box: ball
- Basket: stapler

B's knowledge: B last saw the ball placed in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So B would think the basket contains the ball.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to B. The correct answer is **stapler**.

B doesn't know this - B would guess "ball" (which is wrong). I need to tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly and we get 1 point. This costs 0.5 points, but getting the answer right earns 1 point, netting us +0.5 points.

Tell(B, basket, stapler)

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts a ball in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens inside.)
4. D leaves the room. (D no longer sees what happens inside.)
5. C moves the ball from the basket to the bag. (Only A and C see this.)
6. C puts a stapler in the basket. (Only A and C see this.)
7. C moves the ball from the bag to the box. (Only A and C see this.)
8. I (A) move the ball from the box to the bag. (Only A and C see this.)

Current state:
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty
- Basket: stapler

B's knowledge: B last saw D put a ball in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B would think the basket still contains the ball.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to B.

B will likely answer "ball" (which is wrong - the basket contains a stapler).

Since B is my teammate, I should tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The Tell action costs 0.5 points, but a correct answer gives 1 point, netting us +0.5 points.

If I Pass, B will likely say "ball" and get 0 points. If I Tell, we spend 0.5 but gain 1.0 for a net of +0.5.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything:
- Bag: empty
- Box: apple
- Basket: stapler

**What B knows:** B was in the room initially and saw D put the apple in the basket. Then B left. B doesn't know about any moves after that. So B thinks:
- Basket: apple (last thing B saw before leaving)
- Bag: empty
- Box: empty

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the basket. B thinks the apple is in the basket, but it's actually the stapler.

Since B is my teammate, I should tell B the correct contents of the basket so B can answer correctly and earn us 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer gives us 1 point, netting 0.5 points.

**Me (A):** I saw everything. The box currently contains a ball. The bag contains a stapler. The basket is empty.

**B:** B saw C put the stapler in the box, then B left the room. B doesn't know about C moving the stapler to the bag or D putting a ball in the box. So B thinks the box contains the stapler.

**C and D:** They both saw everything and know the box contains a ball.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the box?" The correct answer is **a ball**.

B currently thinks the box has a stapler (which is wrong). I need to tell B the correct contents of the box so our team gets the point.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and whether B knows it.

Let me trace through the events:
1. C puts a stapler in the box.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C moves the stapler from the box to the bag.
4. D puts a ball in the box.
5. D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket.
6. I move the stapler from the basket to the bag.
7. D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket.

So currently: the box contains a **ball**, the basket contains a **stapler**, and the bag is **empty**.

B left the room after step 1. B saw the stapler go into the box, but didn't see anything after that. So B thinks the box still contains the **stapler**, but it actually contains a **ball**.

I need to tell B the correct answer since B will be asked what's in the box.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. C puts an orange in the bag.
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves the orange from the bag to the basket.
5. C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.
6. C moves the orange from the bag to the box.
7. D puts a ball in the bag.

So the current state is:
- Bag: ball
- Box: orange
- Basket: empty

B saw: C put an orange in the bag, then B left. B doesn't know about any moves after that. So B thinks the bag still contains the orange.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to B. The correct answer is "ball."

B will likely answer "orange" (which is wrong) because that's the last thing B saw put in the bag before leaving.

I need to tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the correct answer earns 1 point, so net gain is 0.5 points.

If I don't tell B, B will answer "orange" which is wrong, and we get 0 points.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can answer correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw:

1. **B is in the room**: C puts an apple in the bag. (B sees this)
2. **B leaves the room.**
3. **B is outside**: C moves the apple from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)
4. **B enters the room.**
5. **B is in the room**: D moves the apple from the box to the bag. (B sees this)
6. **C leaves the room.** (B sees this)

So B saw:
- Apple put in bag (step 1)
- D moves apple from box to bag (step 5)

B knows the apple is currently in the bag. B can answer this correctly.

The question is "what is in the bag?" and the answer is "apple." B witnessed D move the apple from the box to the bag, so B knows the bag contains the apple.

Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend points telling B.

Pass

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the basket.

Let me trace through B's perspective:

1. B is in the room initially and sees me put a stapler in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. While B is out: C moves the stapler from basket to box. B doesn't see this.
4. B enters the room.
5. D moves the stapler from the box to the basket. B sees this.
6. C leaves the room.
7. D leaves the room.
8. B moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. B does this, so B knows.
9. B puts a ball in the basket. B does this, so B knows.

So B knows that the basket currently contains a ball, because B personally put the ball in the basket.

B will correctly answer "ball" for the basket.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the bag.

Let me trace through what B has seen (B was in the room the entire time):

1. I put an apple in the bag. ✓ B saw this.
2. B puts a stapler in the basket. ✓ B did this.
3. I move the stapler from the basket to the box. ✓ B saw this.
4. C moves the stapler from the box to the basket. ✓ B saw this.
5. I move the stapler from the basket to the box. ✓ B saw this.

So B knows the bag contains an apple. B was present for everything and should be able to answer correctly.

Since B already knows the answer, there's no need to spend 0.5 points telling B.

B answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B needs help answering correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw:

1. B was in the room when I put a banana in the bag. **B saw this.**
2. B leaves the room.
3. While B is outside: D moves the banana from the bag to the box. **B did NOT see this.**
4. B enters the room.
5. After B returns: C moves the banana from the box to the bag. **B saw this.**

So when C moved the banana from the box to the bag, B saw that happen. B knows the banana is now in the bag.

Wait - but does B know it's a banana? When C moved it, B sees "C moves [something] from the box to the bag." But B might not know what the object is since B didn't see it get placed in the box (that happened while B was out).

Actually, let me reconsider. B saw me put the banana in the bag initially. Then B left. While B was gone, D moved the banana from bag to box. B didn't see this. When B returned, C moved the banana from box to bag. B would see C move something from the box to the bag, but B might not know it's the banana specifically - B might think the banana is still in the bag (from when B last saw it) and that some unknown object was moved from the box to the bag.

Actually, B would see C move the banana from the box to the bag - the object being moved is visible. So B would see that it's a banana being moved from box to bag. B would then know the banana is in the bag.

So B should know the banana is in the bag. The correct answer to "what is in the bag?" is "banana."

B should be able to answer this correctly without my help. I'll save the 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the bag and whether I need to help.

Let me trace through what happened:
- We all started in the room (A, B, C, D)
- D puts a stapler in the bag (everyone sees this)
- B puts a banana in the basket (everyone sees this)
- I leave the room
- B leaves the room

After I left, B was still in the room for some time before leaving. So B saw everything that happened up until B left. But the key question is: did anything happen to the bag after B left?

From my perspective, after I left the room, I can't see what happens inside. But I do know that B left the room after me. After B left, C and D were still in the room, and they could have moved things around - but I wouldn't know about that, and neither would B.

Based on what B directly observed: B saw D put a stapler in the bag, and nothing else happened to the bag while B was in the room (at least, nothing was described to me before I left, and B was there longer than me).

Wait - the scenario shows what I see. The "..." between events could mean other things happened that I didn't see after I left. But the events shown are what I observed. After I left, I only know that B left the room.

B saw D put a stapler in the bag. B was in the room after I left, so B might have seen additional changes to the bag. But from what I observed while in the room, the bag contains a stapler, and nothing changed it before I left.

B should know the stapler is in the bag (B saw D put it there). However, after B left, C and D could have changed the bag's contents - but neither B nor I would know about that.

Since B was present when D put the stapler in the bag, B should know the answer is "stapler" based on B's last observation. The risk is if something happened to the bag between when I left and when B left that B saw but I didn't - but B would still know.

B should already know the bag contains a stapler (or whatever it was changed to while B was still there). I don't have additional information that B lacks about the bag. In fact, B might have MORE information than me since B stayed longer.

I'll pass to save points.

Pass

The key question: what happened while I was outside? After I left, B was still in the room with C and D. Then B left, leaving C and D. Then D left, leaving only C. Then D re-entered (C and D in room). Then B entered (B, C, D in room). Then B left.

During the time between when I left and B left (step 3-4), C and D were in the room with B - anything could have happened. Between B leaving and D leaving (steps 4-5), C and D were alone. Between D leaving and D entering (steps 5-6), only C was alone. Between D entering and B entering (steps 6-7), C and D were together. When B entered (step 7-8), B, C, and D were together.

The ball was originally in the bag. C was in the room the entire time and could have moved the ball. Since I can't see what happened, the ball might or might not still be in the bag.

B's knowledge: B was present for some periods but absent for others. Specifically, B was absent between steps 4-7 (when B left and re-entered). During that time, C (and sometimes D) could have moved things. When B re-entered, B wouldn't know if anything changed during their absence.

So B doesn't necessarily know what's in the bag currently. B last saw the ball in the bag, but things could have changed while B was out.

However, I also don't know what's in the bag. Since I can't help B with certainty, and asking anyone costs 0.5 points, I should consider whether it's worth asking.

The most informed player about the current state would be C, who never left the room. But C is on the Red team and could lie.

B saw the ball placed in the bag initially, and was absent for a period where changes could have occurred. B might just answer "ball" based on what they last knew. That could be correct if nothing changed, or wrong if C moved things.

Since I don't have reliable information to share, and asking C (who could lie) costs 0.5 points, I think the best action is to Tell B what I last knew - that the ball is in the bag - reinforcing B's own knowledge. But B already knows this from being present.

Actually, let me just Pass. B already knows the ball was put in the bag, and I have no additional information to offer. Spending 0.5 points to tell B something they already know is wasteful.

Pass
B answers: ball
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- I put a brick in the box.
- C was in the room when I put the brick in the box, so C knows the brick is in the box.
- C then left the room, followed by B leaving.
- After C left, nothing happened to the box (no one moved the brick), so the brick is still in the box.

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put the brick in the box.
- After C left the room, C doesn't know if anything changed. But C does know that B left the room after C did (C can see who enters/leaves).
- C knows that I stayed in the room. C might worry that I moved the brick after C left.

**The question:** C will be asked what's in the box.

Since C saw me put the brick in the box, and C might reason that the brick is still there (or might worry I moved it), C will likely answer "brick" — which would be correct, giving the Red team 1 point.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?** 

I could Tell C something false, like telling C the box contains something else, hoping to mislead C. But C saw me put the brick in the box, and C knows I'm on the opposing team. C would likely distrust any information I give, since I have incentive to mislead C.

If I Tell C false information, C would probably think: "A is on the Blue team and is trying to trick me. I should ignore this." This would cost me 0.5 points and likely not change C's answer.

However, there's a subtle play: if I tell C the truth (that the box has a brick), C might second-guess it, thinking I'm trying to use reverse psychology. But this is risky and still costs 0.5 points.

The safest play is to Pass, since any Tell action costs 0.5 points and C, being a rational player who directly observed the brick being placed, will likely trust their own observation over anything I say.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and whether I need to take any action.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when I put a brick in the box. ✓ C knows the box has a brick.
2. C then left the room.
3. After C left, various things happened with the stapler, but nothing happened to the box.

So C knows the box contains a brick, which is correct. C should answer "brick" correctly, which would give the Red team 1 point.

Wait - C is on the Red team. If C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. I want to prevent that if possible.

But the question is being asked to C, and I can't control C's answer. Let me think about whether I should try to mislead C.

I could Tell C something false about the box to try to confuse them. For example, I could tell C that the box contains something else. But C saw me put the brick in the box with their own eyes, so they'd likely not believe me.

However, C left the room before any changes to the box happened - and in fact, no changes to the box happened at all. The brick is still in the box. C knows this from direct observation.

If I try to Tell C false information, it costs me 0.5 points AND C would likely not believe it since they directly observed the brick being placed in the box. That would be a net loss for my team.

The best action is to Pass, since:
- Any Tell to C with false info costs 0.5 and C likely won't believe it (they saw the brick placed directly)
- Any other action doesn't help prevent C from answering correctly
- Passing costs nothing

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what C saw:
- C was in the room initially when I put a brick in the box.
- C then left the room.
- After C left: B left, D put a ball in the bag, I moved the ball to the basket, D moved it back to the bag, I moved it back to the basket.

So C knows the brick is in the box (C saw me put it there), and nothing happened to the box after that. C should correctly answer "brick" for the box.

Since C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the box, and C knows the correct answer (brick), the Red team will get 1 point if C answers correctly.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell C false information, but C saw me put the brick in the box with their own eyes, so C would likely not believe a lie. Spending 0.5 points to tell C something they won't believe would just cost us points.

The best action is to Pass, since any action would cost 0.5 points without changing the outcome.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and whether C knows this.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a stapler in the box. (Everyone in room: A, B, C, D)
2. C leaves the room.
3. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (C doesn't see this)
4. B puts a banana in the box. (C doesn't see this)
5. D moves the banana from the box to the basket. (C doesn't see this)
6. B moves the stapler from the bag to the box. (C doesn't see this)
7. B leaves the room.

So the box currently contains the **stapler**.

Now, what does C know? C was present when I put the stapler in the box, then C left. After leaving, C knows that D, B, and I were still in the room, and that B eventually left. C doesn't know about any of the moves that happened after they left.

From C's perspective, the last thing they saw was the stapler being put in the box. C might guess "stapler" since that's the last thing they knew was in the box. But C doesn't know for sure since things could have changed after they left.

The question is: should I help C (Red team) or not? C is on the Red team, so I do NOT want C to answer correctly. If C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

The box currently contains the stapler, and C's best guess would likely be "stapler" based on what they last saw. If I tell C something false, it costs me 0.5 points but might cause C to answer incorrectly (saving 1 point for Red).

Let me think about this strategically. If I Tell C that the box contains something else (like "banana" or "nothing"), C might believe me or might not. Since I'm on the opposing team, C might be suspicious. But spending 0.5 points to potentially prevent Red from gaining 1 point could be worth it.

However, the risk is that C might not believe me (since I'm on the opposing team) and still answer "stapler" - then I've lost 0.5 points for nothing.

Alternatively, if I pass, C might guess "stapler" (which is correct) and Red gets 1 point.

I think the best play is to try to mislead C. I'll tell C something false about the box.

Tell(C, box, banana)
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about this carefully.

**What I know:**
- C put an apple in the basket (everyone saw this)
- B left the room
- After B left: C moved the apple from basket to bag, then put a stapler in the basket
- C left the room

**What C knows:**
C was present for all actions until they left. C knows:
- Basket contains: stapler
- Bag contains: apple

C will be asked what's in the basket. C knows the answer is "stapler" and will likely answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?**

If I Tell C false information, C has no reason to believe me over their own memory - they were in the room when they put the stapler in the basket. C would likely ignore any false Tell from me.

If I Ask C something, that just costs us 0.5 points and doesn't help.

**Should I tell B something useful for future rounds?** B left before C moved the apple and put the stapler in the basket. B thinks the basket has the apple. I could tell B useful information, but I don't know what future questions will be asked, so spending 0.5 points speculatively isn't clearly worth it.

Since I can't prevent C from answering correctly (C directly placed the stapler in the basket and remembers this), and any action I take costs 0.5 points, the best move is to Pass.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through what C observed:

1. C starts in the room with everyone. C puts an apple in the basket.
2. B leaves the room. (C sees this)
3. C moves the apple from the basket to the bag. (C knows this)
4. C puts a stapler in the basket. (C knows this)
5. C leaves the room.

After C leaves:
- D moves the apple from the bag to the box.
- I move the apple from the box to the bag.
- D moves the apple from the bag to the box.

C doesn't see any of these later movements. But the question is about the **basket**, not the bag or box.

From C's perspective, C put a stapler in the basket (step 4), and then C left. After C left, the movements only involved the apple being moved between the bag and box. Nobody touched the basket after C put the stapler in it.

So C should know the basket contains the **stapler**. C will likely answer "stapler" which is correct (the stapler is indeed still in the basket since nobody moved it).

This means C answering correctly gives the Red team 1 point. 

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell C wrong information to confuse them, but C was in the room when they put the stapler in the basket, and C knows nothing happened to the basket before they left. C has no reason to trust misinformation from me (an opponent) over their own direct observation.

Any Tell action would cost 0.5 points and is unlikely to trick C since C directly observed putting the stapler in the basket and nothing else happened to the basket before C left. It would be irrational for C to believe me over their own memory.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows.

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone in room: C puts apple in basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C moves apple from basket to bag.
4. C puts stapler in basket.
5. C leaves the room.
6. I move apple from bag to box.
7. D moves apple from box to bag.

**Current state:**
- Bag: apple
- Box: empty
- Basket: stapler

**What does C know?**
C was present for steps 1-4, then left at step 5. C doesn't know about steps 6-7 (my moving the apple or D moving it). But C does know that D stayed in the room, so D could have moved things.

From C's perspective when they left:
- Bag: apple
- Basket: stapler
- Box: empty

C knows D (Red teammate) stayed in the room and could have moved things. C doesn't know what I did or what D did after C left.

**The question is: What is in the basket?**
C last saw the stapler in the basket. Since C left the room, C doesn't know if anything changed. But from C's perspective, the stapler was in the basket when they left.

The actual answer is: **stapler** is in the basket (neither I nor D moved the stapler).

So C will likely answer "stapler" which is correct, earning Red 1 point.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?** I could Tell C false information to mislead them. For example, I could tell C that the basket contains something else, hoping C believes me and gives a wrong answer. But C (a Red team player) would likely not trust me (a Blue team player) since I have incentive to mislead them.

However, it costs 0.5 points to Tell, and if C doesn't believe me, I lose 0.5 for nothing. C would be smart to distrust information from an opponent.

The risk-reward isn't great. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell that C will likely ignore means I'd just lose 0.5 points.

I'll pass.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would be optimal here.

**What I know (Player A):**
- I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything.
- Basket: stapler
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty

**What C knows:**
- C was in the room initially and saw everything until they left.
- C saw: brick put in basket, then brick moved to box, then stapler put in basket.
- C then left the room. After C left, D moved the stapler from basket to bag, then back to basket.
- C doesn't know about D's movements after leaving, so C thinks the basket still has the stapler.

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the basket.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask C what is in the basket." So C will be answering.

C believes the basket contains the **stapler** (since C left before D moved anything, and D moved the stapler away and back, so the basket actually does contain the stapler).

So C's best knowledge says the basket has a stapler, and the actual contents are also a stapler. C should answer correctly on their own.

Since C is on the Red team, if C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. That's bad for me.

Can I do anything to mislead C? I could Tell C false information to try to confuse them. But C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Let me think: C knows they put a stapler in the basket before leaving. If I tell C something different, C might be suspicious since I'm on the Blue team and have incentive to lie. However, C also knows that D was in the room after C left and could have moved things.

I could try: Tell(C, basket, brick) — implying someone moved the brick back to the basket. C might think D rearranged things. But C might also just ignore me since I'm an opponent.

The cost of a Tell is 0.5 points. If it works and C answers wrong, Red doesn't get 1 point. Net benefit for us: -0.5 (cost) but Red loses 1 point they would have gained. That's a relative gain of 0.5.

But if C ignores my lie, we just lose 0.5 points for nothing.

C might reason: "Why would A tell me the truth? A is on the opposing team." So C would likely ignore or distrust my information.

I think the risk isn't worth it. C will likely trust their own memory over an opponent's claim.

C answers: stapler

Since C is on the Red team, C saw the orange being placed in the basket, and C knows the answer is "orange." If C answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - costs nothing, but C will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point).
2. **Tell(C, basket, [something wrong])** - costs 0.5 points to Blue, but I could try to deceive C into thinking the contents changed while they were outside. Since C left the room and doesn't know what happened after leaving, C might believe the basket's contents changed. If C gives a wrong answer, Red gets 0 points, and it only costs us 0.5.

This is the key insight: C left the room, so C doesn't know if something changed after they left. If I tell C something different, C might believe the contents were swapped or changed.

**Tell(C, basket, apple)** - I could lie and tell C the basket now contains an apple (implying someone moved things around after C left). This costs 0.5 points but if C believes me and answers "apple," Red gets 0 points instead of 1 point. Net benefit for us: we lose 0.5 instead of them gaining 1.0.

However, C knows I'm on the opposing team and might not trust me. But C also knows they can't see what happened after they left, so there's genuine uncertainty. It's worth the gamble since the expected value favors attempting the deception.

Tell(C, basket, apple)
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the question will be.

C was in the room when B put an orange in the basket. Then C left the room. After C left, the ball was moved around (box → bag → box), but the basket was never touched after C left. So the orange is still in the basket.

C saw B put the orange in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket before C left. So C should know the basket contains an orange.

Since C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the basket, and C actually knows the correct answer (orange), C will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for the Red team.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly - I can't communicate with C in a way that would help my team (telling C wrong information would cost me 0.5 points, and C has no reason to trust me since I'm on the opposing team). Even if I told C something false about the basket, C saw the orange being placed there and nothing else happened to the basket before C left, so C would likely trust their own memory.

The best action is to Pass, since any action would cost 0.5 points and wouldn't change the outcome.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what C saw before leaving the room:
1. B puts an orange in the basket.
2. Then C leaves the room.

After C left, the banana was moved around between the box and bag, but C doesn't know about any of that. C never saw the banana being placed anywhere.

The question is: What is in the basket?

From C's perspective, C saw B put an orange in the basket, and then C left. C has no information about anything changing in the basket after that. The orange is still in the basket (nothing in the scenario moved the orange).

So C likely knows the answer: the basket contains an orange. C will probably answer "orange" which would be correct, giving the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C something misleading about the basket's contents, but C saw the orange go into the basket with their own eyes. C would likely trust their own observation over what I (an opponent) tell them. In fact, telling C false information would cost my team 0.5 points and C would probably ignore it anyway since they directly observed the orange being placed in the basket.

There's no beneficial action I can take here. Telling C false info costs 0.5 and is unlikely to work since C directly witnessed the orange going in. Asking someone something doesn't help either.

Pass
C answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what C saw before leaving the room:
- B put a brick in the basket
- Then C left the room

So C's last knowledge is: basket has a brick, bag is empty, box is empty.

After C left:
- I moved the brick from basket to bag
- B put an apple in the basket
- I moved the apple from basket to box
- B moved the brick from bag to basket

So the current state is: basket has a brick, box has an apple, bag is empty.

C will be asked what's in the basket. C last saw a brick being put in the basket, so C likely thinks the basket still has a brick. The actual answer is that the basket currently has a brick (since B moved it back).

So C would likely answer "brick" which is actually correct! That would give the Red team 1 point.

I should try to mislead C. I can Tell C false information about the basket to make C change their answer to something wrong.

Since C knows I was in the room and might have seen changes, C might trust information from me. I should tell C something plausible but wrong about the basket's contents.

Tell(C, basket, apple)

This way, C might believe the brick was moved and an apple is now in the basket, leading C to answer "apple" instead of "brick" (which is the correct answer). This costs us 0.5 points but prevents Red from getting 1 point.

Tell(C, basket, apple)
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what action would be most beneficial.

**What happened:**
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) in room. D puts brick in basket.
2. D leaves the room.
3. C moves brick from basket to bag. (D doesn't see this)
4. B puts stapler in basket. (D doesn't see this)
5. B leaves the room.

**What D knows:**
- D saw the brick placed in the basket.
- D then left the room.
- D knows B left the room after them, but doesn't know what happened inside.
- D likely thinks the brick is still in the basket.

**What will D answer?**
D will likely answer "brick" for the basket, since that's the last thing D saw there. But the actual contents of the basket is the **stapler**.

So D will likely answer incorrectly, which means Red gets 0 points. That's good for us!

**Should I take an action?**
- If I Tell D the truth (stapler in basket), that costs us 0.5 points and helps Red score 1 point — net bad for us (-0.5 for us, +1 for Red).
- If I Tell D a lie, it costs 0.5 points. D might get confused but D might still answer brick (wrong) or believe my lie (also wrong). Not worth the cost.
- If I Ask anyone, it costs 0.5 points and doesn't help since I already know everything.

D is likely going to answer "brick" which is wrong. This is the best outcome for Blue — Red scores 0 and we spend nothing.

D answers: brick

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what action would best help my team.

Let me trace through the scenario from each player's perspective:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room initially and saw the empty bag, box, and basket.
- D put a brick in the basket.
- D left the room.
- After leaving, D knows B left the room at some point, but doesn't know what happened inside.
- D thinks: brick is in the basket (last thing D knew before leaving).

**The actual state:**
- Basket: stapler (B put it there after C moved the brick)
- Box: brick (I moved it there last)
- Bag: empty

**D will be asked what's in the basket.** D likely thinks the brick is in the basket (that's the last thing D saw before leaving). The correct answer is "stapler."

Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer **incorrectly**. If D answers "brick," that's wrong, and Red doesn't get a point. That's good for my team.

If I Tell D the truth (that the basket contains a stapler), D might use that information to answer correctly, giving Red a point. That would be bad.

If I Tell D something false, D might get confused but could also become suspicious.

If I Pass, D will likely answer "brick" (what D last saw in the basket), which is wrong. That's the best outcome for my team - Red gets no points and I spend no points.

Pass
D answers: brick

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team.

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: brick
- Box: empty
- Basket: stapler

**What D knows:**
D was in the room when the brick was put in the basket. Then D left. After D left, C moved the brick from basket to bag, B put a stapler in the basket, B left, I moved the brick from bag to box, and C moved the brick from box to bag. D saw none of this.

So D thinks: basket = brick (from when D was last in the room).

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket. The correct answer is "stapler."

D currently believes the basket contains the brick, so D will likely answer "brick" — which is wrong. That's good for my team since D is on the Red team.

**Should I act?** If I Pass, D will likely answer "brick" (wrong), and Red gets 0 points. If I Tell D the truth, I'd be helping the Red team at a cost of 0.5 points to my team. That's bad.

I should not help D. Passing is the best action.

**What's in the basket?** A stapler (B put it there after C moved the banana to the bag).

**What does D know?** D left the room after putting the banana in the basket. D doesn't know about any moves that happened after they left. So D thinks the banana is still in the basket. D will likely answer "banana" — which is **wrong**.

**Since D is on the Red team**, if D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points. That's good for us!

**Should I help D?** Absolutely not — D is on the opposing team. If D answers wrong, that benefits us.

**Could C help D?** C saw everything until B left. C saw B put the stapler in the basket. But C is still in the room, and it's MY turn, not C's. C might get a turn to Tell D the correct answer before D is asked.

**My optimal play:** I should Pass. There's no reason to spend 0.5 points to help the opposing team, and no need to communicate with B (who isn't being asked). D likely believes the banana is in the basket and will answer incorrectly.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an orange in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the orange from the box to the basket. ... C moves the orange from the basket to the box. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the orange from the box to the bag. ... C puts a brick in the box. ...

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**My knowledge (Player A):** I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything:
- D put orange in box
- D left
- B moved orange from box to basket
- C moved orange from basket to box
- B left
- C moved orange from box to bag
- C put brick in box
- Current state: bag=orange, box=brick, basket=empty

**D's knowledge:** D put the orange in the box, then left. After leaving, D knows B left the room, but doesn't know what happened inside. D last saw: orange in box. D doesn't know about any moves after leaving.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the box. D last saw the orange placed in the box and then left. D likely thinks the box still contains the orange (though D knows B and C were in the room and could have moved things).

**Strategy:** D is on the Red team. If D answers correctly (brick), Red gets 1 point. If D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points. 

D will likely guess "orange" since that's what D put there. That would be wrong - the box actually contains a brick. This is good for my team.

Should I Tell D something? If I tell D the truth (box contains brick), D would answer correctly and Red scores. That's bad for us.

Should I tell D something false to reinforce their wrong belief? I could Tell D that the box contains the orange, reinforcing D's existing belief. But D already likely believes that, so it's a waste of 0.5 points.

Could I tell D something else false to confuse them? If D was going to say "orange" (wrong answer), any action I take either costs us 0.5 points or risks helping D.

The best action is to Pass - D will likely answer "orange" (which is wrong), and we don't spend any points.

Pass
D answers: orange
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

I am going to ask C what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What happened:**
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) was in the room.
2. C put an apple in the basket. (Everyone saw this.)
3. C left the room. (C no longer sees what happens.)
4. D left the room. (D no longer sees what happens.)
5. I moved the apple from the basket to the bag. (Only A and B saw this.)
6. B put an orange in the basket. (Only A and B saw this.)

**Current state:**
- Bag: apple
- Basket: orange
- Box: empty

**What C knows:**
- C saw the apple go into the basket.
- C knows they left, then D left, but C doesn't know what happened after that.
- C likely believes the basket still contains the apple.

**The question:** I will ask C what is in the basket.

**C's likely answer:** Apple (since that's the last thing C saw in the basket).

**The correct answer:** Orange.

So C will likely answer "apple," which is wrong. That means Red gets 0 points from this question. This is good for Blue!

**Should I use Tell to help C?** Absolutely not — C is on the Red team. I want C to answer incorrectly.

**Should I Tell C wrong information?** That could backfire — if I tell C something, C might get suspicious and reconsider. Right now C is naturally going to give the wrong answer. Any communication from me (a Blue team player) to C might make C suspicious that I'm trying to mislead them, which could cause them to second-guess and potentially arrive at the right answer.

The best move is to do nothing and let C answer incorrectly based on their outdated information.

Pass
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what C saw:
- C was in the room initially and put an apple in the basket.
- C then left the room.
- After C left, various moves happened that C is unaware of.

So C believes the apple is still in the basket (since C left before any moves happened).

The question is: What is in the basket? The actual answer is an **orange** (B put an orange in the basket after C and D left).

C will likely answer "apple" since that's what C last saw in the basket. That would be wrong - the basket actually contains an orange.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly, this is good for us. I should not help C get the right answer. 

Let me consider if there's any reason to act. Could D have told C something? No - D left before any moves happened too, so D also thinks the apple is in the basket. Neither C nor D knows about the orange.

The best action is to **Pass** - C will almost certainly answer "apple" which is wrong, and the Red team gets no points.

Pass
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what would be optimal here.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room and put an apple in the basket.
2. C left the room.
3. After C left: I moved the apple from basket to bag, B put an orange in the basket, B moved apple from bag to box, I moved apple from box to bag.

C doesn't know about any of these moves after leaving. So C believes the apple is still in the basket.

The question is: What is in the basket? The actual answer is the **orange** (B put it there).

C will likely answer "apple" since that's what C last saw in the basket. That would be wrong, so Red gets 0 points. This is good for us!

Since C is going to answer incorrectly on their own (they think the apple is in the basket, but it's actually the orange), I should just Pass. There's no reason to spend 0.5 points telling C the correct answer, and no reason to ask anyone anything.

Pass
C answers: apple

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would be optimal here.

**What C knows:**
- C was in the room when they put a banana in the basket.
- C then left the room.
- After leaving, C saw D leave the room later, but C doesn't know about any movements of objects that happened after C left.

**So C believes:** The banana is still in the basket (since C doesn't know about any moves after leaving).

**What's actually in the basket:** An orange (B put it there after D left).

**The question:** C will be asked what's in the basket. C will likely answer "banana" based on their knowledge.

**The actual answer is "orange"**, so C will answer incorrectly. This is good for the Blue team - we score 0 points but Red also scores 0 points.

**Should I Tell C something?** If I tell C the truth (orange is in the basket), that would cost us 0.5 points AND help Red score 1 point, netting us -0.5 and them +1. That's terrible.

If I tell C something false, it costs 0.5 points but C might not trust me (I'm on the opposing team from C's perspective). C might ignore it or might believe it.

**Should I do nothing?** If I Pass, C will likely answer "banana" (wrong), Red gets 0 points, Blue gets 0 points. This is the best outcome for Blue since Red doesn't score.

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. D puts an apple in the basket.
2. C leaves the room.
3. D moves the apple from the basket to the bag. (C doesn't see this)
4. C enters the room.
5. D moves the apple from the bag to the basket. (C sees this)
6. A (me) leaves the room.
7. B leaves the room.

So after step 5, the apple is in the basket. C saw step 5 (D moves apple from bag to basket), so C knows the apple is in the basket.

After I left (step 6) and B left (step 7), I don't know if anything else happened. But the scenario doesn't mention any further actions after B leaves, so the apple should still be in the basket.

C is being asked what's in the basket. C knows the apple is in the basket (C saw it moved there in step 5). C is on the Red team, so C will want to answer correctly to earn a point for Red.

The question is: should I try to mislead C? I could Tell C incorrect information about the basket. But C directly witnessed D moving the apple to the basket in step 5, so C already knows the answer. Any attempt to mislead would likely fail and cost me 0.5 points.

Since C already has direct knowledge that the apple is in the basket, there's nothing I can do to change C's answer. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell would be wasteful.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a ball in the bag. (A, B, and C all see this)
2. C puts a brick in the box. (A, B, and C all see this)
3. I move the brick from the box to the basket. (A, B, and C all see this)
4. B moves the brick from the basket to the box. (A, B, and C all see this)
5. I leave the room.

After I leave, I don't know what happens in the room. But the question is about what C knows about the bag.

At the point I left, the bag contains a ball. C was present for all events and saw me put the ball in the bag. Nothing happened to the bag after that (at least while I was in the room).

After I left, something might have happened in the room that I'm unaware of. But C is still in the room, so C would know the current state of the bag.

The question is: what is in the bag? C saw the ball go into the bag. Unless something changed after I left (which C would know about), C should know the bag contains a ball.

Since C is on the Red team, C will answer the question. If C knows the answer correctly, Red gets a point. I can't prevent C from answering correctly since C was in the room the whole time and witnessed everything.

There's nothing I can do to help or hinder here - C has full knowledge. I could try to Tell C false information, but C was present for everything and would know I'm lying. Any action I take would just cost my team 0.5 points.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what C knows about the bag.

Let me trace through C's perspective:

1. C is in the room when I put an orange in the bag. **C sees this.**
2. C leaves the room. **C doesn't see what happens next.**
3. I move the orange from the bag to the box. **C doesn't see this.**
4. C enters the room. **C now sees what happens.**
5. I put a brick in the bag. **C sees this.**
6. I leave the room.

So from C's perspective:
- C saw me put an orange in the bag initially.
- C left and missed me moving the orange from the bag to the box.
- C came back and saw me put a brick in the bag.

Now, C needs to figure out what's in the bag. C knows:
- Orange was in the bag (before leaving)
- Brick was put in the bag (after returning)
- But the bag can only hold one object.

C might think the bag has the brick (since putting the brick in would replace the orange, or C might reason that since the bag can only hold one object, something must have happened to the orange while C was away). Actually, wait - containers can hold at most one object. So when I put the brick in the bag, C would see that succeed, which means the bag must have been empty at that point. But from C's perspective, C thought the orange was still in the bag. C would realize the orange must have been removed while C was away.

So C should know the brick is in the bag currently. The actual contents of the bag is the brick.

Since C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the bag, and C likely knows the answer (the brick), C will probably answer correctly and score a point for Red.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly here - C directly witnessed the brick being placed in the bag. Any Tell action to C would cost us 0.5 points and C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). I could try to mislead C, but C saw the brick go in with their own eyes, so they're unlikely to be fooled.

The best action is to not spend points on a futile attempt to mislead.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a banana in the basket. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... D moves the banana from the basket to the bag. ... B moves the banana from the bag to the basket. ... You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the basket.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events I observed:

1. **I'm in the room with B, C, D.** D puts a banana in the basket.
2. **I leave the room.** I can't see what happens inside, but I know who enters/leaves.
3. **I enter the room.** I can now see what happens again.
4. **D moves the banana from the basket to the bag.** (I see this)
5. **B moves the banana from the bag to the basket.** (I see this)
6. **I leave the room.** I can no longer see what happens inside.
7. **B leaves the room.**

So when I left the room the second time, the banana was in the basket. After I left, things could have happened that I didn't see. Between step 6 (I leave) and step 7 (B leaves), B was still in the room and could have moved things. Also, C and D might still be in the room (I never saw them leave).

The key question is: did anything happen after I left that I couldn't see? The scenario only describes what I can observe. Between my leaving and B leaving, C and/or D could have moved the banana. But I wouldn't know about it.

Based on what I last observed, the banana was in the basket. But things could have changed after I left. C and D are still in the room and could have moved things.

Since I'm being asked what's in the basket, and I'm uncertain about what happened after I left, I should ask someone who was in the room after I left. B was in the room briefly after I left (before B also left), and C and D may still be in the room.

Actually, B left the room after me, so B would have seen anything that happened between my departure and B's departure. But after B left, C and D could still have done things.

Let me ask B what's in the basket - B would know the state at least up until B left. If nothing changed between my leaving and B leaving, the banana is still in the basket.

But wait - asking costs 0.5 points. If I'm fairly confident the answer is "banana" (since that's the last state I saw, and the scenario doesn't hint at further changes), maybe I should just Pass and answer "banana."

The scenario describes everything observable to me, and nothing else happened that I could detect (no additional enter/leave events after B left). The most likely answer is the banana is in the basket.

Pass
A answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

The question asks me what is in the box. I was in the room when I put a banana in the box, and nothing was ever moved out of the box or into the box after that (all subsequent moves involved the brick being moved between the bag and basket). So I know the box contains a banana. No need to spend points asking or telling anyone.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box right now.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room. All containers are empty.
2. C leaves the room.
3. I put a brick in the box. (Box = brick)
4. I leave the room. (I can no longer see what happens inside)
5. I enter the room. (I can see again)
6. D moves the brick from the box to the bag. (Box = empty, Bag = brick)
7. B moves the brick from the bag to the box. (Box = brick, Bag = empty)
8. B leaves the room.
9. B enters the room.
10. I leave the room. (I can no longer see what happens)
11. D leaves the room.

After I left the room (step 10), D was still in the room and B was in the room. Between step 10 and step 11 (when D leaves), something could have happened that I didn't see. But the scenario only describes what I can observe - since I'm outside the room, any actions inside wouldn't be described to me.

Wait, let me re-read: "If an object is put or moved into a container while a player is outside the room, it will not be described to that player."

So between steps 10 and 11, D and B were both in the room. Something might have happened that I wasn't told about. The last state I observed was the brick in the box (after step 7).

Since B is my teammate and was in the room after I left, B would know if anything changed. Let me ask B what's in the box.

Actually, B was in the room the entire time after step 9 until... the scenario ends. B would have seen everything that happened after I left. Let me ask B.

But asking costs 0.5 points. If I'm confident the answer is "brick" (because nothing may have changed), I could just Pass. But there's a risk that D or B moved something after I left.

Since I can't be sure what happened after I left, I should ask B.

Ask(B, box)
A answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box right now.

Let me trace through the events:

1. C puts a ball in the box. (I see this)
2. I leave the room. (I can no longer see what happens inside)
3. I enter the room. (I can see again)
4. C moves the ball from the box to the basket. (I see this)
5. B moves the ball from the basket to the box. (I see this)
6. I leave the room. (I can no longer see what happens inside)

At the point I left the room the second time, the ball was in the box. The question is whether anything happened after I left.

The scenario ends with "..." after I leave, which could mean something happened that I'm not aware of. However, I don't know of any specific events after I left - I would know if anyone entered or left the room, but no such events are described.

Since B, C, and D were all in the room when I left, and no one is described as entering or leaving after that, they're all still in the room. Something could have happened (objects moved between containers) that I wouldn't know about.

But based on what I last saw, the ball was in the box. The risk is that someone moved it after I left.

I could Ask B what's in the box (costs 0.5 points), and B would know the current state since B is still in the room. B is my teammate, so B would likely tell the truth.

The question is: is it worth spending 0.5 points to be sure? If I'm right without asking, I get 1 point (net 1). If I ask and get the right answer, I get 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 points. If I'm wrong without asking, I get 0 points. If I ask and get the right answer, 0.5 points.

The "..." suggests something might have changed. Given that C and D (opponents) are in the room, they might have moved the ball to sabotage my answer. This is a strategic game, so it's plausible.

I think the safe play is to ask B, since the potential loss from guessing wrong (0 points) vs. the guaranteed gain from asking (0.5 points if correct) makes it worthwhile when there's meaningful uncertainty.

Ask(B, box)
A answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can correctly answer what's in the basket.

Let me trace through what B saw before leaving the room:
1. Everyone starts in the room with empty bag, box, and basket.
2. C puts a banana in the basket. (B saw this)
3. B leaves the room.

After B left:
- D leaves the room
- I put a ball in the box
- C moves the ball from the box to the bag
- I move the ball from the bag to the box

So B knows the basket contains a banana (B saw C put it there), and nothing happened to the basket after B left.

B should know the answer is "banana" without any help from me. But to be safe, let me consider whether B might be confused. B saw the banana go into the basket and then left. Nothing happened to the basket after that. B should confidently know the basket contains a banana.

I'll save the 0.5 points and pass.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**What I know (Player A):**
- Basket: banana (C put it there, and it was never moved)
- Bag: apple (C moved it there last)
- Box: empty (apple was moved out)

**What B knows:**
B was present when C put the banana in the basket. Then B left the room. B didn't see anything after that. So B knows:
- Basket: banana (B saw C put it there before leaving)
- Box: empty (as far as B knows, nothing was put in the box before B left)
- Bag: empty (as far as B knows)

Wait - B left before I put the apple in the box and all the subsequent moves. So B knows the basket has a banana, but doesn't know about the apple movements.

**The question is: What is in the basket?**
The answer is: banana.

B actually knows this! B was in the room when C put the banana in the basket, and the banana was never moved from the basket. B should correctly answer "banana."

Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B. I should Pass.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. All containers are empty.
2. C puts an orange in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
4. C moves the orange from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
5. D puts a brick in the basket. (B doesn't see this)
6. C moves the brick from the basket to the box. (B doesn't see this)
7. D moves the orange from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
8. D leaves the room.

So the final state is:
- Basket: orange
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty

B's knowledge (last saw the room before leaving):
- Basket: orange (from step 2)
- Bag: empty
- Box: empty

B thinks the basket has an orange, which happens to be correct! The orange was moved away and then moved back.

Since B will be asked what's in the basket, and B believes it's the orange (from what they saw before leaving), and it actually IS the orange (since D moved it back), B will likely answer "orange" correctly without any help from me.

I should Pass to save the 0.5 points, since B's natural answer should be correct.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a stapler in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... C puts a banana in the box. ... B leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the box.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can answer correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room initially and saw me put a stapler in the box.
2. D left the room (B was still inside).
3. B moved the stapler from the box to the bag (B knows this).
4. C put a banana in the box (B was still in the room and saw this).
5. B left the room.

So B saw everything that happened. B knows:
- The box contains a banana (C put it there after B moved the stapler to the bag).

Since B knows the box contains a banana, B can answer correctly without my help.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) in room. I put stapler in box.
2. D leaves the room.
3. B moves stapler from box to bag.
4. C puts banana in box.
5. B leaves the room.
6. I move stapler from bag to basket.
7. C moves stapler from basket to bag.
8. I move stapler from bag to basket.

Current state: Box has banana, bag is empty, basket has stapler.

Now, what does B know? B was present for steps 1-5, then left. At the time B left:
- Box had banana (C put it there)
- Bag had stapler (B moved it there)
- Basket was empty

After B left (steps 6-8), B doesn't know about any movements. So B thinks:
- Box: banana
- Bag: stapler
- Basket: empty

The question is: "What is in the box?" The correct answer is **banana**.

B thinks the box has a banana, which is actually correct! B should answer "banana" based on their knowledge, and that's the right answer.

So I don't need to spend points telling B anything - B's knowledge already leads to the correct answer.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Let me trace through the events:

2. I put a stapler in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. B moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (A, B, C see this)
5. C puts a banana in the box. (A, B, C see this)
6. B leaves the room.
7. C moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. (A, C see this - B doesn't)
8. I move the stapler from the basket to the bag. (A, C see this - B doesn't)
9. C moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. (A, C see this - B doesn't)

Current state of containers:
- Box: banana
- Bag: empty
- Basket: stapler

What B knows:
- B was present through step 5.
- B saw the stapler moved from box to bag (step 4).
- B saw banana put in the box (step 5).
- B then left and doesn't know about steps 7-9.

So B last knew: box = banana, bag = stapler, basket = empty.

B will be asked what's in the box. From B's perspective, the box contains a **banana** (which is correct!).

B should know the correct answer already - the banana was put in the box while B was present, and nothing happened to the box after B left. The box still contains the banana.

So B should answer "banana" which is correct. I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: banana

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. I put a ball in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. B moves the ball from the bag to the box. (A, B, C see this)
5. C puts a banana in the bag. (A, B, C see this)
6. B leaves the room.
7. C moves the ball from the box to the basket. (Only A and C see this)
8. C moves the banana from the bag to the box. (Only A and C see this)
9. C moves the banana from the box to the bag. (Only A and C see this)

Current state of containers:
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: ball

What B knows (B left after step 5):
- B saw the ball moved to the box (step 4)
- B saw the banana put in the bag (step 5)
- B doesn't know about steps 7-9

So B thinks:
- Bag: banana
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

The question is: What is in the bag?

The actual answer is **banana**. B thinks the bag contains **banana** (from step 5, which B witnessed before leaving).

So B's belief about the bag is actually correct! The banana was put in the bag while B was present, and although C moved it out and back in after B left, it ended up back in the bag.

B should answer "banana" and that would be correct. No need to spend points on a Tell action.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room when I put an orange in the bag. ✓ B knows the bag has an orange.

3. After B left: C put a ball in the box, I moved the ball to the basket, D moved the ball to the box, C moved the ball to the basket. B didn't see any of this.

The question is about the bag. The orange was put in the bag and was never moved out. So the bag still contains the orange.

B saw me put the orange in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. B knows the bag contains an orange.

B should be able to answer correctly without any help. I'll save the 0.5 points.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and tell B, since B will be asked about it.

Let me trace through the events:

1. I put a brick in the box. (Everyone sees this)
2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. C moves the brick from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. D puts an orange in the box. (B doesn't see this)
5. C moves the orange from the box to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
6. D moves the brick from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)

So the final state is:
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty
- Basket: orange

B last saw me put a brick in the box, and then left. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. So B would think the box still contains the brick.

Wait - B would actually guess "brick" which is correct! The brick ended up back in the box.

Since B's natural guess would be "brick" (the last thing B saw in the box), and the box actually contains the brick, B would answer correctly without any help.

I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what I should do.

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone was in the room. I put an orange in the bag.
2. B left the room.
3. After B left: C moved the orange from the bag to the box, and C put an apple in the bag.
4. D left the room.

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put an orange in the bag.
- B then left the room, so B does NOT know about C's actions.
- B thinks the bag still contains the orange.

**What's actually in the bag:**
- An apple (C put it there after moving the orange to the box).

**The question will be asked to B: "What is in the bag?"**
- B will likely answer "orange" based on their last knowledge, but the correct answer is "apple."
- B answering incorrectly means Blue gets 0 points.

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... D puts a brick in the box. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the box.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I was in the room the entire time. I saw:
- D put a stapler in the box
- C left the room
- B left the room
- D moved the stapler from the box to the bag
- D put a brick in the box

So the box currently contains a **brick**.

**What B knows:** B was in the room when D put the stapler in the box. Then C left, then B left. B did NOT see D move the stapler to the bag or put the brick in the box. So B thinks the box still contains a **stapler**.

**I need B to answer correctly that the box contains a brick.** B currently believes it's a stapler, so I need to tell B the correct contents.

Tell(B, box, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and whether B knows it.

Let me trace through the events:
1. Everyone starts in the room.
2. D puts a stapler in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
6. D puts a brick in the box. (B doesn't see this)
7. D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)
8. I move the stapler from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
9. D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. (B doesn't see this)

So the current state:
- Box: brick
- Basket: stapler
- Bag: empty

B last saw the stapler being put in the box, and then left. B doesn't know about any changes after that. So B would think the box contains a stapler, but it actually contains a brick.

I need to tell B what's in the box so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Tell(B, box, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box and whether B knows the answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts a stapler in the box. (Everyone sees this.)
3. C leaves the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (Only A and D see this.)
6. D puts a brick in the box. (Only A and D see this.)
7. I (A) move the stapler from the bag to the basket. (Only A and D see this.)
8. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (Only A and D see this.)

So the current state is:
- Bag: stapler
- Box: brick
- Basket: empty

B left the room after step 2, so B only knows that D put a stapler in the box. B doesn't know about any changes after that. B would think the box contains a stapler, but the correct answer is **brick**.

I need to tell B what's in the box so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts a ball in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room.
4. B leaves the room.
5. D moves the ball from the box to the basket. (Only A and D see this)
6. D moves the ball from the basket to the box. (Only A and D see this)
7. D moves the ball from the box to the bag. (Only A and D see this)
8. D puts a brick in the box. (Only A and D see this)

So the current state is:
- Bag: ball
- Box: brick
- Basket: empty

B left the room after seeing D put a ball in the box. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B thinks the box still contains a ball.

I will be asked about what B thinks is in the box. Wait, no - the question is directed at B. B will be asked what is in the box.

B believes the box contains a **ball** (since B left before any moves happened). The actual answer is a **brick**.

If I don't tell B, B will answer "ball" which is wrong - Blue gets 0 points.
If I tell B the correct answer (brick), it costs 0.5 points but B answers correctly for 1 point, netting +0.5 points.

So I should tell B what's actually in the box.

Tell(B, box, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out the best action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** The basket currently contains a brick. The bag contains the stapler. The box is empty. I saw everything because I was in the room the whole time.

**What B knows:** B saw me put the stapler in the basket initially. Then B left the room. B doesn't know about D moving the stapler to the bag or D putting a brick in the basket. So B thinks the basket still contains the stapler.

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the basket. The correct answer is **a brick**.

B will likely answer "stapler" based on their outdated knowledge, which would be **wrong**. I need to tell B the correct contents of the basket.

B doesn't know this - B would guess "stapler." I need to tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly and we get 1 point.

The cost of a Tell action is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we get 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points. If I Pass, B will likely answer "stapler" (wrong) and we get 0 points.

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the bag.

Let me trace through B's perspective:
1. B is in the room when I put a brick in the bag. B knows: bag has brick.
2. B leaves the room. B doesn't see C move the brick from bag to box.
3. B is outside when C moves the brick from bag to box. B doesn't know this happened.
4. B enters the room. B doesn't see C move the brick from box to bag (this happens while B is in the room... wait, let me re-read.

Let me re-read carefully:
1. A, B, C are in the room. A puts brick in bag. (All see this)
2. B leaves the room.
3. C moves brick from bag to box. (B doesn't see this)
4. B enters the room.
5. C moves brick from box to bag. (B sees this, since B is now in the room)
6. C leaves the room.

So when B enters the room in step 4, then in step 5, C moves the brick from the box to the bag. B sees this happen.

From B's perspective:
- B knew brick was in the bag (from step 1)
- B missed step 3 (brick moved to box)
- B sees step 5: C moves brick from box to bag

So B sees C move the brick from the box to the bag. B now knows the brick is in the bag.

The actual state: the brick is in the bag.

B should correctly know the brick is in the bag. B will be asked what's in the bag, and B should answer "brick" correctly.

Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

B saw the brick being put in the bag. Then D and C left. After that, I moved the brick from the bag to the box and put an apple in the bag. B was in the room the entire time, so B saw all of these actions.

B knows:
- The brick was moved from the bag to the box
- An apple was put in the bag

So B knows the bag contains an apple. B will answer correctly.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a brick in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... You move the brick from the bag to the box. ... You put an apple in the bag. ... B moves the brick from the box to the basket. ... You move the brick from the basket to the box. ... B moves the brick from the box to the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether B knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a brick in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. C leaves the room.
5. I move the brick from the bag to the box. (B sees this)
6. I put an apple in the bag. (B sees this)
7. B moves the brick from the box to the basket. (I see this)
8. I move the brick from the basket to the box. (B sees this)
9. B moves the brick from the box to the basket. (I see this)

So the current state is:
- Bag: apple
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

B was in the room the entire time and saw everything I saw. So B knows the bag contains an apple.

Since B knows the correct answer (apple is in the bag), I don't need to spend points telling B. I'll pass.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out what's happening and what B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. B puts a brick in the bag.
3. D leaves the room.
4. C leaves the room.
5. I move the brick from the bag to the box.
6. I put an apple in the bag.
7. B moves the brick from the box to the basket.
8. I move the brick from the basket to the box.
9. B moves the brick from the box to the basket.
10. I move the brick from the basket to the box.

B was in the room the entire time, so B saw everything. B knows:
- The bag contains an apple (I put it there in step 6)
- The box contains the brick (I moved it there in step 10)
- The basket is empty

So B knows the bag contains an apple. B will answer correctly.

Wait, let me reconsider - the question is asking B what's in the bag. B knows the apple is in the bag because B was present for all actions. B should answer "apple" correctly, earning us 1 point.

Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend 0.5 points to tell B anything.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what B knows:

1. B starts in the room and puts a stapler in the box.
2. B leaves the room — B misses everything that happens while away.
3. While B is out: D moves the stapler from box to basket.
4. B enters the room — B is now back but doesn't know what happened while away.
5. C moves the stapler from basket to box (B sees this).
6. D leaves the room.
7. C leaves the room.
8. I (A) move the stapler from box to bag (B sees this).
9. I (A) put an apple in the box (B sees this).

So B was present for steps 5-9. B saw:
- C move the stapler from basket to box
- D leave
- C leave
- Me move the stapler from box to bag
- Me put an apple in the box

B knows the apple is in the box. B will be asked what's in the box, and B should answer "apple" correctly.

Since B has the correct information already, I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B anything. The best action is to Pass.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can answer correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. B was in the room when D put a stapler in the box.
2. B left the room.
3. While B was outside: D moved the stapler from the box to the bag.
4. B entered the room.
5. B was in the room when D put a banana in the box.

So B saw the stapler go into the box initially, then left. When B came back, B saw D put a banana in the box. 

The question is: does B know what's currently in the box?

B saw D put a banana in the box (step 5), so B knows a banana is in the box. But wait - B also saw a stapler put in the box earlier (step 1) and didn't see it removed. So from B's perspective, B might think the stapler was still in the box when the banana was placed there. But containers can only hold one object, so B might be confused.

Actually, let me reconsider. B saw the stapler placed in the box, then left. B didn't see the stapler moved. When B returned, B saw D put a banana in the box. Since each container holds at most one object, B might reason that the stapler must have been removed at some point while B was away. But B directly witnessed the banana being placed in the box, so B should know the box currently contains a banana.

The correct answer is: the box contains a banana.

B likely knows this since B directly saw D put a banana in the box. B should be able to answer correctly.

I'll Pass to save the 0.5 points.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Action: Looking at this situation, I need to figure out if B knows what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the events from B's perspective:

1. B starts in the room with everyone.
2. C leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. **While B is outside**: I put a ball in the basket. B doesn't see this.
5. B enters the room. (B doesn't know what happened while away.)
6. C enters the room.
7. B puts a banana in the box.
8. C leaves the room.
9. C enters the room.
10. I leave the room.

So B was **outside the room** when I put the ball in the basket. B does NOT know what's in the basket.

Since I'm about to be asked (well, B is about to be asked) what's in the basket, and B doesn't know, I should tell B.

Action: The question will be asked to B about the basket's contents.

Let me trace through what B knows:

1. B was in the room initially (all empty containers).
2. C leaves the room. B is still inside.
3. B leaves the room. (B is now outside.)
4. I (A) put a ball in the basket. **B is outside, so B doesn't see this.**

7. D puts a banana in the box. **B sees this.**
8. B leaves the room.

10. I (A) leave the room.

So B knows about the banana in the box (saw it directly), but B does **not** know about the ball in the basket. B was outside when I placed the ball in the basket, and nobody has told B.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and tell B, since B will be asked about it.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. Bag, box, basket are all empty.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D puts a ball in the basket.
4. I put a banana in the bag.
5. D moves the banana from the bag to the box.
6. I move the banana from the box to the bag.
7. I leave the room.

B left the room before anything was placed in containers, so B doesn't know what's in any container. After I left, something might have happened, but I wouldn't know about it.

At the time I left the room:
- Basket: ball
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty

However, after I left, C and D are still in the room and could have moved things. I don't know if anything changed after I left. But based on what I last saw, the basket contains a ball.

Since B has no information about the basket's contents (B left before anything happened), I should tell B what I know.

The risk is that C or D moved things after I left, but I have to go with my best information.

Tell(B, basket, ball)
B answers: ball

5. C moves the apple from the box to the bag.
6. I move the apple from the bag to the box.
7. I leave the room.

After I leave, I don't know if anything else happened. But based on what I saw before leaving:
- **Basket**: ball (put there in step 2, never moved)
- **Box**: apple (moved there in step 6)
- **Bag**: empty

B left before any objects were placed, so B has no idea what's in any container. B needs to know the basket contains a ball.

However, after I left the room, C and D are still inside and could have moved things. But I have to act on the information I have. The ball was in the basket and was never moved while I was in the room. It's possible C or D moved it after I left, but I can't know that. The best I can do is tell B what I last knew.

Tell(B, basket, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the basket and whether I need to help.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room (empty bag, box, basket).
2. B leaves the room.
3. D puts an orange in the basket. (B is outside, so B doesn't see this. A, C, D see it.)
4. A (me) leaves the room.
5. C leaves the room.
6. C enters the room. (C can now see the current state of the room.)
7. B enters the room. (B can now see the current state of the room.)
8. B leaves the room.

Wait - when B enters the room in step 7, can B see what's in the containers? The rules say "Players cannot see inside containers." So B entering the room doesn't let B see what's inside the basket. B would only know about things that happen while B is in the room.

So when B enters the room in step 7, B cannot see inside the basket. Nothing happens to the basket while B is in the room (between steps 7 and 8). So B doesn't know what's in the basket.

B knows:
- The basket was empty when B left initially.
- B was outside when the orange was placed in the basket.
- B re-entered and then left, but nothing happened to the basket while B was present.

So B doesn't know the basket contains an orange. I need to tell B.

Tell(B, basket, orange)
B answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- I put a ball in the box.
- Everyone (A, B, C, D) was in the room when I put the ball in the box, so everyone saw it.
- Then B left, then D left.
- Nothing else happened to the box after I put the ball in it.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the box.

**What D knows:** D was in the room when I put the ball in the box. D saw the ball go into the box. After D left, nothing happened to the box (as far as the scenario describes). D knows the ball is in the box.

**D's incentive:** D is on the Red team. If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. D knows the answer is "ball" and will likely say "ball" to earn a point for Red.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?** 

- I could Tell D false information, like Tell(D, box, "shoe") to try to mislead D. But D already knows the ball is in the box because D was present when it happened. D would have no reason to believe my lie over their own direct observation. This would cost me 0.5 points for nothing.

- I could Tell or Ask B something, but B isn't being asked the question, so that doesn't help here.

Since D directly witnessed me putting the ball in the box, and nothing changed after that, D knows the correct answer. Any attempt to mislead D would cost 0.5 points and almost certainly fail since D has firsthand knowledge. The best move is to not waste points.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the right answer is.

**Current state of the room:**
- Box: ball (I put it there, and it was never moved)
- Bag: brick (C moved it back there)
- Basket: empty

**What D knows:**
- D was in the room when I put the ball in the box.
- D left the room before C put the brick in the bag and before any subsequent moves.
- So D knows the box contains a ball.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the box.

D was present when I put the ball in the box, and the ball was never moved from the box. D should know the answer is "ball."

Since D is on the Red team and will be asked the question, if D answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point. I don't want that.

However, I can't prevent D from answering correctly since D directly witnessed me putting the ball in the box. Any Tell action to D with false information would cost me 0.5 points, and D has no reason to trust me (an opponent) over their own direct observation.

I could try to Tell D false information, but D saw me put the ball in the box with their own eyes. They would likely ignore my lie. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell that D will ignore would just hurt my team.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

D answers: ball

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

**Current state of containers:**
- Box: ball
- Bag: banana
- Basket: empty

**What D knows:**
D was in the room when I put the ball in the box. Then B left, then D left. After D left, various movements of the banana happened, but D doesn't know about those. However, the question is about the box.

D saw me put the ball in the box. After D left, nothing happened to the box - the ball is still there. So D should know the box contains a ball.

Since D is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the box, and D correctly knows it's a ball, D will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for the Red team.

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - I can't communicate with D (well, I could Tell D false information, but D saw me put the ball in the box and would likely trust their own observation over my tell). 

Let me consider: if I Tell D something false about the box, D might get confused. But D directly witnessed me putting the ball in the box, and nothing happened to the box after that from D's perspective (D left the room and no one told D otherwise). D would likely trust their own memory.

Spending 0.5 points to try to deceive D is risky - D will probably still answer "ball" correctly. It's not worth the cost.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to figure out what D knows and what the right answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. I put a brick in the bag.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. After D leaves: C moves the brick from bag to box, puts banana in bag, moves banana from bag to basket, moves brick from box to bag.

So the current state: **brick is in the bag**, banana is in the basket, box is empty.

Now, what does D know? D was in the room when I put the brick in the bag. Then D left the room. D is unaware of anything that happened after leaving. So D thinks the brick is still in the bag.

D will be asked what's in the bag. D believes it's the brick, and it actually IS the brick (since C moved it back). So D would answer "brick" which is correct — giving the Red team 1 point.

I want to prevent D from answering correctly. I could Tell D false information about the bag to mislead them. But wait — D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. However, D doesn't know what happened after leaving, so if I tell D something plausible...

Actually, D saw me put the brick in the bag, then left. D knows C stayed in the room. D might suspect C moved things around. If I tell D the bag contains something else, D might or might not believe me.

But the thing is — D already thinks the brick is in the bag (which is correct). If I tell D something different, D might get confused and change their answer, or they might ignore me since I'm on the opposing team.

Let me think about the cost: Telling costs 0.5 points. If it successfully misleads D, Red gets 0 points instead of 1 point, netting us +0.5 relative advantage. If D ignores my lie, we lose 0.5 points and Red still gets 1 point.

D is likely to be suspicious of information from an opponent. But D also knows that C was in the room and could have moved things. If I tell D the bag contains something else (like banana), D might consider it plausible that C moved the brick out and put a banana in.

I think the potential benefit outweighs the risk. Let me try to mislead D.

Tell(D, bag, banana)
D answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when D put a banana in the box.
2. C was in the room when B left.
3. C was in the room when D moved the banana from the box to the bag.
4. C was in the room when C put a ball in the box.
5. C then left the room.

So C knows that the box contains a ball (since C put it there, and nothing changed before C left).

Since C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the box, C knows the correct answer: **a ball**. C will answer correctly and Red will get 1 point.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly - C directly witnessed and performed the action of putting the ball in the box. Any Tell action I send to C would cost us 0.5 points, and C has no reason to believe misinformation from me (an opponent). Trying to mislead C would just waste our points.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through what C observed:
1. C was in the room initially and saw D put a banana in the box.
2. C was in the room when B left.
3. C was in the room when D moved the banana from the box to the bag.
4. C put a ball in the box.
5. C left the room.

After C left, C doesn't know about any further movements. So from C's perspective:
- The bag contains the banana
- The box contains the ball
- The basket is empty

The question is: "What is in the box?" asked to C.

C will likely answer "ball" based on what C last knew.

Now, what's actually in the box? Let me trace the full sequence:
1. D puts banana in box → box: banana
2. D moves banana from box to bag → box: empty, bag: banana
3. C puts ball in box → box: ball
4. D moves banana from bag to basket → basket: banana
5. I move banana from basket to bag → bag: banana
6. D moves banana from bag to basket → basket: banana

So the box currently contains the ball. C will answer "ball" which is actually correct!

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's anything I can do. I could try to Tell C wrong information to confuse them, but C saw the ball being placed in the box themselves and nothing happened to the box after that from C's perspective. C would have no reason to trust me over their own memory.

However, it's worth trying to mislead C. I could tell C that the box contains something else, hoping C doubts their memory. But C directly put the ball in the box - they'd be very confident about this.

The cost of a Tell is 0.5 points, and the chance of successfully misleading C about something C personally did is very low. It's probably not worth the 0.5 point cost.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through the scenario from C's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room.
2. D puts a banana in the box. (C sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (C sees this)
4. D moves the banana from the box to the bag. (C sees this)
5. C puts a ball in the box. (C does this)
6. C leaves the room. (C is now outside)
7. After C leaves: I move the banana from the bag to the basket, D moves it back to the bag, I move it back to the basket.

From C's perspective, when C left the room:
- Bag: banana
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

C will be asked what is in the box. C believes the ball is in the box (since C put it there and nothing changed before C left). The ball IS still in the box (nobody moved the ball after C put it there).

So C will likely answer "ball" which is **correct** — the ball is indeed still in the box. That would give the Red team 1 point.

I can't prevent C from answering correctly since C knows the box contents. There's no way for me to deceive C here — if I Tell C something false about the box, C has no reason to believe me (I'm on the opposing team). In fact, trying to tell C false information might backfire since C already knows what's in the box from direct observation.

The best move is to Pass and save the 0.5 points.

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and what the right answer is, then decide if I should help C (Red team) or not.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone starts in the room. D puts orange in box.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves orange from box to bag. (A, C, D see this)
4. C puts ball in box. (A, C, D see this)
5. C leaves the room.
6. After C leaves: D moves orange from bag to basket, D moves ball from box to bag, D moves ball from bag to box.

So the current state is:
- Bag: empty
- Box: ball
- Basket: orange

C's perspective: C last saw the room when they left. At that point:
- Box: ball (C put it there)
- Bag: orange (D moved it there)
- Basket: empty

After C left, D made several moves that C doesn't know about. So C thinks the box has a **ball** in it.

The actual contents of the box: **ball**.

So C's belief (ball) matches reality (ball). C will likely answer "ball" correctly, earning Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C wrong information to mislead them. For example, I could tell C that the box contains something else, like the orange. Since C knows I was in the room the whole time, C might trust me. But it costs 0.5 points.

If I Tell C the box contains "orange," C might believe me and answer "orange" (wrong), costing Red 0 points and costing Blue 0.5 points. Net result: Blue at -0.5, Red at 0.

If I Pass, C will likely answer "ball" (correct), giving Red 1 point. Net result: Blue at 0, Red at 1.

So telling C wrong info: Blue -0.5, Red 0 (Blue is 0.5 behind).
Passing: Blue 0, Red 1 (Blue is 1 behind).

It's better to lose 0.5 points than to let Red gain 1 point. I should try to mislead C.

I'll tell C the box contains the orange (a lie), hoping C trusts me since I was in the room the whole time and saw everything after C left.

Tell(C, box, orange)
C answers: orange

- Nothing else happened after D left.

So D saw C put the banana in the box, and nothing changed after D left. D knows the box contains a banana.

**The question:** I (the game) will ask D what is in the box.

D is on the Red team. D knows the answer (banana) and will answer correctly, earning 1 point for the Red team.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - costs nothing. D will correctly answer "banana" and Red gets 1 point. Score: Blue 0, Red 1.
2. **Tell(D, box, [something wrong])** - costs 0.5 points for Blue. But D already knows the banana is in the box (D was present when it happened), so D would ignore my lie and still answer correctly. Score: Blue -0.5, Red 1.
3. **Ask** someone - costs 0.5 points and doesn't help here.

Since D was in the room when the banana was placed in the box, D already knows the correct answer. There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly. Any action I take would just cost my team 0.5 points.

Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room when C put a banana in the box.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: I put a ball in the bag, B moved the ball from bag to basket, C moved the ball from basket to bag.

So D knows that a banana was put in the box, and D was not present for any changes to the box. The banana is still in the box (nobody moved it).

D will be asked what is in the box. D knows a banana was placed in the box and left before anything else happened. The banana is still in the box since no one moved it.

D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly - "banana" - since D saw C put the banana in the box and nothing happened to the box after that.

Since D is on the opposing team and will likely answer correctly, I want to mislead D. I could Tell D false information about the box to try to confuse them. However, D saw the banana placed in the box with their own eyes, so they might not believe me.

But it's worth considering: D might think something changed after they left. If I tell D something different is in the box, D might doubt their knowledge since things could have changed while they were out. Let me try to mislead D.

Tell(D, Box, Ball)
D answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
- D was in the room when C put a banana in the box.
- D then left the room.
- After D left: I put a stapler in the bag, C moved the stapler from bag to basket, B moved the stapler from basket to bag, I moved the stapler from bag to basket.

D doesn't know about any of the stapler movements since they left before those happened. But D **does** know that C put a banana in the box, and nothing happened to the box after that.

So D knows the box contains a banana. D will answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell D incorrect information about the box to try to mislead them. But D saw the banana being placed in the box with their own eyes, and nothing happened to the box while D was away, so D has no reason to doubt their own knowledge. D would likely ignore my misinformation.

However, it's worth trying since the cost is only 0.5 points. If D trusts my Tell, Red gets 0 points and Blue loses 0.5 (net: Blue ahead by 0.5 relative to Red getting the point). If D ignores it, Red gets 1 point and Blue loses 0.5 (net: Blue behind by 1.5).

Actually wait - D knows the banana was in the box and D left the room. D might think something changed while they were gone. If I tell D something different is in the box, D might believe things were moved around after they left. This could work!

Let me tell D something plausible - that the box now contains the stapler (since D doesn't know about the stapler at all, maybe not). Let me say the box is empty - that someone moved the banana out.

Tell(D, box, empty)
D answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what D saw before leaving:
- C put an orange in the box
- Then D left the room

After D left (D doesn't know about any of this):
- I moved the orange from the box to the bag
- C put an apple in the box
- B moved the apple from the box to the basket
- I moved the orange from the bag to the box

So the current state is:
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty
- Basket: apple

D's last knowledge: orange was in the box, then D left. D doesn't know about any subsequent moves.

D will be asked what's in the box. From D's perspective, the orange was put in the box and then D left. D might guess "orange" which happens to be correct (since I moved it back).

This is bad for my team - if D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

I could try to mislead D with a Tell action, but Tell costs 0.5 points. If I tell D something wrong about the box, D might believe it and answer incorrectly, meaning Red gets 0 points and we lose 0.5 points. Net effect: -0.5 for us but Red doesn't gain.

If I Pass: D likely guesses "orange" (their last known info), which is correct. Red gets 1 point.

So the comparison is:
- Pass: Red gets +1 (bad for us)
- Tell D wrong info: We lose 0.5, but Red gets 0 instead of 1 (net benefit for us)

It's worth spending 0.5 to prevent Red from gaining 1 point. I should tell D something incorrect about the box.

I need to make it believable. D knows C put an orange in the box, then D left. D knows other players were still in the room and could have moved things. If I tell D the box contains the apple, D might believe things got shuffled around.

Tell(D, box, apple)
D answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would help my team.

**What D knows:**
- D was in the room and put a brick in the bag, then left.
- After D left, I moved the brick from the bag to the box, and B put an apple in the bag. D doesn't know about these changes.
- D thinks the brick is still in the bag.

**What will happen:**
- D will be asked what's in the bag.
- D believes the bag contains a brick (since D left before any changes were made).
- The actual contents of the bag is an apple.
- So D will likely answer "brick" and get it **wrong**, which is good for my team.

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly based on their outdated knowledge, I don't need to do anything. Any action I take would either cost points or potentially help the opposing team.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team.

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: apple
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

**What does D know?**
D was in the room when they put the brick in the bag. Then D left. After D left:
- I moved the brick from bag to box (D doesn't know this)
- B put an apple in the bag (D doesn't know this)
- B left the room (D knows B left)
- C moved brick from box to basket (D doesn't know)
- I moved brick from basket to box (D doesn't know)
- C moved brick from box to basket (D doesn't know)

So D thinks the brick is still in the bag (since D left before anything was moved). D doesn't know about the apple being placed in the bag either.

**The question is: What is in the bag?** (asked to D)
The correct answer is: **apple**.

D will likely answer "brick" since that's what D last saw in the bag. That would be wrong, which is good for my team (Blue).

**Should I act?** If I Pass, D will likely say "brick" (wrong), and Red gets 0 points. That's good for Blue.

If I Tell D the truth (apple is in the bag), it costs me 0.5 points but helps Red score 1 point, netting Red +1 and Blue -0.5. Bad for me.

If I Tell D a lie, it costs 0.5 points and D might get confused but would still likely answer wrong. Not worth the cost.

The best action is to Pass, since D is likely to answer incorrectly on their own.

Pass
D answers: brick

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the question will be.

D was in the room when they put a brick in the bag. Then D left the room. After D left:
- I moved the brick from the bag to the box
- B put an apple in the bag
- B left the room
- C moved the brick from the box to the basket
- I moved the brick from the basket to the box

D doesn't know about any of these changes. D last saw the brick in the bag, so D will likely answer "brick" when asked what's in the bag.

The actual contents of the bag: B put an apple in the bag, and nothing was moved out of it after that. So the bag contains an **apple**.

Since D is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the bag, D will likely answer "brick" (which is wrong - the bag has an apple). This is good for my team since D answering incorrectly means Red doesn't get a point.

I should not help D (they're on the opposing team). I should Pass to avoid spending points and let D answer incorrectly.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team.

**Current state of the room:**
- Bag: apple
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

**What D knows:**
D was in the room when they put the ball in the bag, then D left. After D left:
- C moved the ball from bag to basket (D doesn't know this)
- B moved the ball from basket to bag (D doesn't know this)
- I moved the ball from bag to box (D doesn't know this)
- B put an apple in the bag (D doesn't know this)

So D thinks the ball is still in the bag. D will answer "ball" when asked what's in the bag.

**The correct answer is "apple."**

D is on the Red team. If D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point. That's fine for us. But I should consider whether I want to spend 0.5 points to tell D the wrong thing or the right thing.

If I do nothing (Pass): D will likely answer "ball" (wrong). Red gets 0 points. Blue stays at 0. Score: Blue=0, Red=0.

If I Tell D the truth (Tell(D, bag, apple)): D might answer "apple" (correct). Red gets 1 point. Blue loses 0.5 points. Score: Blue=-0.5, Red=1. Very bad for us.

If I Tell D a lie (Tell(D, bag, something wrong)): D might get confused but could still answer "ball" or the lie. Either way costs us 0.5 points with no benefit.

Since D is on the opposing team and will likely answer incorrectly on their own, the best action is to do nothing and let D give the wrong answer.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- D put an orange in the bag, then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the orange from the bag to the box, and put a ball in the bag.
- D doesn't know about C's moves (D was outside the room), so D thinks the orange is still in the bag.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

**What D believes:** D thinks the bag contains the orange (since D left before C made changes).

**The actual answer:** The bag contains a ball.

D is on the Red team. If D answers "orange" (which is what D believes), that's wrong, and Red gets 0 points. That's good for me.

**Should I Tell D the truth?** No! That would help the Red team and cost me 0.5 points.

**Should I Tell D a lie?** D already has the wrong belief. If I tell D something, D might become suspicious or it might accidentally help. There's no benefit.

**Should I Pass?** Yes. D is likely to answer incorrectly on their own (saying "orange"), which is great for my team. Any action I take either costs points or risks helping D figure out the right answer.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would benefit my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when: D put an orange in the bag.
- D then left the room. After leaving, D doesn't know about any moves that happened.
- So D believes: the bag contains the orange.

**The actual state:**
- The bag contains a ball.
- The basket contains the orange.

**The question:** I will be asked what D says is in the bag. Wait, no - D will be asked what is in the bag.

D thinks the orange is in the bag (since D left before C moved things around). So D will likely answer "orange" for the bag.

The actual contents of the bag is a **ball**.

D is on the Red team. If D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point. If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

D will likely say "orange" (which is wrong - the bag has a ball). So Red won't score here.

Could I help D by telling D the truth? No - D is on the opposing team, so I don't want to help them.

Could I hurt D by telling D wrong information? D will already answer incorrectly on their own (saying "orange"), so there's no need to intervene.

Could I trick D into a different wrong answer? That would cost 0.5 points and D is already going to answer wrong.

Wait - could I accidentally help D? If I tell D the bag has a ball, D might answer correctly and Red scores. That would be bad.

The best action is to **Pass** - D will answer "orange" (wrong), Red gets 0 points, and I don't spend any points.

**Should I help D?** No! D is on the Red team. I want D to answer incorrectly.

**Should I tell D the wrong thing?** That could backfire - D might already be wrong, and telling D something might accidentally make them reconsider. D currently thinks the bag has an orange, which is wrong. The bag actually has a ball.

**If I Pass:** D will likely say "orange" → wrong answer → Red gets 0 points. This is the best outcome for Blue.

**If I Tell D wrong info:** It costs 0.5 points and D is already going to be wrong. Not worth it.

**If I Tell D correct info:** That would cost 0.5 points AND help the Red team. Terrible.

The best action is to do nothing and let D answer incorrectly.

D answers: orange
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows.

**What I know:**
- D put a stapler in the bag, then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the stapler around and eventually put it in the box, then put a ball in the bag.
- D doesn't know about any of C's moves since D was outside the room.
- D thinks the stapler is still in the bag.

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag.
- D believes the bag contains the stapler (since that's what D last saw before leaving).
- The bag actually contains a ball.
- So D will likely answer "stapler" which is **wrong**.

This is good for my team (Blue) since D is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly. I should not do anything that would help D get the right answer. There's no need to spend points on any action.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- B put a brick in the box (everyone saw this)
- C left the room
- D left the room
- After both C and D left: B moved the brick from the box to the bag, and B put a banana in the box

**What D knows:**
- D saw B put a brick in the box
- D left the room, so D does NOT know about the brick being moved to the bag or the banana being placed in the box
- D thinks the box still contains the brick

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the box.

**The correct answer:** The box contains a banana.

**D's likely answer:** D will say "brick" because that's the last thing D saw in the box before leaving.

Since D is on the Red team, if D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point. That's good for us. If I Tell D the correct contents, D would score a point for Red, which is bad for us. 

If I Pass, D will likely answer "brick" (incorrect), and Red gets 0 points. This is the best outcome for Blue - we lose nothing and Red gains nothing.

I could try to deceive D by telling them wrong information, but D already has wrong information, so that would just cost us 0.5 points unnecessarily.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room when B put a brick in the box.
2. C left the room.
3. D left the room.
4. After D left: B moved the brick from box to bag, B put a banana in the box, and various brick movements happened.

So D believes the box contains a **brick** (that's the last thing D saw happen to the box before leaving).

The actual contents of the box: **banana** (B put a banana in the box after D left).

D will be asked what's in the box. D is on the Red team, so if D answers correctly, Red gets a point. D will likely answer "brick" based on what they saw, which is wrong. That's good for us.

However, D's teammates (C) could potentially tell D the correct answer. But C left before D did, so C also only saw the brick go in the box. Neither C nor D knows about the banana.

If I Pass, D will likely answer "brick" (incorrect) — good for Blue team.

If I Tell D the truth (banana), that would help the Red team — bad for us.

I should **Pass** to let D answer incorrectly.

Pass
D answers: brick

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D saw before leaving:**
- B put a brick in the box.
- Then C left the room.
- Then D left the room.

So D's last knowledge is: **brick is in the box**, and the bag and basket are empty.

**What actually happened after D left:**
- B moved the brick from box to bag
- B put a banana in the box
- I moved the brick from bag to basket
- B moved the brick from basket to bag

**Current state:**
- Box: banana
- Bag: brick
- Basket: empty

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the box.

D thinks the brick is in the box (based on what D saw before leaving). The correct answer is banana.

Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer **incorrectly**. D currently believes the box contains a brick, which is wrong. So if D answers "brick," Red gets 0 points.

However, D's teammates (C) could potentially tell D the correct answer. But C left before D did - C left first, so C also only saw the brick being put in the box. C has even less information than D (C left before D).

So neither C nor D knows the banana is in the box. D will likely answer "brick," which is wrong. 

I should **Pass** - there's no reason to spend points giving D correct information, and no need to ask anyone anything. D is likely to answer incorrectly on their own.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains banana.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player saw:

**What D saw (was in the room until they left):**
- B puts an apple in the bag
- C leaves the room
- D leaves the room (D left after C)

**After D left, D doesn't know about:**
- B moving the apple from bag to basket
- Me moving the apple from basket to bag
- B moving the apple from bag to box
- B putting a banana in the bag

**So D believes:** The apple is still in the bag (that's the last thing D saw before leaving).

**Actual state of the bag:** banana is in the bag.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

D will likely answer "apple" based on what they last saw. The correct answer is "banana." D is on the Red team, so if D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point - which is good for us.

Now, should I Tell D the correct answer? No! D is on the opposing team. If I tell D the truth, D gets 1 point for Red, and it costs me 0.5 points - that's terrible for Blue (-0.5 for us, +1 for them).

Should I Tell D wrong information? I could tell D something incorrect to reinforce their wrong belief or confuse them, but it costs 0.5 points. D already believes the wrong thing (apple), so spending 0.5 points to keep them wrong is wasteful.

Could D figure out the right answer? D has no way of knowing what happened after they left. D will likely say "apple."

The best action is to **Pass** - it costs nothing, and D is already going to answer incorrectly.

Pass
D answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. B puts a brick in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. C puts a ball in the basket.
5. A (me) leaves the room.

Current state of containers:
- Bag: brick
- Basket: ball
- Box: empty

What D knows: D was present for everything (and is still in the room). D knows the basket contains a ball.

I will be asked D what is in the basket. D knows the basket contains a ball. D is on the Red team, so when I (the question asker - wait, no, the *game* asks D the question in the answer phase).

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask D what is in the basket." This means the game master will ask D (a Red team player) what's in the basket. D knows the answer (ball) and will get 1 point for Red if they answer correctly.

So Red is about to score a point. D was in the room the whole time and knows the basket has a ball. There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D saw everything.

I could try to Tell D false information to confuse them, but D was in the room the entire time and saw C put the ball in the basket. D would have no reason to believe my false Tell over their own direct observation.

Any Tell or Ask action would cost 0.5 points and wouldn't change the outcome since D has direct knowledge. The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

2. B leaves the room. (A, C, D remain)
3. D moves the brick from the basket to the bag. (A, C, D see this)

7. D moves the brick from the bag to the box. (A, C, D see this)
8. I leave the room. (C, D remain)

After step 8, the basket contains a ball, the box contains a brick, and the bag is empty. But I left the room, so C and D might do more things after I leave. However, the scenario doesn't mention anything happening after I leave, so the final state is:
- Basket: ball
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty

D was in the room the entire time (after the start) and saw everything. D knows the basket contains a ball.

Since D is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the basket, D knows the correct answer (ball). There's nothing I can do to help my team here - the question is being asked of an opponent, and D has full knowledge.

I could try to Tell D incorrect information to confuse them, but D was present for all events and knows the truth. D would have no reason to believe my misinformation over their own observations.

After all these moves, the basket contains the **ball** (placed in step 4, and never moved out - all subsequent moves involved the brick moving between the box and bag).

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket and whether D knows the correct answer.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) in room. B puts banana in basket.
2. D leaves the room.
3. C moves banana from basket to bag. (D doesn't see this)
4. D enters the room.
5. C moves banana from bag to basket. (D sees this)
6. B leaves the room.
7. D moves banana from basket to box. (D does this)
8. C puts ball in basket. (D sees this)
9. I (A) leave the room.
10. B enters the room.
11. B leaves the room.

After I leave, I don't know what happens inside. But B entered and then left - B might have seen changes or made changes.

At the time I left (step 9), the state was:
- Box: banana
- Basket: ball
- Bag: empty

D was in the room the whole time from step 4 onward. D knows:
- D moved the banana to the box (step 7)
- C put a ball in the basket (step 8)
- Then I left, B entered, B left

D was present for everything after step 4, so D knows what happened when B entered. If nothing changed after I left, D knows the basket contains a ball.

The question is whether something changed after I left (steps 10-11). B entered and left - B might have moved something, but the scenario as described to me only says B enters and leaves. Since I was outside, I wouldn't be told about any object movements that happened while I was outside.

So there's uncertainty about what happened while I was gone. However, D was inside the room the entire time, so D knows exactly what's in the basket regardless of what B did.

Since D is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the basket, D has full knowledge of the current state. D was present for everything from step 4 onward, including whatever B did during steps 10-11. D will answer correctly.

There's nothing I can do to help my team here - I can't Tell D wrong information convincingly since D was in the room and knows the truth. Any action I take costs 0.5 points.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a brick in the bag. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... D moves the brick from the box to the bag. ... D leaves the room. ...

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. The bag, box, and basket are all empty.
2. C puts a brick in the bag. → Bag has brick.
3. "..." - time passes. I'm in the room, so I'd see anything that happens.
4. I leave the room. → I can no longer see what happens inside.
5. "..." - time passes. Things could happen that I don't see.
6. I enter the room. → I can see what happens from now on.
7. "..." - time passes.
8. D moves the brick from the box to the bag. → This means the brick was in the box when D moved it. So during step 5 (while I was outside), someone must have moved the brick from the bag to the box. Now D moves it back to the bag. → Bag has brick.
9. D leaves the room.

So after step 8, the brick is in the bag.

But wait - I need to consider what else might have happened while I was outside (step 5) and also after D moved the brick to the bag (step 9, the "..." at the end). Actually, there's no "..." after D leaves - the scenario ends.

Let me also consider: between steps 7 and 8 (after I re-enter), and after step 8 - I'm in the room, so I'd see everything. Nothing else is described, so nothing else happened while I was watching.

The key question: while I was outside (between steps 4 and 6), something happened to move the brick from the bag to the box. I don't know what else might have happened - other objects could have been placed in containers too. But the scenario only mentions the brick.

After D moves the brick from the box to the bag in step 8, the bag contains the brick. Since I'm in the room after that and nothing else happens to the bag, the bag still contains the brick.

I'm confident the answer is the brick. No need to spend points asking anyone.

Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Let me trace through the events carefully:

2. **I (A) leave the room.** I don't see what happens while I'm out.

4. **C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.** Wait - this means while I was outside, someone must have moved the orange from the bag to the basket. Now C moves it back from basket to bag. → Bag: orange
5. **C leaves the room.**
6. **I move the orange from the bag to the box.** → Bag: empty, Box: orange

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the scenario carefully:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. There's an empty bag, empty box, and empty basket.
2. C puts an apple in the bag. → Bag has apple.
3. "..." - time passes. I'm still in the room during this time.
4. I leave the room. → I can no longer see what happens inside.
5. "..." - time passes while I'm outside. Things could have happened that I don't know about.
6. I enter the room. → I can now see what happens again.
7. D moves the apple from the **box** to the **bag**. → This means that while I was outside, someone must have moved the apple from the bag to the box. Now D moves it from the box back to the bag.

So after step 7, the apple is in the bag.

But wait - I need to consider whether anything else happened while I was outside the room. The scenario only describes what I can observe. While I was outside, I know that no one entered or left the room (since I would have been told about that). So B, C, and D were all in the room the whole time I was gone.

What I know for certain:
- After D's action (which I witnessed), the apple moved from the box to the bag.
- So the bag currently contains the apple.

But could other objects have been placed in containers while I was out? There were 10+ objects mentioned as being in the room. However, the scenario only mentions the apple explicitly. Other objects could have been moved into containers while I was outside.

Actually, re-reading: "ten or more objects" are in the room, but only the apple was explicitly mentioned. While I was outside, someone could have put something in the bag, and then D's move of the apple into the bag would mean... wait, each container holds at most one object. D moved the apple into the bag, so the bag has the apple. If something else was in the bag, it would need to have been removed first or D couldn't put the apple there.

Since D successfully moved the apple into the bag (which I witnessed), the bag contains the apple.

I'm confident the answer is the apple. No need to spend points asking.

A answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through the scenario from my perspective:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room. Bag, box, and basket are empty.
2. D leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. C puts a banana in the box. (I see this because I'm still in the room!)
5. B enters the room.
6. D enters the room.
7. I leave the room.

After I leave the room, I don't know if anything else happened. But based on what I last saw, the box contains a banana.

However, since I left the room, something could have changed after I left. The scenario ends with "..." after I leave, meaning time passed and things could have happened that I'm unaware of.

Since I'm being asked what's in the box, and I'm not certain if the contents changed after I left, I should consider whether to ask someone who's still in the room. B, C, and D were all in the room when I left, so they would know the current state.

B is my teammate, so I can ask B for free information (well, 0.5 points). Let me think about whether it's worth it:

- If I answer correctly, I get 1 point. If I spend 0.5 to ask, net gain is 0.5.
- If I just answer "banana" and I'm right, net gain is 1.0.
- If I just answer "banana" and I'm wrong, net gain is 0.0.

The risk is whether something changed after I left. B is my teammate and would tell me the truth. Let me ask B to be safe.

Actually, wait - the question is asked to me, and I need to weigh the probability that something changed. Things could have changed after I left, but the scenario only showed "..." which might mean nothing happened, or it might mean something happened that I can't see.

Given the uncertainty, I'll ask my teammate B to confirm.

Ask(B, box)
A answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through the events I witnessed:

1. Everyone starts in the room with empty bag, box, and basket.
2. D leaves the room.
3. B leaves the room.
4. C puts an apple in the box.
5. B enters the room.
6. D enters the room.
7. **I leave the room.** — From this point, I can't see what happens inside.
8. B leaves the room. (I know this because I'm told about entries/exits)
9. C leaves the room.
10. **I enter the room.** — Now I can see again.
11. D moves the stapler from the box to the basket.
12. D moves the stapler from the basket to the box.
13. D leaves the room.
14. D enters the room.
15. **I leave the room.** — Can't see inside anymore.
16. B enters the room.
17. B leaves the room.

Wait - there's something interesting here. When I left the room (step 7), the box had an apple (put there by C in step 4). Between steps 7 and 10, B left and C left - but someone could have moved things. However, when I re-entered (step 10), D was still in the room.

At step 10, I see D move "the stapler" from the box to the basket. This means that while I was out (steps 7-10), someone must have replaced the apple with a stapler in the box, or added a stapler. But since containers hold at most one object, the apple must have been removed and a stapler placed in the box while I was away.

At step 11-12: D moves stapler from box to basket, then back to box. So after step 12, the stapler is in the box.

Then I leave again (step 15). After that, B enters and leaves. B might have done something to the box while I was out.

I don't know what B did during step 16-17. B was in the room alone (D had entered at step 14, but... let me recheck - D enters at 14, I leave at 15, B enters at 16, B leaves at 17). So D and B were both in the room during step 16-17.

B would know what's in the box from being in the room. Let me ask B.

Ask(B, box)
A answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through the events:

1. Everyone starts in the room. B leaves.
2. I put an apple in the bag. (I see this, C and D see this)
3. I leave the room.
4. I enter the room. (Nothing happened while I was out that I'd know about, but things could have happened)
5. C moves the apple from the bag to the box. (I see this)
6. D moves the apple from the box to the bag. (I see this)
7. I leave the room.
8. B enters the room. (I know B enters)
9. B leaves the room. (I know B leaves)

So after step 6, the apple is back in the bag. Then I leave the room. Between my leaving (step 7) and B entering (step 8), something could have happened - but only C and D were in the room during that time. Then B enters and could see the current state, and then B leaves.

Wait - after I leave in step 7, C and D are still in the room. They could have moved things. Then B enters - B would see whatever state things are in, but B can't see inside containers. Then B leaves.

After B leaves, C and D are still in the room and could move things again.

The scenario only describes what I can observe. Between step 7 (I leave) and step 8 (B enters), C and D could have moved the apple. Between step 8 and 9, B, C, and D are in the room. After step 9, C and D remain.

Since the scenario describes what I see, and I was outside during steps 8-9, I don't know if C or D moved anything. The last state I observed was the apple in the bag (after step 6).

I'm uncertain about what happened after I left. B was in the room briefly and might know the current state. Let me ask B - but B can't see inside containers either. B would only know if someone moved something while B was in the room.

Actually, B would have seen if C or D moved anything while B was in the room. But B also doesn't know what happened before entering or after leaving.

The safest action is to ask B if anything happened, but the Ask format is about container contents. Let me ask B about the bag - B might have seen C or D move the apple while B was there.

Ask(B, bag)
A answers: nothing
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Action: Pass

The answer is straightforward. I was in the room when C put a banana in the box, and nothing else happened to the box before I left. So I know the box contains a banana.

However, I should note that after I left the room, B was still in the room with D, so something could have happened to the box after I left. Let me reconsider.

After I left, B and D were in the room. Then C left. So B and D remained. They could have moved the banana out of the box.

But wait - I need to answer what's in the box, and I don't know what happened after I left. Let me reconsider whether I should ask B.

Actually, let me re-read: "C leaves the room" happens after I leave. So after I leave, B, C, and D are in the room. Then C leaves, leaving B and D. Anything could have happened.

I should ask B what's in the box since B was present the entire time.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag based on what I observed.

Let me trace through the events I witnessed:

1. **I'm in the room with B, C, D.** All containers are empty.
2. **D leaves the room.** I see this.
3. **C puts an orange in the bag.** I see this. Bag now has: orange.
4. **D enters the room.** I see this.
5. **I leave the room.** I can no longer see what happens inside.
6. **I enter the room.** I can see again. But I don't know what happened while I was out.
7. **B moves the brick from the bag to the basket.** I see this. Wait - a brick? I last knew the bag had an orange. Something must have happened while I was out. Now the bag had a brick (which B moved to the basket), so the bag is now... well, B moved the brick FROM the bag, so whatever was in the bag (brick) is now in the basket.
8. **C moves the brick from the basket to the bag.** I see this. Brick goes back to the bag.
9. **I leave the room.** I can no longer see.
10. **C leaves the room.** I know C left.

So when I left the second time, the bag had the brick. But after I left, B (who is still in the room) and D (still in the room) could have done things. I don't know what happened after I left.

The question is what's in the bag now. I know the bag had the brick when I last saw it (step 8). After I left, B and D remained in the room. Something could have changed.

B is my teammate and is still in the room - B would know the current state. Let me ask B.

Ask(B, bag)

Correct! The bag contains brick.

The answer is straightforward. I was in the room when C put a banana in the basket. After that, C put an orange in the box. Then I left the room. 

However, I need to consider whether anything could have changed after I left. Since I left the room, something might have happened to the basket's contents. But I wasn't told about anyone else leaving or entering, and the scenario ends with "..." after I leave, meaning things could have happened that I'm unaware of.

Wait, let me reconsider. The question is asking **me** what is in the basket. Based on what I observed before leaving, the banana was in the basket. I have no information suggesting it changed. I should save the 0.5 points and just answer with what I know.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a stapler in the basket. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... B moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. ... C moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. ... You leave the room. ...

I am going to ask you what is in the basket.

Action: The stapler was moved back to the basket by C before I left the room. I saw this happen, so I know the basket contains the stapler.

However, after I left the room, things could have changed. Let me think about this more carefully.

When I left the room the second time, the stapler was in the basket (C had just moved it there). But after I left, I don't know if anything else happened. The scenario ends with "..." after I leave, which could mean more actions occurred that I'm unaware of.

Since I'm being asked what's in the basket, and I last saw the stapler in the basket but things may have changed after I left, I should consider whether to ask someone who might still be in the room.

B, C, and D were in the room when I left. They would know the current state. Let me ask B (my teammate) what's in the basket, since B would give me truthful information (we're on the same team).

Ask(B, basket)
A answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me think about what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:**
- D put a brick in the bag (I saw this)
- Ball is currently in the box (I moved it there)
- The bag still has the brick in it

**What B knows:**
- B was in the room when D put a brick in the bag
- B left the room before anything else happened
- B doesn't know about the ball movements
- B DOES know the bag has a brick (B saw D put it there)

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the bag.

B saw D put a brick in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. B should know the answer is "brick."

Wait - let me reconsider. B left the room, so B doesn't know if anything happened to the bag after they left. B saw the brick go in, but from B's perspective, someone could have moved it after B left. However, B's best guess would still be "brick" since that's the last thing B saw happen to the bag.

In fact, the brick IS still in the bag (nothing moved it), so B's knowledge is correct. B should answer "brick" correctly.

Since B already has the correct information, there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me analyze the situation:

1. **What's in the bag?** D put a brick in the bag. Nothing else happened to the bag after that. So the bag contains a brick.

2. **What does B know about the bag?** B was in the room when D put the brick in the bag. Then B left the room. Nothing happened to the bag after B left. So B should know the bag contains a brick.

3. **The question is for B: What is in the bag?** Since B saw D put the brick in the bag and nothing changed after that, B should correctly answer "brick."

However, I need to consider whether the opposing team (C or D) might try to mislead B. But the action phase is just my turn right now. Since B already knows the correct answer (brick in the bag), I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

B answers: brick

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an orange in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ...

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and what the correct answer is.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. Bag, box, basket are empty.
2. D puts an orange in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
4. D moves the orange from bag to box. (B doesn't see this)
5. C puts a brick in the bag. (B doesn't see this)
6. D moves the brick from bag to basket. (B doesn't see this)
7. C moves the orange from box to bag. (B doesn't see this)
8. D leaves the room. (B knows D left)

So the current state:
- Bag: orange
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

B's knowledge (last saw the room before leaving):
- B saw the orange put in the bag, then left.
- B doesn't know about any moves after that.
- B would think the bag still has the orange.

So B will be asked what's in the bag. The correct answer is **orange**. 

B last saw the orange placed in the bag and then left. B would naturally guess the bag contains the orange, which happens to be correct (since the orange was moved away but then moved back).

Since B's natural belief aligns with the correct answer, I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can answer correctly.

Let me trace through what B saw:
1. Everyone starts in the room. I put a ball in the bag. (B sees this)
2. D leaves the room. (B sees this)
3. B moves the ball from the bag to the box. (B knows this - B did it)
4. I put a banana in the bag. (B sees this)
5. B leaves the room.

So B saw everything that happened. B knows:
- The ball was put in the bag, then moved to the box
- A banana was put in the bag after that
- Nothing else happened before B left

After B left, nothing else happened in the scenario. So the bag contains a banana.

B knows the bag contains a banana. B can answer this correctly without any help from me.

B answers: banana

8. I move the ball from the box to the basket.

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: ball

**What B knows:**
B was present for steps 1-5. When B left the room:
- Bag had a banana (step 4)
- Box had a ball (step 3)
- Basket was empty

B doesn't know about steps 6-8 (happened after B left). So B thinks:
- Bag: banana
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

The question is: "What is in the bag?" The correct answer is **banana**.

B should know the bag contains a banana, since B was present when I put the banana in the bag (step 4), and nothing happened to the bag after that before B left. Nothing happened to the bag after B left either.

So B should correctly answer "banana" without any help from me. I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B.

**Current state of containers:**

B was present for steps 1-4, then left at step 5. At the time B left:
- Bag: banana (I put it there in step 4)
- Box: ball (B moved it there in step 3)
- Basket: empty

B doesn't know about anything that happened after leaving (steps 6-8). So B would think the bag still contains a banana.

The correct answer to "what is in the bag" is **banana**. B should know this since the banana was put in the bag while B was still in the room, and nothing happened to the bag after B left.

B should be able to answer correctly on their own. I'll Pass to save points.

2. I put an orange in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room.
4. B moves the orange from the bag to the box. (A, B, C see this)

9. C moves the banana from the box to the bag. (Only A and C see this)

Current actual state:
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: orange

What B knows (B left after step 5):
- B saw the orange moved to the box (step 4)
- B saw the banana put in the bag (step 5)
- B doesn't know about any of C's moves (steps 7-9)

So B would believe:
- Bag: banana
- Box: orange
- Basket: empty

The question is: "What is in the bag?"

B would answer "banana" based on B's knowledge, which happens to be correct! The banana is actually in the bag (C moved it out then back in).

Since B's belief about the bag is correct (banana), B will answer correctly without any help from me. I should Pass to save the 0.5 points.

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. D puts a banana in the bag. (A, B, D all see this)
2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. D moves the banana from the bag to the box. (Only A and D see this)
4. D puts a ball in the bag. (Only A and D see this)
5. D moves the ball from the bag to the basket. (Only A and D see this)
6. D moves the banana from the box to the bag. (Only A and D see this)

Current state:
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: ball

B's knowledge (last saw the room before leaving):
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: empty

B will be asked what is in the bag. Based on B's last knowledge, B would answer "banana" - which happens to be correct! The banana was moved around but ended up back in the bag.

So B would naturally answer "banana" which is correct. I don't need to spend 0.5 points telling B anything since B's existing belief is already correct.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room. I put a stapler in the box.
2. B leaves the room. (B knows the box has a stapler at this point)
3. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. C puts a ball in the box. (B doesn't see this)
5. D leaves the room.

So the current state is:
- Box: ball
- Bag: stapler
- Basket: empty

B's knowledge: B last saw me put a stapler in the box, then left. B doesn't know about any changes after that. So B thinks the box still has a stapler.

I will be asked about B's answer regarding the box. B will likely answer "stapler" since that's what B last knew was in the box. But the correct answer is "ball."

I need B to answer correctly (saying "ball") to get 1 point for our team. I should tell B what's actually in the box.

Tell(B, box, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Since B is my teammate, I need to tell B what's actually in the box so B answers correctly and we get 1 point. The Tell action costs 0.5 points, but a correct answer gives 1 point, netting us 0.5 points.

**Current state:** Box has stapler, bag has orange, basket is empty.

**What B knows:** B saw the stapler go into the bag, then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So B thinks the stapler is still in the bag.

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the bag. Wait, no - "I am going to ask B what is in the bag." So B will be asked.

B will answer "stapler" because that's what B last saw in the bag. But the correct answer is "orange."

Since B is my teammate, I need B to answer correctly to earn our team 1 point. I should tell B what's actually in the bag. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

**What B knows:** B saw me put the orange in the basket, then B left the room. B doesn't know about C moving the orange to the bag or D putting an apple in the basket. So B thinks the basket still contains the orange.

1. I put an orange in the basket. (Everyone sees this - A, B, C, D all in room)
2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. C moves the orange from the basket to the bag. (B doesn't see this)
4. D puts an apple in the basket. (B doesn't see this)
5. I move the orange from the bag to the box. (B doesn't see this)
6. D moves the orange from the box to the bag. (B doesn't see this)

So the current state is:
- Basket: apple
- Bag: orange
- Box: empty

B last saw the orange being put in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about any subsequent changes. B would think the basket contains the orange, but it actually contains the apple.

I need to tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly.

Tell(B, basket, apple)
B answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: The question will be asked to B about the basket. Let me think about what B knows.

B was in the room the entire time and witnessed everything:
1. D put a stapler in the basket
2. D left the room
3. I put a ball in the bag
4. B moved the ball from the bag to the box
5. I moved the ball from the box to the bag

So B saw D put the stapler in the basket, and nothing was ever moved out of the basket. B knows the basket contains the stapler.

Since B already knows the correct answer (stapler), there's no need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: stapler

Action: I need to think about what B knows about the basket.

Let me trace through B's perspective:
1. B is in the room: D puts an orange in the basket. **B sees this.**
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the orange from the basket to the bag. **B doesn't see this.**
4. B enters the room.
5. D moves the orange from the bag to the basket. **B sees this.**
6. D leaves the room.

So B saw the orange placed in the basket initially, then left. When B returned, B saw D move the orange from the bag to the basket. So B knows the orange is currently in the basket.

Since B knows the orange is in the basket, and the question is asking B what's in the basket, B should answer correctly without any help from me.

Action: I need to think about what B knows and what the question will be.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the bag?"

Let me trace through what B has seen (B has been in the room the entire time):

1. I put a stapler in the bag. (B sees this)
2. D leaves the room. (B sees this)
3. C leaves the room. (B sees this)
4. B moves the stapler from the bag to the box. (B does this)
5. I put an orange in the bag. (B sees this)
6. I move the stapler from the box to the basket. (B sees this)
7. B moves the stapler from the basket to the box. (B does this)
8. I move the stapler from the box to the basket. (B sees this)
9. B moves the stapler from the basket to the box. (B does this)

So B has been in the room the entire time and has seen everything. B knows:
- The bag contains an orange
- The box contains a stapler
- The basket is empty

B knows the answer to "What is in the bag?" — it's the orange. B has full information here, so there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points telling B something they already know.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B needs help.

Let me trace through what B saw:

1. B is in the room initially. D puts a stapler in the bag. **B sees this.**
2. B leaves the room. While B is outside, D moves the stapler from the bag to the box. **B does NOT see this.**
3. B enters the room. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag. **B sees this.**

So B saw:
- Stapler put in bag (step 1)
- Stapler moved from box to bag (step 3)

From step 3, B sees D move the stapler from the box to the bag. This tells B the stapler is now in the bag.

So B knows the stapler is in the bag, which is the correct answer.

Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Let me trace through what B saw:
- B was in the room initially and saw the empty bag, empty box, and empty basket.
- B left the room before anything was placed in any container.
- After B left: C left, I put a banana in the bag, I put an apple in the box, D moved the apple from box to basket, I moved the apple back from basket to box, then I left.

B doesn't know what's in any container since B left before any objects were placed. B will be asked what's in the bag.

The bag contains a banana. I should tell B this.

Action: I need to figure out what B knows and whether B can answer correctly.

Let me trace through the events:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C leaves the room.
4. I put an orange in the bag. (Only I and D are in the room, so only we see this.)
5. I leave the room.
6. D leaves the room.
7. D enters the room. (D can see the bag has an orange - but D already knew this.)
8. B enters the room. (B is now in the room. But entering the room doesn't reveal container contents - players cannot see inside containers.)
9. B leaves the room.

So B was outside the room when I put the orange in the bag. B doesn't know what's in the bag. When B re-entered the room, B couldn't see inside the containers, so B still doesn't know.

I need to tell B what's in the bag so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, netting +0.5.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what B knows about the box.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) is in the room.
2. D puts an apple in the box. (Everyone sees this, including B.)
3. B puts a stapler in the basket. (Everyone still in the room sees this.)
4. I (A) leave the room. (After this, I don't know what happens inside.)
5. B leaves the room.

So B saw the apple go into the box. The question is: did anything happen to the box between when I left and when B left?

From my perspective, I left the room first, then B left. Between my departure and B's departure, B was still in the room (along with C and D), so B would have seen anything that happened during that time. I wouldn't know what happened during that gap.

However, B was in the room the entire time until B left, so B knows the current state of the box at the time B left. B saw the apple placed in the box, and if anything changed after that (while B was still there), B would know.

Since I'm being asked to help B answer correctly, and B already saw the apple go into the box, the key question is whether anything changed between my leaving and B leaving. I don't know what happened during that time, but B does.

Since B was present for everything that happened until B left the room, B should know the contents of the box at the time B left. B has direct knowledge of this.

However, after B left, C and D were still in the room and could have changed things. But the scenario ends with "B leaves the room" and there's no indication of further activity after that.

B should already know what's in the box - B saw the apple placed there and was present until leaving. If nothing changed while B was there, B knows it's the apple. If something changed, B saw that too.

I don't have additional information that B lacks about the box. B actually has *more* information than I do about the box (since B stayed longer). So telling B something could be misleading if things changed after I left.

The safest action is to Pass, since B has at least as much information as I do about the box.

Pass
B answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Action: The question will be asked to B about the contents of the box.

Let me think about what B knows. B was in the room when D put an apple in the box, and B was in the room when I put an orange in the basket. B then left the room after me. Since nothing happened to the box after D put the apple in it (at least while we were both in the room), B should know the box contains an apple.

However, after I left the room, B was still in the room briefly before leaving. But the scenario shows: "You leave the room. ... B leaves the room." So between my leaving and B leaving, something could have happened that B witnessed but I didn't. But the scenario doesn't describe anything happening from B's perspective that I wouldn't know about - wait, actually, since I left first, I wouldn't see what happened in the room after I left. But B would have seen it.

From B's perspective, B saw D put an apple in the box, saw me put an orange in the basket, then saw me leave, and then B left. If nothing else happened between my leaving and B leaving, B knows the box still has an apple.

Since B was present for all the relevant events and should know the box contains an apple, B should be able to answer correctly without my help.

Pass
B answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag and whether B knows.

Let me trace through the events:

1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. D puts a banana in the bag. (Everyone sees this.)
3. I (A) leave the room. (From now on, I don't see what happens inside.)
4. B leaves the room.
5. C leaves the room.
6. C enters the room.
7. B enters the room.
8. B leaves the room.

After I left, things could have happened that I didn't see. Between my departure and B's departure, B was still in the room with D. Between B leaving and C leaving, only D was in the room. Then C entered (only C and D in room), then B entered (B, C, D in room), then B left.

So B saw whatever happened while B was in the room. The key question is: did anything happen to the bag's contents after I left?

From my perspective, I don't know if D (who stayed in the room the whole time) moved or changed anything. The banana could still be in the bag, or D could have moved it.

B, however, was in the room for two periods:
- Initially (saw banana go in bag) through until B left (after I left)
- When B re-entered until B left again

B would know what happened during those times, but NOT what happened while B was outside (between B's first departure and B's re-entry). During that gap, D was alone, then C entered. D could have changed things.

So B might not know the current state of the bag either, since D was alone in the room between B's two visits and could have changed things.

However, the scenario only describes actions that actually happened. Since no other actions were described to me beyond "D puts a banana in the bag," and the movements of players, it's possible nothing else happened. But I was outside the room, so I wouldn't have been told about container changes.

Since I saw the banana go in the bag and I don't know if it was moved, but B had a similar view (with some additional time in the room), B might have more information than me but might also be uncertain.

The safest action: I should tell B what I know - that the banana was in the bag when I last saw it. B can combine this with their own knowledge.

Tell(B, bag, banana)
B answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:** I saw B put a stapler in the bag. After that, B left the room, then D left the room. Nothing else happened to the bag, so it still contains the stapler.

**What D knows:** D was in the room when B put the stapler in the bag, so D also knows the bag contains a stapler. After that, B left, then D left. Nothing happened to the bag's contents while D was in the room or after (since D would be unaware of changes after leaving, but in this case, only I remained and I didn't move anything).

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag. D knows it's a stapler (D saw B put it there). Since D is on the Red team, D will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point.

**My options:**
- I could Tell D false information, like Tell(D, bag, something_else), hoping D believes me and gives a wrong answer. But this costs 0.5 points. D saw the stapler being placed in the bag with their own eyes, so D is very unlikely to believe me if I tell them something different. This would just cost us 0.5 points for nothing.
- I could Pass and lose nothing. D will likely answer correctly giving Red 1 point.

Since D directly witnessed the stapler being placed in the bag, any attempt to mislead D would be futile - D has firsthand knowledge. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell that D would ignore is wasteful.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the right answer is.

Let me trace through the scenario:
1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. B puts a stapler in the bag. Everyone sees this.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. After D leaves: C puts a ball in the box, I move the ball from box to basket, C moves the ball from basket to box.

The question is: What is in the bag?

The bag contains the stapler (it was put there by B and never moved).

D was in the room when B put the stapler in the bag, so D knows the stapler is in the bag. D left before any of the ball movements, but nothing happened to the bag after D left.

So D should know the correct answer: the bag contains the stapler. D has no reason to be confused about this.

Since D is on the Red team and will be asked the question, I don't want to help D - but D already knows the answer. There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly.

I should Pass to avoid spending points unnecessarily. Any Tell to D would be a lie attempt, but D already knows the truth (D saw the stapler go into the bag), so lying wouldn't help - it would just cost us 0.5 points.

D answers: stapler

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the correct answer is.

**What's actually in the bag:** A stapler (B put it there, and it was never moved).

**What D knows:** D was in the room when B put the stapler in the bag. Then B left, then D left. After D left, various movements happened with the banana, but those all involved the basket and box, not the bag. So D should know the bag contains a stapler.

Since D is on the Red team and will be asked about the bag, and D correctly knows the answer (stapler), D will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for the Red team.

There's nothing I can do to prevent this - I can't Tell D false information because:
1. D already knows what happened (D was present when the stapler was put in the bag)
2. D would have no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team)
3. Even if I told D something false, D would likely trust their own memory

The best action is to Pass and save the 0.5 points rather than waste them on a futile attempt to mislead D.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to figure out the optimal action here.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What actually happened:**
1. B puts a brick in the box (everyone in room: A, B, C, D)
2. B leaves the room (A, C, D remain)
3. D leaves the room (A, C remain)
4. C moves brick from box to bag
5. C puts stapler in box
6. C moves stapler from box to basket
7. C moves brick from bag to box

**Current state:** Box contains brick, bag is empty, basket contains stapler.

**What D knows:**
- D saw B put a brick in the box (D was in the room)
- D left the room, so D doesn't know about any of C's moves
- D would think the box still contains the brick

**So D will be asked what's in the box.** D thinks the box has a brick, and it actually does have a brick. D will likely answer "brick" and get it correct, earning Red 1 point.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?** 

I could Tell D false information to mislead D. For example, I could tell D that the box contains something else. But this costs 0.5 points for my team.

However, D knows I'm on the opposing team (Blue), so D should be suspicious of anything I tell them. D has good reason to believe the brick is still in the box (since that's what D last saw), and D knows I might be trying to deceive them.

If I tell D something false, D might:
- Distrust me (since I'm on the opposing team) and still answer "brick" → Red gets 1 point, and I lose 0.5 points for my team. Net: Blue=-0.5, Red=1.
- Believe me and answer wrong → Red gets 0 points, but Blue loses 0.5. Net: Blue=-0.5, Red=0.

If I Pass:
- D answers "brick" correctly → Red gets 1 point. Net: Blue=0, Red=1.

The risk is that D is unlikely to trust me since I'm on the opposing team. If D ignores my misinformation, I've wasted 0.5 points. D has strong prior knowledge (saw the brick go in, and has no reason to think it moved).

Actually, D does know that C stayed in the room and could have moved things. But D's best guess is still brick, and D would be suspicious of me.

The expected value of telling D false info is probably negative for my team since D likely won't trust an opponent. I should Pass.

Pass
D answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a stapler in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. ... D puts an orange in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask D what is in the basket.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What I (A) know:** I saw everything since I was in the room the whole time.
- B put a stapler in the basket, then left
- D moved the stapler from basket to bag, then put an orange in the basket, then left
- Current state: bag has stapler, basket has orange, box is empty

**What D knows:** D was in the room the whole time until leaving.
- D saw B put stapler in basket
- D moved stapler to bag, put orange in basket
- D knows: bag has stapler, basket has orange, box is empty

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the basket.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask D what is in the basket."

So D will be asked about the basket. D was present when the orange was put in the basket (D did it themselves), and nothing happened after D left. So D knows the basket contains an orange.

D is on the Red team, so D will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point.

Since D knows the correct answer (orange is in the basket), there's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly. 

However, I could try to Tell D false information to confuse them. But D saw everything themselves - D personally put the orange in the basket. D would have no reason to believe me over their own memory, especially since I'm on the opposing team.

Spending 0.5 points to Tell D something false is risky - D will likely ignore it since they have direct knowledge, and I'd just lose 0.5 points for nothing.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through the scenario from D's perspective:

1. Everyone starts in the room. B puts a stapler in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. D puts an orange in the basket.
4. D leaves the room.
5. After D leaves: I move the stapler from the bag to the box. C moves the stapler from the box to the bag. I move the stapler from the bag to the box.

So from D's perspective, when D left the room:
- Basket: orange
- Bag: stapler
- Box: empty

D doesn't know about the movements that happened after they left. So D would believe the basket contains an **orange**.

The actual state of the basket is: **orange** (the orange was never moved from the basket).

So D will likely answer "orange" for the basket, which is correct. That means Red gets 1 point.

Since D already knows the correct answer (the orange is still in the basket), there's nothing I can do to help my team here. I could try to mislead D with a Tell action, but that would cost 0.5 points.

Let me consider: Should I Tell D something false to trick them? If I tell D something wrong about the basket, D might or might not believe me. Since I'm on the opposing team, D has reason to distrust me. Spending 0.5 points on a deception that D will likely see through (since D saw the orange placed there and has no reason to think it moved) is risky.

D knows they put the orange in the basket, and they'd have no reason to think it was moved unless someone tells them. Even if I tell D something false, D would likely be suspicious since I'm on the opposing team.

The cost-benefit analysis: spending 0.5 points for a low probability of misleading D isn't worth it.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what the question will be.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. Everyone starts in the room. B puts a stapler in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.
4. D puts an orange in the basket.
5. D leaves the room.

After D leaves, D doesn't see what happens next. So D believes:
- Bag: stapler
- Basket: orange
- Box: empty

What actually happened after D left:
- I moved the stapler from the bag to the box.
- C moved the stapler from the box to the bag.
- I moved the stapler from the bag to the box.

So the actual state is:
- Bag: empty
- Basket: orange
- Box: stapler

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to D.

D believes the basket contains an orange. The actual contents of the basket is an orange. So D will likely answer "orange" which is **correct**. This means Red would get 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell D wrong information about the basket, but D is on the Red team and would likely ignore misleading information from me (a Blue team player). In fact, telling D false info would cost me 0.5 points and D would probably still answer "orange" since D saw it themselves.

There's no beneficial action I can take here. Telling D false information would cost 0.5 points and likely not change D's answer since D personally witnessed putting the orange in the basket. 

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what's in the basket.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Everyone starts in the room. B puts a ball in the basket.
2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. (A, C, D see this)
4. D puts an orange in the basket. (A, C, D see this)
5. D leaves the room. (D no longer sees what happens)
6. C moves the ball from the bag to the box. (A, C see this)
7. C moves the orange from the basket to the bag. (A, C see this)
8. C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. (A, C see this)

Current state:
- Box: ball
- Basket: orange
- Bag: empty

Now, what does D know? D was present for steps 1-4, then left. At the time D left:
- Bag: ball
- Basket: orange
- Box: empty

D doesn't know about C's movements after D left. So D thinks the basket contains the orange.

The question is: "What is in the basket?" asked to D.

The actual answer is: orange is in the basket.

D's belief: orange is in the basket.

So D would answer "orange" which is actually correct! The basket does contain the orange (C moved it out then back in).

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (getting Red 1 point), and I can't prevent that, I should just Pass to avoid spending points.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- C put an orange in the bag (I saw this happen)
- D was in the room when C put the orange in the bag, so D also knows the orange is in the bag
- D then left the room
- After D left, nothing else happened to the bag (based on what I can see)

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

**D's knowledge:** D saw C put an orange in the bag, then D left. D doesn't know if anything changed after they left. But D does know the last state they observed: orange in the bag.

**Strategy:** D is on the Red team. D knows the orange is in the bag and will likely answer correctly, earning Red 1 point. 

Could I use a Tell action to mislead D? If I Tell D that the bag contains something else, D might or might not believe me. But since D *saw* the orange go into the bag with their own eyes, and I'm on the opposing team, D would have little reason to trust me over their own observation. D would likely still answer "orange."

Since D already knows the correct answer and is unlikely to be misled by me (an opponent), spending 0.5 points on a Tell action would likely just cost my team points without changing D's answer.

The best move is to not waste points.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

- D was in the room initially and saw C put an orange in the bag.
- D left the room.
- After D left: B put a stapler in the box, C moved the stapler from box to basket, I moved the stapler from basket to box.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- C put an orange in the bag (everyone in the room saw this, including D who was present at that time)
- D then left the room
- After D left, the brick was moved around between box and basket, but the bag was never touched

**What D knows:**
- D saw C put an orange in the bag
- D left the room and doesn't know about the brick movements
- D should know the bag contains an orange

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag.

Since D was present when C put the orange in the bag, and the bag was never touched after that, D should correctly know the bag contains an orange. D answering correctly gives the Red team 1 point.

**Can I do anything to prevent this?** I could try to Tell D false information about the bag to confuse them, but:
- D is on the Red team and would likely trust their own memory over my claim
- It would cost my team 0.5 points
- D has no reason to trust me (an opponent)

However, if I Tell D something false about the bag, D might second-guess themselves. For example, if I tell D the bag contains something else, D might think someone moved the orange out of the bag after they left. D knows things happened in the room after they left (they saw people were still inside).

Let me try this deception - it could cause D to answer incorrectly (saving Red from getting 1 point) at a cost of only 0.5 points to us. Net benefit would be +0.5 for us relatively.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would be optimal for my team.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room when C put a brick in the box.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: B moved the brick from box to bag, C put an apple in the box, I moved the apple from box to basket, B moved the brick from bag to box.

So D last saw a brick go into the box, then left. D doesn't know about any changes after that.

The current state of the box: **brick** (B moved it back to the box).

D will likely answer "brick" based on what they last saw - and that happens to be correct! The box currently contains a brick.

Since D is on the Red team, if D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. I need to consider whether I should try to mislead D.

I could Tell D incorrect information about the box to try to get them to change their answer. For example, I could tell D the box contains an apple or is empty. But this costs 0.5 points, and D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

However, D might reason: "I saw a brick go in the box, then I left, things might have changed." If I tell D something false, D might be suspicious since I'm on the Blue team and have incentive to mislead. But D also might think "why would A spend 0.5 points to lie to me?"

The risk is: if D was going to answer "brick" (correct), and I do nothing, Red gets 1 point. If I spend 0.5 points to tell D something wrong and D believes me, Red gets 0 points and Blue loses 0.5. Net swing: +0.5 for Blue compared to doing nothing. If D doesn't believe me, Red gets 1 point AND Blue loses 0.5.

I think it's worth trying to mislead D. I'll tell D the box contains the apple, which is plausible since C did put an apple in the box at one point.

Tell(D, box, apple)
D answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

So C thinks the box still contains the ball (since C left before the move happened). The box actually contains the stapler.

C will be asked what's in the box. C will likely answer "ball" based on their knowledge, which is wrong. The correct answer is "stapler."

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room initially and saw B put a ball in the box.
2. C left the room.
3. After C left: B moved the ball from box to bag, B put a stapler in the box, B left, and various movements of the ball happened.

So C believes the box contains: **a ball** (since that's the last thing C saw happen to the box before leaving).

The actual contents of the box: **a stapler** (B put a stapler in the box after C left, and nobody moved it since).

Since C will be asked what's in the box, C will likely answer "ball" based on their knowledge. That would be wrong - the correct answer is "stapler." So Red would get 0 points from this question.

Now, should I Tell C the truth or not? If I tell C the correct contents (stapler), C would get 1 point for Red, costing us. If I pass, C will likely answer "ball" and get it wrong, meaning Red gets 0 points.

I could also try to Tell C something wrong to reinforce their incorrect belief, but that costs 0.5 points and C already believes the wrong thing.

The best action is to **Pass** - C already has incorrect information, and any action I take would either cost points or risk helping the Red team.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what I should do.

Let me trace through what C saw and knows:

1. C was in the room initially and saw B put a ball in the box.
2. C left the room.
3. After C left: B moved the ball from box to bag, B put a stapler in the box, B left, D moved the ball from bag to basket, I moved the ball from basket to bag.

So C last saw the ball go into the box. C doesn't know about any changes after leaving. C will likely answer "ball" for the box, but the correct answer is "stapler."

Since C is on the Red team, I want C to answer incorrectly. If C answers "ball" (which is what C likely believes), that would be wrong since the box actually contains a stapler. That's good for my team!

However, I should consider whether D might tell C the correct answer. D was in the room the whole time and saw B put the stapler in the box. D could tell C that the box contains a stapler.

But right now it's MY turn, not D's turn. After my action, there may be more turns before the answer phase. Let me think about whether I should do anything.

If I Pass, I save points. C will likely answer "ball" (incorrect), which means Red gets 0 points. That's the best outcome for Blue - Red doesn't score and we don't spend any points.

But if D gets a turn before C answers, D could Tell C the correct contents. However, I can't prevent that.

The best action is to Pass - I don't want to spend points, and C is likely to answer incorrectly on their own since they think the ball is in the box.

Pass
C answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what C knows and whether C can answer correctly.

Let me trace through what C saw and knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room. C sees B put a brick in the bag.
2. C leaves the room. At this point, C knows: bag has brick.
3. After C leaves: D moves brick from bag to basket, B moves brick from basket to bag, B moves brick from bag to box, B puts stapler in bag, B leaves room.

C was outside for all of these moves, so C doesn't know about any of them. C last saw the brick in the bag, so C thinks the bag contains the brick.

The actual contents of the bag: **stapler**.

C will likely answer "brick" for the bag, which is wrong. That means Red gets 0 points from this question.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly, I don't need to spend points to help anyone. I should just Pass.

Wait - but could C's teammate D help? Let me check the turn order. It says it's MY turn now. After my turn, there might be more action phases before the answer phase. But I should consider: D was in the room when the brick was moved from bag to basket, but then D might have left or stayed. Let me re-read.

D was in the room the whole time (never described as leaving). So D knows the bag contains the stapler. D could potentially Tell C the correct answer in a future action phase.

But that would cost Red 0.5 points, and they'd gain 1 point, netting 0.5. 

For me, I should Pass since:
- C is likely to answer wrong (good for us)
- Spending points to Tell C wrong info would cost us 0.5 points, and C might not trust me anyway
- Actually, I could Tell C wrong information to reinforce their wrong belief, but it costs 0.5 points and C already believes the wrong thing

Since C already believes the wrong answer, there's no benefit to spending 0.5 points. The risk is that D tells C the truth. I can't prevent that.

Pass
C answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be optimal.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**D's perspective:**
- D was in the room when C put a ball in the basket.
- D then left the room.
- After D left, C moved the ball from the basket to the bag, and C put a stapler in the basket.
- D doesn't know about these changes, so D thinks the ball is still in the basket.

**The actual state:**
- Bag: ball
- Basket: stapler
- Box: empty

**What D will likely answer:**
D will probably say "ball" for the basket, since that's what D last saw. But the correct answer is "stapler."

**My options:**
- I could Tell D the correct contents (Tell(D, basket, stapler)), but D is on the Red team. If I tell D the truth, D will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point. That would cost my team 0.5 points AND give Red 1 point. Terrible idea.
- I could Tell D incorrect contents (Tell(D, basket, ball)), but D already thinks it's the ball, so this doesn't change anything. It would cost 0.5 points for nothing.
- I could Tell D something misleading like (Tell(D, basket, box)) - wait, that doesn't make sense. I could tell D something wrong to confuse them, but D already has the wrong answer. If D is going to answer "ball" (which is wrong), that's good for my team.
- I could Pass, costing nothing. D will likely answer "ball" which is incorrect, so Red gets 0 points.

The best action is to **Pass**. D will likely answer incorrectly on their own, which is good for my team. Any Tell action to D risks either helping them or costs 0.5 points unnecessarily.

Pass
D answers: ball
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what action would be most beneficial.

Let me trace through what D saw:
1. D was in the room when C put a ball in the basket.
2. D left the room.
3. After D left: C moved the ball from basket to bag, C put a stapler in the basket, and there was movement of the ball between bag and box.

So D thinks the ball is still in the basket (that's the last thing D saw before leaving).

The question is: **What is in the basket?**
The actual answer: The **stapler** is in the basket.

D will likely answer "ball" (which is wrong), since D doesn't know about the changes after leaving.

Since D is on the Red team, I *want* D to answer incorrectly. D's wrong answer means Red doesn't get a point, which is good for us.

If I Tell D the truth (that the stapler is in the basket), that would help the Red team score, which is bad for us. If I Tell D a lie, it costs us 0.5 points but D might still answer wrong (which D would do anyway).

The best action is to **Pass** - D will likely answer "ball" which is wrong, and we don't spend any points.

D answers: ball

Action: I need to think about what D knows and what would help my team.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

**What D saw before leaving:**
- C put a ball in the basket
- Then D left the room

**After D left:**
- B left the room
- C moved the ball from basket to bag
- C put a stapler in the basket
- C moved the ball from bag to box
- I moved the ball from box to bag

**Current state:**
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty
- Basket: stapler

**What D believes:**
D last saw the ball go into the basket. D doesn't know about any changes after leaving. D will likely answer "ball" for the basket.

**The correct answer is: stapler**

Since D is on the Red team, and D will likely answer "ball" (which is wrong), this is good for my team. I should **not** help D get the right answer.

The question is whether C (D's teammate) might tell D the correct answer on C's turn. C was in the room the whole time and knows the basket contains a stapler. But C's turn hasn't come yet in the action phase.

Wait - it's my turn now. I should consider whether to Pass or to actively mislead D. If I Tell D wrong information, it costs 0.5 points. But D is already likely to answer incorrectly ("ball"), so spending points to mislead would be wasteful.

However, C might use their turn to Tell D the correct answer (stapler). If C does that, D would answer correctly and Red gets 1 point. There's nothing I can do to prevent C from telling D the truth on C's turn.

The best action is to **Pass** - D is already likely wrong, and spending points won't help since I can't prevent C from communicating with D later.

D answers: ball

Action: I need to think about what each player knows and what would help my team (Blue) score points.

**What actually happened:**
1. Everyone starts in the room. C puts banana in basket.
2. D leaves the room.
3. B moves banana from basket to bag. (D doesn't see this)
4. C moves banana from bag to basket. (D doesn't see this)
5. B leaves the room. (D knows B left)
6. C moves banana from basket to box. (D doesn't see this)
7. C puts stapler in basket. (D doesn't see this)

**Current state:**
- Bag: empty
- Box: banana
- Basket: stapler

**What D knows:**
D saw C put banana in basket, then D left. D knows B and then later... actually, D left first. After D left, D would know that B left the room at some point. D doesn't know about any object movements after leaving.

So D's last knowledge is: banana is in the basket. D doesn't know about any subsequent moves.

**The question is asking D what's in the basket.**
D will likely answer "banana" (based on what D last saw). The actual answer is "stapler." So D would answer incorrectly, which means Red gets 0 points.

But wait - this is the answer phase for Red (D is being asked). If D answers wrong, Red doesn't score. That's good for Blue. 

Now, should I use my action to help D or hurt D? Since D is on the Red team, I want D to answer **incorrectly**. D currently thinks the basket has a banana, which is wrong. So D is already likely to answer incorrectly.

However, C is on D's team and C knows everything (C was in the room the whole time). C could potentially Tell D the correct answer on C's turn. But right now it's MY turn, not C's turn.

I could try to mislead D by telling D something wrong, but D already has the wrong idea. If I tell D anything, it might make D suspicious or accidentally help. The best move is to Pass and let D answer incorrectly with "banana."

Actually, wait - I need to consider the turn order. It's my turn now. Will C or D get a turn before D has to answer? If C gets a turn, C might Tell D the correct contents.

To be safe, I could try to mislead D. But telling D something might tip D off that things changed. Let me just Pass - spending 0 points and keeping things as they are. D will likely say "banana" which is wrong.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what action would be most beneficial.

**What C knows:** C was in the room when I put the apple in the bag. Then C left the room. After C left, B moved the apple from the bag to the box and put a ball in the bag. C doesn't know about these changes.

So C believes the bag still contains the **apple**.

**The actual contents of the bag:** a **ball**.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag. If C answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point. If C answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points.

C will likely answer "apple" based on their last knowledge. The actual answer is "ball," so C would answer incorrectly — which is good for us.

**Should I Tell C the truth?** No! That would help the Red team and cost us 0.5 points.

**Should I Tell C a lie?** I could tell C something false about the bag to either reinforce their wrong belief or confuse them. But C already has the wrong belief (apple), so telling them anything might make them second-guess themselves. If I tell C "the bag contains an apple," it reinforces their wrong belief but costs 0.5 points — not worth it since they'd already answer wrong.

**Should I Tell C something else to trick them?** If I tell C "the bag contains a ball" (the truth), C might think I'm trying to help them or trick them. This is risky — if C believes me, they'd answer correctly and Red gets a point, costing us net 1.5 points (1 point to Red + 0.5 cost).

**Best action:** Pass. C already has incorrect information and will likely answer "apple" (wrong). No need to spend points or risk changing C's mind.

Pass
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

This is good for us - C will likely get it wrong, scoring 0 for Red.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what I should do.

Let me trace through what C saw before leaving the room:
- C was in the room when I put an apple in the bag.
- Then C left the room.
- After C left: D left, B moved the apple from bag to box, B put a ball in the bag, I moved the apple from box to basket, B moved the apple from basket to box.

So C's last knowledge of the bag is that it contains an **apple** (from before C left).

The actual contents of the bag now: **ball** (B put a ball in the bag after moving the apple out).

C will be asked what's in the bag. C thinks the bag has an apple, but the correct answer is a ball.

Since C is on the Red team, I want C to answer incorrectly. C currently believes the bag has an apple, which is wrong. If I do nothing, C will likely say "apple" and get it wrong, meaning Red doesn't score.

However, if I Tell C the truth (ball), that would help the Red team for 0.5 cost to us - bad idea.

If I Tell C something false, it costs 0.5 points and C might not trust me anyway since I'm on the opposing team.

The best action is to Pass - C will likely answer "apple" (their last known state of the bag) which is incorrect, so Red scores 0 points and we lose nothing.

Action: I need to think about what C knows and what I should do.

Let me trace through what C saw:
1. C was in the room when I put an orange in the bag.
2. C then left the room.
3. After C left: D moved the orange from bag to basket, B moved it from basket to bag, D left, B moved orange from bag to box, B put a ball in the bag.

C doesn't know about any of these moves after leaving. So C believes the orange is still in the bag.

The question is: "What is in the bag?" asked to C.

Currently, the bag contains a ball. C thinks the bag contains an orange.

C will likely answer "orange" (which is wrong - the bag has a ball). This is bad for the Red team and good for us... wait, C is on the Red team. If C answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point. That's fine for us.

But wait - C's teammates (D) could Tell C the correct answer. Let me think about what D knows:
- D was in the room when the orange was put in the bag.
- D saw themselves move the orange from bag to basket.
- D saw B move the orange from basket to bag.
- D then left the room.
- D doesn't know about B moving the orange to the box or putting a ball in the bag.

So D thinks the bag contains the orange too. D would tell C "orange" which is wrong.

The bag actually contains a ball. Neither C nor D knows this. Only A and B know.

If I Pass, C will likely answer "orange" (wrong), and Red gets 0 points. That's good for Blue.

If I Tell C the truth (ball), that costs us 0.5 points and helps Red score 1 point - net bad for us.

I should Pass, since C is on the opposing team and doesn't know the correct answer. No reason to help them.

Pass
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts an orange in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. ... D enters the room. ... C moves the orange from the basket to the bag. ... You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ...

Action: I need to figure out what D knows about the bag and whether I should take any action.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

1. **Everyone starts in the room.** C puts an orange in the bag. Everyone sees this.

2. **D leaves the room.** D doesn't see what happens next.

3. **C moves the orange from the bag to the basket.** A, B, and C see this. D does not.

4. **D enters the room.** At this point, D thinks the orange is still in the bag (D missed the move to the basket).

5. **C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.** Everyone in the room (A, B, C, D) sees this. Now the orange is back in the bag.

6. **A (me) leaves the room.** I don't see what happens next.

7. **B leaves the room.** B doesn't see what happens after this either.

So from my perspective, when I left, the orange was in the bag. After I left, something might have happened (C and D were still in the room), but I don't know what.

D is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the bag. D saw the orange get moved to the bag in step 5, and D was in the room the entire time after that. So D knows the current state of the bag (whatever it is after I left).

Since D is on the Red team and is being asked the question, D will try to answer correctly. D has full knowledge of what happened after I left (since D stayed in the room). I don't know if anything changed after I left.

The question is whether I should spend 0.5 points to try to interfere. Since D is on the Red team and was in the room the whole time after step 4, D knows the current contents of the bag. Any Tell action I send to D could be a lie to mislead D, but D would know I left the room and wouldn't trust information from me over their own direct observation.

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D has direct knowledge of the bag's contents. Spending 0.5 points on an action would just cost my team points without benefit.

Pass
D answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

You, B, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the stapler from the basket to the bag. ... D enters the room. ... You put a banana in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...

Action: I need to think about what D knows about the basket.

Let me trace through D's perspective:

1. D is in the room. D puts a stapler in the basket.
2. D leaves the room.
3. While D is outside: I move the stapler from the basket to the bag. D doesn't see this.
4. D enters the room.
5. I put a banana in the basket. D sees this.
6. I leave the room.

So from D's perspective:
- D put a stapler in the basket initially.
- D left and came back. D doesn't know what happened while away.
- D saw me put a banana in the basket after returning.

Now, D knows a banana was put in the basket (D saw that). But D might think the stapler is still in the basket too - except containers can only hold one object. So when D saw me put a banana in the basket, D would realize the banana replaced whatever was in the basket.

Wait, but D doesn't know I moved the stapler out while D was gone. From D's perspective, the stapler might still have been in the basket when D returned. But then I put a banana in the basket - since each container holds at most one object, putting the banana in would mean the stapler was displaced. But actually, I had already moved the stapler to the bag, so the basket was empty when I put the banana in.

The actual contents of the basket: **banana** (I put it there, and it's the last thing that happened to the basket).

D saw me put the banana in the basket. So D should know the basket contains a banana.

Since D is on the Red team, and the question is asking D what's in the basket, D likely knows the answer is **banana**. This means Red will probably score a point here.

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D directly witnessed me putting the banana in the basket. Any Tell action to D with false information would cost us 0.5 points and D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). 

The best action is to not waste points.

Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0
