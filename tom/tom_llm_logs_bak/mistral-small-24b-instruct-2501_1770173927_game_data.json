  "game_setup": "\nLet's play a game! In this game you will be playing with a teammate against a team of opposing players. For simplicity, the players are referred to as A, B, C, and D. A and B are teammates on the Blue team, and C and D are teammates on the Red team. You are player A. The game is made up of turns, and each turn consists of a scenario, an action phase, and an answer phase. Players need to figure out the right action to take in each action phase, so that their team scores more points than their opponent's team.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn each scenario, one or more of the players start inside a room. The room has two or more containers, and ten or more objects. Each scenario may include:\n- one or more players entering or leaving the room\n- one or more players putting objects into containers\n- one or more players removing objects from containers\nEach container can hold at most one object. Players cannot see inside containers, but when a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room. When a player is outside the room they are unaware of anything that happens in the room, but do know if anyone enters or leaves the room. If an object is put or moved into a container while a player is outside the room, it will not be described to that player, but players leaving or entering the room will be described to that player.\nAt the end of the scenario, I will reveal a question that I will ask in the answer phase.\n\nACTION PHASE\nIn the action phase, the player whose turn it is can take one action: Ask, Tell, or Pass.\nAn Ask action entails asking any player the contents of one container. The format for an Ask action is: Ask(Player, Container); this will result in the player you ask answering your question. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nA Tell action entails telling any player the contents of one container. The format for a Tell action is: Tell(Player, Container, Contents); this will result in the player you tell hearing the answer you give. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nThe format for a Pass action is simply \"Pass\". Nothing changes as a result of this action, and it costs 0 points.\nAsk and Tell actions are private between the two players involved; other players do not hear or see these actions or their results.\nPlayers do not have to tell the truth either in their Tell actions or in response to another player's Ask action. \nA team's points can go negative.\n\nANSWER PHASE\nIn the answer phase, I will ask a target player (not necessarily the player whose turn it is) to name the contents of one container. When a player answers my question correctly, their team gets 1 point. The first team to 4 points wins.\n\nFor the purpose of this study, we're going to repeatedly ask you to make the first move in different runs of this game. Each run is separate and in each run we want you to make the best move in that situation.\n",

This ensures that C has the correct information, but it also risks C lying. However, since C is unaware of the current contents, there is a chance that C might tell the truth.\n\nGiven the scenario, the optimal action is to **Tell(C, Bag, Banana)**.

You already know what is in the basket (a banana), and B is about to be asked what is in the basket, so there's no need to communicate this information to B.\n\n2. **No Need to Influence B's Answer**: Since B was in the room when you put the banana in the basket, B already knows the contents of the basket. Therefore, there's no need to influence B's answer.\n\n3. **Save Points**: By passing, you save 0.5 points for your team, which could be crucial in later turns.\n\nSo, your action should be:\n\nPass",

Since you saw C put a brick in the basket, you already know the answer. However, you need to consider the optimal strategy for your team.\n\nHere are the options:\n1. **Ask(B, Basket)**: This would cost your team 0.5 points, but it would confirm that B, who left the room, does not know the contents of the basket. This could be useful information for future turns.\n2. **Tell(B, Basket, Brick)**: This would cost your team 0.5 points and inform B about the contents of the basket, which could be useful if B is asked about the basket in the future.\n3. **Pass**: This would cost your team 0 points but would not provide any new information or strategic advantage.\n\nGiven that you already know the contents of the basket and want to minimize point loss, the best action is to **Pass**. This way, you avoid losing any points and can still answer the question correctly in the answer phase.\n\nYour action: Pass",

D left the room before any objects were moved into containers, so D does not know the contents of any containers.\n4. You moved the brick from the box to the bag, and then B moved it back to the box, so you and B know the brick's final location, but C does not.\n\nSince B already knows the contents of the basket, there's no need to tell B. However, to ensure B is confident and to potentially mislead the opposing team, you can tell C the contents of the basket. This might confuse C and D, making them less likely to guess correctly if asked about the basket.\n\nYour action: Tell(C, basket, apple)",

Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Current State**: D will be asked what is in the box. The apple is currently in the box.\n2. **Objective**: Ensure that D's answer is correct, or at least make it difficult for the Red team to score.\n\nSince D is the one who will be asked, and we know the apple is in the box, we need to consider the following:\n\n- **Asking D**: This would cost us 0.5 points and might not guarantee a correct answer since D could lie.\n- **Telling D**: This would also cost us 0.5 points but could ensure D knows the correct answer. However, D might still lie.\n- **Passing**: This costs us 0 points but leaves D's knowledge of the box's contents uncertain.\n\nGiven that D is the one who will be asked, and we want to maximize our chances of scoring, the best move might be to **Tell D** the correct contents of the box. This ensures that D knows the correct answer, even if D might lie, it's a strategic move to ensure our team has control over the information.\n\n**Action**: Tell(D, box, apple)\n\nThis action costs us 0.5 points but increases the likelihood that D will answer correctly, giving us a chance to score a point.",

C left the room after putting the stapler in the box and before any other movements of the stapler. Therefore, C believes the stapler is still in the box.\n\nTo maximize our chances of scoring a point, we should ensure that C's answer is incorrect. Since C believes the stapler is in the box, we should not reveal the true location of the stapler to C. Therefore, the optimal action is to do nothing that would inform C of the stapler's true location.\n\nYour action: Pass",

B might not know the current state of the bag.\n   - **Ask C or D**: Both C and D were in the room for all the movements of the brick.

This keeps our points intact and does not reveal any information to the opposing team. We can then rely on the fact that D might not know the contents of the basket, especially if they were not paying close attention or if they were outside the room at some point.\n\nYour action: **Pass**",

I don't know the contents of the bag, but D put an apple in the bag while I was in the room.\n3. C was also in the room and saw D put the apple in the bag.\n4. I am going to leave the room, so I won't be able to see or hear anything that happens inside the room.\n5. I want to maximize my team's points and minimize the opponent's points.\n\nWith this in mind, I will take the following action:\n\nTell(B, bag, apple)\n\nThis action will inform my teammate B about the contents of the bag, which will help us coordinate better in future turns. It costs 0.5 points, but it's a strategic move to ensure we have the same information.",
