Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room the entire time
- C put a ball in the bag
- D left the room after this happened
- The bag contains a ball

**Current situation:**
- I will be asked what is in the bag
- I know the answer: it's a ball
- I can answer correctly and earn 1 point for my team

**Should I take an action?**
- I already know the contents of the bag (a ball)
- There's no need to Ask anyone since I have direct knowledge
- There's no strategic benefit to Tell anyone right now
- Any action would cost 0.5 points unnecessarily

Since I already know the answer to the question I'll be asked, and I can answer it correctly to earn 1 point for my team, there's no reason to spend points on an Ask or Tell action.

**Pass**
A answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me track what happened:
1. C puts a ball in the bag
2. D leaves the room
3. I put a brick in the basket
4. C moves the brick from the basket to the box
5. I move the brick from the box to the basket

Current state:

- Basket: brick

What each player knows:
- Me (A): I saw everything, so I know the bag has a ball
- B: Was in the room the whole time, knows the bag has a ball
- C: Was in the room the whole time, knows the bag has a ball
- D: Left before I put the brick in the basket, but D saw C put the ball in the bag, so D knows the bag has a ball

I'm going to be asked what is in the bag. I know the answer is "ball" - I was present when C put the ball in the bag.

Since I already know the answer to the question I'll be asked, there's no need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. I put a brick in the basket
2. I left the room (so I can't see what happens next)
3. I entered the room (I can see again)
4. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket (wait, this is confusing - the brick was in the basket when I left, but now C is moving it FROM the bag TO the basket)
5. D leaves the room
6. B moves the brick from the basket to the box
7. C puts a banana in the basket

So at the end of the scenario:
- The brick is in the box
- The banana is in the basket
- The bag is empty

The question will be asked to me: "What is in the basket?"

I know the answer is **banana** because I witnessed C put a banana in the basket after B moved the brick to the box.

I am going to ask you what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. I, B, and D are in the room with an empty bag, box, and basket.
2. D puts a stapler in the bag.
3. I leave the room.
4. (Something happens while I'm outside - I don't see it)
5. I enter the room.
6. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag.

Wait - step 6 says D moves the stapler "from the box to the bag." But I last saw the stapler in the bag before I left. This means while I was outside, someone must have moved the stapler from the bag to the box. Then when I returned, I witnessed D moving it from the box back to the bag.

So currently, the stapler is in the bag.

I'm being asked what is in the bag. Based on what I witnessed:
- The stapler ended up in the bag (D moved it from box to bag while I was present)

I'm confident the answer is "stapler" - I directly observed D put the stapler in the bag as the last action.

Since I know the answer (the stapler is in the bag), I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

A answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Action: I need to analyze this situation.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. All four players (A, B, C, D) start in the room
2. B leaves the room
3. C leaves the room
4. I (A) put an apple in the basket
5. D puts an orange in the bag
6. I move the orange from the bag to the box
7. D moves the orange from the box to the bag
8. I leave the room

At the end of the scenario:
- Basket contains: apple
- Bag contains: orange
- Box contains: empty

I am going to be asked what is in the basket. I was present when I put the apple in the basket, and I was present for all subsequent actions until I left. No one touched the basket after I put the apple in it (while I was in the room). After I left, I don't know what happened, but the scenario doesn't describe any further actions.

Based on my knowledge, the basket contains an apple. I know this with certainty from my own actions, and I saw everything that happened while I was in the room - no one moved the apple.

Since I already know the answer to the question I'll be asked, there's no need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. Everyone starts in the room (me, B, C, D)
2. B leaves the room
3. C leaves the room
4. I put a ball in the basket
5. I leave the room
6. I enter the room
7. D moves the ball from basket to bag
8. D moves the ball from bag to basket
9. I leave the room
10. B enters the room
11. B leaves the room

So when I last left the room (step 9), the ball was in the basket. After that, B entered and left, but I would be aware if any objects were moved while I was outside - wait, no. The rules say "When a player is outside the room they are unaware of anything that happens in the room."

Let me reconsider: After I left in step 9, B entered (step 10) and then left (step 11). I don't know what happened while B was in the room because I was outside.

However, the scenario describes what I "see" - and it doesn't mention any movements after I left in step 9. The scenario only describes what I'm aware of. Since nothing is described happening between B entering and leaving, it seems nothing happened.

Based on my knowledge:
- When I left the room the final time, the ball was in the basket
- I have no information about anything changing after that

I'm being asked what's in the basket. Based on my last observation, the ball is in the basket.

Since I'm confident in my answer and it's my turn to answer, I should Pass to avoid losing points unnecessarily.

Pass
A answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about this situation strategically.

Let me analyze what I know:
- I put a ball in the box
- B was outside the room when I did this, so B doesn't know what's in the box
- C and D were in the room when I put the ball in the box, so they know what's in the box

I'm going to be asked what's in the box. Since I'm the one who put the ball there, I know the answer is "ball." I don't need to ask anyone or tell anyone anything to answer this question correctly.

However, I should consider if C or D might have moved the ball after I left the room. The scenario says "You leave the room. ..." with ellipses, suggesting time passed. But I wasn't told about any objects being moved - though that's because I was outside the room and wouldn't be informed of such movements.

Wait, but the question is being asked to ME. I know I put a ball in the box. The risk is that C or D could have removed it after I left. But spending 0.5 points to ask C or D what's in the box would only be worth it if I'm uncertain AND they would tell me the truth. Since C and D are opponents, they might lie to me.

Given that:
1. I know I put a ball in the box
2. Asking opponents costs 0.5 points and they might lie
3. The expected value of asking is questionable

I should Pass and answer "ball" based on my own knowledge.

**Pass**
A answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a ball in the box
- I put an orange in the basket
- The bag is empty (nothing was put in it while I was there)

**What happened:**
- B left the room before I put anything in containers, so B doesn't know what's in any container
- C and D were in the room the whole time I was there, so they saw me put the ball in the box and the orange in the basket
- After I left, I don't know if anything changed (C and D could have moved objects)

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the box.

**My knowledge:** When I left, the ball was in the box. However, C and D (opponents) were still in the room after I left, and they could have moved things around.

Since I'm the one being asked the question, and I need to answer what's in the box:
- If nothing changed after I left, the answer is "ball"
- But C and D could have manipulated the containers after I left

The scenario shows "..." after I leave, suggesting time passed, but it doesn't tell me if C or D did anything (because I was outside the room and wouldn't see it).

Since I'm being asked the question and I last saw the ball in the box, I should answer based on my knowledge. Taking an action would cost points, and I already know what I put in the box.

Let me trace what happened:
1. I, B, C, and D start in the room
2. B leaves the room
3. I put a brick in the bag (I saw this)

So the final state of the bag is: it contains the brick.

I was present for all the relevant movements:
- I put the brick in the bag initially
- I saw D move it to the basket
- I saw C move it back to the bag

Since I know the answer (the brick is in the bag), and I'm going to be asked what's in the bag, I don't need to spend points on any action.

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. All four players (A, B, C, D) start in the room
2. D leaves the room
3. I (A) put a stapler in the bag (B and C saw this, D did not)
4. D enters the room
5. I (A) leave the room
6. C leaves the room

So the current state is:
- The bag contains a stapler
- B and D are in the room
- C and I (A) are outside the room

What do I know? I put the stapler in the bag myself, so I know exactly what's in the bag.

The question will be asked to me: "what is in the bag?"

Since I personally put the stapler in the bag, I know with certainty that the bag contains a stapler. After I left the room, only B and D remained. I would be aware if anyone left or entered, but I wouldn't know if they moved objects around.

However, looking at the scenario, it says C leaves the room after I do, and that's all that's described. No other actions are mentioned after I left.

Since I know I put the stapler in the bag, and I have no information suggesting it was moved (though it could have been moved while I was outside), I should consider whether to spend points gathering information.

But wait - I'm the one being asked the question. I know what I put in the bag (stapler), and there's no indication anything changed. Spending 0.5 points to ask someone would only make sense if I'm uncertain.

Given that I directly placed the stapler in the bag and the scenario doesn't indicate any further changes, I should save the points and answer based on my knowledge.

Pass
A answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

5. B puts an orange in the basket (everyone in room sees this: A, B, C, D)
6. I (A) leave the room
7. C leaves the room

Now I'm outside the room. The question will be asked to me about what's in the bag.

I know I put a stapler in the bag. Since I left the room after that, I need to consider if anything could have changed. After I left, only B and D remained in the room. I would have been told if anyone entered or left, but I wasn't told about any container manipulations (since I was outside).

However, the key point is: I'm the one being asked the question, and I personally put the stapler in the bag. Unless B or D moved it after I left (which I wouldn't know about), the stapler should still be in the bag.

Since I'm being asked the question and I have direct knowledge of putting the stapler in the bag, I should be confident in my answer. There's no need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Everyone starts in the room (me, B, C, D)
2. D leaves the room
3. I put a ball in the bag (B and C see this, D doesn't)
4. D enters the room

7. D moves the ball from the bag to the basket (I see this)
8. C moves the ball from the basket to the bag (I see this)
9. I leave the room
10. C leaves the room

So at the point I left the room (step 9), the ball was in the bag (C had just moved it there).

After I left, C also left. B was still in the room. I don't know if anything happened after I left, but the scenario doesn't mention any actions after C leaves.

Wait - let me re-read. The scenario shows what I see. After I leave the room, I wouldn't see any actions that happen inside. But the scenario ends with "C leaves the room" which I would be aware of (people entering/leaving is known to those outside).

Since no actions are described after I left (and I would only see people entering/leaving), and B was the only one remaining in the room, I need to consider if B did anything. But the scenario doesn't indicate any time passing or actions after C left.

Based on what I observed, the ball should be in the bag (C moved it there before I left).

I'm being asked what's in the bag. I saw C put the ball in the bag, and nothing happened after that (that I'm aware of). So my answer should be "ball."

Since I'm confident in my knowledge, I should Pass to save points.

Let me analyze what I know:
- I was in the room when C put an apple in the box
- Then I left the room
- I don't know what happened after I left (if anything)

Since I was present when C put the apple in the box, I directly observed this action. I know the box contained an apple at that point. However, after I left the room, I cannot know if anything changed (someone might have moved the apple or put something else in the box).

But looking at the scenario description, it only shows "..." after I left, with no indication that B, C, or D did anything else before the scenario ended. The ellipsis just indicates passage of time, not necessarily any actions.

Given that:
1. I directly saw C put an apple in the box
2. There's no indication anything happened after I left
3. I'm going to be asked what's in the box

I'm confident the answer is "apple" based on my direct observation. Taking an action would cost 0.5 points, and since I already know the answer from my own observation, there's no benefit to asking or telling anyone.

But wait - the scenario only shows what happened up until "You leave the room. ..." and then the ellipsis. I don't have information about anything happening after I left. The question is asking me what's in the box.

Based on my direct observation before leaving, the box contains an apple. I don't need to ask anyone because I saw this myself. The only risk is if something changed after I left, but I have no indication that it did.

Since I already know the answer (apple) from my own observation, there's no need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

Pass
A answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about this situation.

Let me recall what I observed:
- I was in the room when C put an apple in the box
- I was in the room when D put a brick in the basket
- Then I left the room

Since I was present when C put the apple in the box, I know the contents of the box (unless something changed after I left). However, I left the room, so I don't know if anything happened after I left.

But wait - the question is asking ME what is in the box, and I will be the one answering. I saw the apple being put in the box, and I have no information about anything changing after I left.

Since I already know what was in the box when I left (an apple), and I'm the one being asked, I don't need to spend points to Ask anyone. The best action is to Pass and save my team's points, then answer "apple" when asked.

Pass
A answers: apple

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a ball in the box. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... C moves the ball from the box to the basket. ... D moves the ball from the basket to the box. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box.

Let me trace through what I observed:
1. I was in the room when C put a ball in the box.
2. I left the room.
3. I entered the room.
4. I saw C move the ball from the box to the basket.
5. I saw D move the ball from the basket to the box.
6. I left the room.

So when I left the room the second time, the ball was in the box.

The question is: did anything happen after I left the room the second time? Looking at the scenario, it ends with "You leave the room. ..." - the ellipsis suggests time passed, but no actions are described after that.

Since I observed D move the ball to the box, and nothing is described as happening after I left (even though time passed), I should know the ball is in the box based on my last observation.

However, I'm currently outside the room, so I don't know if anything happened after I left. But since no actions were described after my departure, I can reasonably conclude the ball is still in the box.

I'm confident the answer is "ball" for the box. I don't need to spend points asking anyone.

Pass
A answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put an orange in the basket
- B was in the room when I put the orange in the basket, so B saw this
- B then left the room
- D also left the room
- C is still in the room with me

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the basket.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the basket."

So B will be asked about the basket contents. B was present when I put the orange in the basket, so B knows the orange is in the basket.

**After B left:**
- C and I remained in the room
- Nothing else happened to the basket (no objects were moved)

So B's knowledge is accurate - the orange is still in the basket, and B knows this from when they witnessed me putting it there.

**Should I take an action?**
- B already knows the correct answer (orange in basket)
- Telling B would cost 0.5 points and is unnecessary
- B is my teammate, so B answering correctly gives us 1 point

The optimal play is to Pass, since B already has the correct information and will answer correctly, giving us 1 point without any cost.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Let me trace what happened:
1. All players (A, B, C, D) start in the room
2. I put an orange in the basket (everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room
4. D leaves the room
5. I put a banana in the bag (only A and C see this)
6. C moves the banana from bag to box (only A and C see this)
7. I move the banana from box to bag (only A and C see this)

Current state:
- Basket: orange
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty

B's knowledge:
- B saw me put an orange in the basket
- B left before any other actions
- B knows the basket contains an orange

Since B is being asked about the basket, and B was present when I put the orange in the basket, B should know the correct answer (orange). B hasn't seen anything happen to the basket after leaving, and nothing did happen to the basket - it still contains the orange.

B should be able to answer correctly without any help from me. Spending 0.5 points to tell B something they already know would be wasteful.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know (as player A who was in the room the whole time):**
- Final state: stapler is in the basket, apple is in the box, bag is empty

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put the stapler in the basket
- B left before any other movements happened
- So B thinks: stapler is in the basket (which happens to be correct!)

**What will happen:**
- B will be asked what's in the basket
- B believes the stapler is in the basket (based on what B saw before leaving)
- The stapler IS actually in the basket

B will likely answer "stapler" which is correct! This means our Blue team will get 1 point without me needing to spend 0.5 points on a Tell action.

Since B's belief aligns with reality (the stapler is in the basket), I should Pass to save points.

So currently, the box contains the **stapler**.

Now, what does B know? B left after step 5, so B saw:
- C put an apple in the box
- I moved the apple from the box to the bag
- I put a stapler in the box

B thinks the box contains the **stapler**, which is actually correct!

B doesn't know about the movements C made after B left (moving the apple to basket, moving stapler to bag and back to box), but those movements ended up putting the stapler back in the box anyway.

Since B will be asked what's in the box, and B correctly believes it's the stapler, I should **Pass**. Telling B would cost 0.5 points and B already has the correct answer.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put an orange in the bag (B saw this)
- B left the room
- After B left: I put a banana in the box
- After B left: C moved the banana from box to basket
- After B left: D moved the banana from basket back to box

**What B knows:**
- B knows they put an orange in the bag
- B doesn't know about any movements after they left

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: orange
- Box: banana
- Basket: empty

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the bag.

B knows they put an orange in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after B left. The orange is still in the bag. B should correctly answer "orange" without any help from me.

Since B has the correct information to answer this question (B personally put the orange in the bag and nothing changed after that), there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something they already know.

**Pass**
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put an orange in the bag, then left the room
- After B left: D put a brick in the box, I moved the brick to the basket, D moved it back to the box, C moved it to the basket
- B was not in the room for any of the brick movements

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: orange
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

**What B knows:**
- B put an orange in the bag
- B left the room and doesn't know about any subsequent changes
- The bag still contains the orange (it was never moved)

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the bag."

So B will be asked about the bag. B knows they put an orange in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. B should correctly answer "orange" since:
1. B put the orange there
2. No one moved the orange after B left
3. The orange is still in the bag

B has complete knowledge about the bag's contents. B should answer correctly without any help from me.

**Decision:** Since B knows the correct answer (orange is in the bag, and B put it there), there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something they already know.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

**What I know:**
- B put a brick in the box, then left the room
- After B left: D moved the brick from box to bag, C put a ball in the box, D moved the ball from box to basket, C moved the brick from bag to box
- Current state: The box contains the brick

**What B knows:**
- B only saw themselves put a brick in the box, then left
- B is unaware of all the movements that happened after they left
- B likely thinks the brick is still in the box

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the box, but wait - the question says "I am going to ask B what is in the box."

So B will be asked. B thinks the brick is in the box (based on when they left). The brick IS actually in the box now (C moved it back).

So B will likely answer "brick" which is correct! B's team (Blue team, my team) will get 1 point.

Since B will likely answer correctly without any intervention from me, I should Pass to avoid spending points unnecessarily.

**Pass**
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

**The correct answer:** The bag contains an orange.

**B's likely answer:** B will probably say "banana" because that's what B last knew to be in the bag.

Since B is my teammate and will likely answer incorrectly (costing us the point), I should tell B what's actually in the bag so they can answer correctly.

- After B left: C moved the banana from bag to box, D put an orange in the bag, C left, then there were more movements of the banana

**What B knows:**

- B left before any other changes happened

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the bag.

**B's likely answer:** B probably thinks the banana is still in the bag (since that's the last thing B saw before leaving). But the correct answer is the orange.

**My options:**
1. Tell B that the bag contains an orange - costs 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point (net +0.5)
2. Pass - costs nothing, but B will likely answer "banana" which is wrong (net 0)

**What B knows:**
B left the room after C put a ball in the box. So B's last knowledge is:

B will answer based on what B believes. B believes the box contains the ball (since B left before the changes happened).

B will likely answer "ball" which is **incorrect** (the box actually contains a banana).

So B will be asked directly. B believes the apple is in the bag (since B doesn't know about the changes that happened after leaving).

**Should I help B?**
- B is my teammate
- B will likely answer "apple" because that's what B believes
- But the actual contents is a "stapler"
- If the question is about what's actually in the bag, B will answer wrong

I should Tell B the correct contents of the bag so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost is 0.5 points, but the potential gain is 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

**My action:**
Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the bag, then left the room
- After B left: D moved the apple from bag to box, D put a stapler in the bag, C moved apple from box to basket, D moved apple from basket to box, I moved apple from box to basket
- Current state: The bag contains a stapler, the basket contains the apple

**What B knows:**
- B only knows that they put an apple in the bag before leaving
- B is unaware of everything that happened after they left
- B likely thinks the apple is still in the bag

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the bag. The answer is "stapler."

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the bag."

So B will be asked about the bag's contents. B thinks the apple is in the bag (since B left before any changes), but the actual answer is the stapler.

B is my teammate. If B answers "apple" (what B believes), B will be wrong and we get 0 points. I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and we get 1 point.

The cost of Tell is 0.5 points, but if it helps B answer correctly, we gain 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

B knows the answer is "apple" and should answer correctly, earning our team 1 point. There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points on an Ask or Tell action since B already has the correct information.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. B puts a stapler in the box (B, D, and I all see this)
2. B leaves the room
3. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag (only D and I see this - B is outside)
4. B enters the room
5. D puts a ball in the box (B, D, and I all see this)
6. D leaves the room

So the current state is:
- Box contains: ball
- Bag contains: stapler
- Basket: empty

Now, what does B know?
- B saw themselves put the stapler in the box
- B was outside when D moved the stapler to the bag
- B saw D put a ball in the box after returning

B should know the box contains a ball because B witnessed D putting the ball in the box after returning. B doesn't know the stapler was moved, but B did see the ball being placed in the box.

Since B witnessed D putting the ball in the box, B should correctly answer "ball" when asked what's in the box.

I don't need to spend points telling B something they already know. B saw D put the ball in the box, so B should answer correctly.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

B knows the answer is "ball" because B was present when I put the ball in the bag. B and I are teammates, so B answering correctly gives our team 1 point.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. B puts an apple in the box (everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room
4. C moves the apple from the box to the basket (A, C, D see this; B doesn't)
5. B enters the room
6. D puts a stapler in the box (everyone sees this)
7. D leaves the room
8. C leaves the room
9. B moves the apple from the box to the bag (A and B see this - but wait, the apple isn't in the box anymore!)

Wait, let me re-read this. The scenario says "B moves the apple from the box to the bag" - but the apple was in the basket at this point, not the box. This seems like an error in the scenario, or perhaps B attempted to move something that wasn't there.

Actually, looking more carefully: After C moved the apple to the basket, D put a stapler in the box. Then "B moves the apple from the box to the bag" - this is what the scenario states happened, so I should take it as given that this action occurred (perhaps the apple was somehow back in the box, or this is what B believes they did).

Let me re-trace:
- B puts apple in box
- B leaves
- C moves apple from box to basket
- B enters
- D puts stapler in box
- D leaves, C leaves
- B moves apple from box to bag
- I put a ball in the box

Current state: The box contains a ball.

What does B know? B was present when I put the ball in the box. So B should know the box contains a ball.

Since B witnessed me putting the ball in the box, B should correctly answer "ball" when asked what's in the box.

I should Pass since B already has the correct information.

B answers: ball

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a stapler in the basket. ... D puts a banana in the bag. ... C moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... You move the banana from the box to the bag. ... D moves the banana from the bag to the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

Action: Pass

The question will be asking B what is in the basket. B was in the room the entire time and personally put the stapler in the basket. The stapler was never moved from the basket throughout the scenario.

B knows the answer (stapler) and doesn't need any information from me. Taking any action would cost 0.5 points unnecessarily.
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a banana in the basket, then left the room
- While B was outside, C moved the banana from the basket to the bag
- B re-entered the room
- D put a brick in the basket

**What B knows:**
- B saw themselves put the banana in the basket
- B was outside when C moved the banana to the bag, so B doesn't know about this
- B re-entered and saw D put a brick in the basket
- So B knows the brick is in the basket (B saw D put it there after returning)

Wait, let me reconsider. When B re-entered the room, B would see D put a brick in the basket. So B knows the basket contains a brick.

**Current state of the basket:** brick (this is correct)

**What B believes is in the basket:** B saw D put a brick in the basket after returning, so B should know the basket contains a brick.

Since B witnessed D putting the brick in the basket after B returned to the room, B should correctly answer "brick" when asked what's in the basket.

I don't need to spend points to tell B something they already know. B should answer correctly on their own.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

1. **Me (A)**: I put a ball in the box. I know the box contains a ball.

2. **B**: B left the room before I put the ball in the box, then re-entered after I put the ball in. When B re-entered, B would see the current state of the room but wouldn't know what happened while they were away. B doesn't know what's in the box (they can't see inside containers).

3. **C**: C was in the room the entire time and saw me put the ball in the box. C knows the box contains a ball.

4. **D**: D left before I put the ball in the box and re-entered after. Like B, D doesn't know what's in the box.

The question will be asked to B about what's in the box. B doesn't know the answer (ball), but I do know it.

Since B is my teammate and needs to answer correctly for our team to get 1 point, I should tell B what's in the box. This costs 0.5 points but gains us 1 point if B answers correctly, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

If I Pass, B would have to guess, and might get it wrong (there are many possible objects).

The optimal action is to tell B the contents of the box.

Tell(B, box, ball)
B answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

**What I (A) saw:**
- Everyone started in the room
- B left the room
- D left the room
- I put a ball in the box
- B entered the room
- D entered the room
- D put a brick in the basket
- I left the room

**What B knows:**
- B left before I put the ball in the box
- B returned after I put the ball in the box
- B was present when D put a brick in the basket
- B does NOT know what's in the box (B was outside when I put the ball there)

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the box.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the box."

So B will be asked about the box contents. B was outside the room when I put the ball in the box, so B doesn't know there's a ball in the box. B might guess it's empty (since it was empty when B left) or might not know.

Since B is my teammate and doesn't know the box contains a ball, I should tell B so they can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point.

The cost of telling is 0.5 points, and if B answers correctly, we get 1 point. Net gain = 0.5 points.

If I pass and B guesses wrong, we get 0 points.

So the optimal action is to tell B what's in the box.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation.

**What I know:**
- I put a brick in the bag while everyone (B, C, D) was in the room
- Then I left the room
- Then B left the room
- C and D remained in the room after B and I left

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put the brick in the bag (B was in the room when this happened)
- B doesn't know what happened after B left (C and D were still in the room and could have moved things)

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the bag."

So B will be asked about the bag contents. B saw me put the brick in the bag, but B left the room while C and D were still inside. C and D (opponents) could have moved the brick after B left.

**Should I take an action?**
- B knows I put a brick in the bag
- B doesn't know if C or D changed anything after B left
- I also don't know if C or D changed anything (I left before B did)

Since B already knows what was in the bag when B left (the brick), and I don't have any additional information about what happened after I left, telling B wouldn't add useful information. B's best guess is still "brick" based on what B observed.

Taking an action would cost 0.5 points and wouldn't improve B's knowledge beyond what B already has.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a brick in the bag
- B put an orange in the basket
- Both B and I left the room
- C and D remained in the room after we left

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put a brick in the bag (B was in the room when this happened)
- B put an orange in the basket
- B doesn't know what happened after we both left (C and D could have moved things)

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the bag."

So B will be asked about the bag. B saw me put a brick in the bag. However, after we both left, C and D were still in the room and could have moved the brick or put something else in the bag.

B knows the brick was in the bag when we left, but B doesn't know if C or D changed anything after we left.

Since I also left the room, I don't know what C and D did either. So I cannot provide B with any additional useful information about what's currently in the bag.

B already has the same information I have about the bag - that a brick was placed there, but we don't know if it was moved after we left.

Taking an action would cost 0.5 points, and I have no new information to share with B that would help. B already knows a brick was in the bag when we left.

- D put a stapler in the basket (I saw this)
- The box is empty (nothing was put in it while I was there)
- I left the room, then B left the room

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put a brick in the bag
- B saw D put a stapler in the basket
- B was in the room when I left, but then B also left

**Key question:** Did anything happen after I left but before B left?

Looking at the scenario, after I left the room, the only thing that happened was "B leaves the room." So nothing changed in the containers between when I left and when B left.

**What B should know:**
- The bag contains a brick (B saw me put it there)

Since B was present when I put the brick in the bag, B should know the correct answer. B doesn't need any additional information from me.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. I, B, C, and D are all in the room initially
2. I put a stapler in the box (everyone sees this)
3. I leave the room
4. B leaves the room
5. D leaves the room (only C remains in the room)
6. D enters the room (C and D are in the room - I don't know what happens inside)
7. B enters the room (B, C, and D are in the room - I don't know what happens)
8. B leaves the room

The key question: Does B know what's in the box?

When B was last in the room, B could have observed any changes that C made while alone, or that C and D made together. However, B was present when I originally put the stapler in the box.

The critical period is when C was alone in the room (after D left and before D re-entered). C could have moved the stapler. Then when D entered, they could have done something. When B entered, B would have seen the current state but wouldn't necessarily know what's in the box unless someone opened it or moved things while B was watching.

Since B was in the room when I put the stapler in the box, B knows the stapler was originally there. But B left, and things could have changed while B was out. When B re-entered, B would only know about changes that happened while B was present.

B might not know the current contents of the box with certainty. I should tell B what I know - that I put a stapler in the box. B needs this information to answer correctly (assuming nothing changed, or to have a basis for answering).

Tell(B, box, stapler)
B answers: stapler

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Current situation:
- I put an apple in the bag
- B left the room, then C left the room
- D is still in the room with me
- C will be asked what's in the bag

What does C know?
- C was in the room when I put the apple in the bag
- C saw me put the apple in the bag
- So C knows the bag contains an apple

Since C knows the correct answer (apple in the bag), C will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for the Red team.

My options:
1. **Tell(C, bag, [wrong item])** - I could try to deceive C, but C was in the room and saw me put the apple in the bag. C knows the truth, so lying to C won't help - C will just ignore my false information.

2. **Ask** - This doesn't help me prevent C from answering correctly.

3. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but C will still answer correctly.

Since C directly witnessed me putting the apple in the bag, C has firsthand knowledge. Any attempt to Tell C false information would be pointless because C knows what actually happened. C won't be fooled by me telling them something different from what they personally observed.

The best action is to save my team's points since I cannot change the outcome here.

**Pass**
C answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put an apple in the bag (everyone saw this initially)
- B left the room, then C left the room
- After they left, I put a brick in the box
- D moved the brick from box to basket
- I moved the brick from basket back to box

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put the apple in the bag (C was in the room then)
- C left before the brick movements happened
- C should correctly believe the bag contains an apple

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask C what is in the bag."

So C will be asked about the bag's contents. C saw me put the apple in the bag before leaving. C has no reason to think the apple was moved (C wasn't there to see any changes to the bag, and indeed the bag wasn't touched after the apple was placed).

C should answer "apple" which is correct. This means the Red team will get 1 point.

**Should I take an action?**
- I could Tell C wrong information, but C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team)
- I could Ask or Tell my teammate B, but B isn't being asked the question
- Any Tell to C would cost us 0.5 points and C would likely ignore misinformation from an opponent

Since C witnessed the apple being placed in the bag and has accurate information, there's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly. Spending 0.5 points to Tell C false information would likely be ignored since I'm an opponent.

**Best action:** Pass (save our points)

Pass
C answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put an apple in the bag (everyone present saw this: me, B, C, D)
- B left the room
- C left the room
- After C left, various ball movements happened, but the bag contents never changed

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put an apple in the bag before leaving
- C doesn't know about any changes after leaving, but the bag contents didn't change anyway

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask C what is in the bag."

So C will be asked about the bag contents. C saw me put an apple in the bag before leaving. The apple is still in the bag (nothing happened to it after C left).

C should correctly answer "apple" because:
1. C saw the apple being put in the bag
2. The apple was never moved

Since C has the correct information and should answer correctly, there's no need for me to spend points on a Tell action to inform C. C already knows the answer.

**My optimal action:** Pass

Pass
C answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a brick in the bag initially
- B left the room, then C left the room
- After C left, D made several moves:
  - Moved brick from bag to box
  - Put ball in bag
  - Moved ball from bag to basket
  - Moved brick from box to bag

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: brick
- Box: empty
- Basket: ball

**What C knows:**
C left the room before D made any changes. C last saw me put a brick in the bag. So C believes the bag contains a brick.

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read. "I am going to ask C what is in the bag."

So C will be asked about the bag's contents. C left before D's movements, so C still thinks the brick is in the bag (which happens to be correct now, since D moved the brick back to the bag).

C will likely answer "brick" - which is actually correct! This means the Red team would get 1 point.

**Should I take an action?**
- If I Tell C something false, C might give a wrong answer, but C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team)
- C's belief (brick in bag) happens to match reality, so Red will likely score

Since C is on the opposing team and will likely answer correctly based on their own knowledge, telling them false information might not help (they'd probably trust their own memory over an opponent's claim).

I'll Pass since:
1. Any Tell to C costs 0.5 points and C likely won't trust me
2. C's answer will probably be correct anyway based on their memory

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. C puts a stapler in the box (everyone in room sees this: A, B, C, D)
2. B leaves the room
3. D moves the stapler from the box to the bag (A, C, D see this; B doesn't)
4. C puts a ball in the box (A, C, D see this; B doesn't)
5. D leaves the room

Current state:
- Bag: stapler
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

What does D know?
- D saw the stapler go in the box
- D moved the stapler to the bag
- D saw C put a ball in the box
- D left the room, but nothing happened after that

So D knows the box contains a ball.

I'm on the Blue team (with B), and D is on the Red team. The question will be asked to D about what's in the box. D knows the correct answer (ball), so D will likely answer correctly and Red team gets 1 point.

My options:
1. **Pass** - costs nothing, but D will answer correctly (Red +1)
2. **Tell(D, box, [wrong answer])** - costs 0.5 points, but D knows the truth and won't be fooled since D was present when the ball was placed
3. **Ask** - doesn't help here

Since D was in the room when the ball was placed in the box, D knows the correct answer. Telling D false information won't help because D has direct knowledge. Any Tell action would just cost us 0.5 points without benefit.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room with empty containers
2. C puts stapler in box (everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room
4. D moves stapler from box to bag (A, C, D see this; B doesn't)
5. C puts ball in box (A, C, D see this; B doesn't)
6. D leaves the room
7. C moves stapler from bag to basket (A, C see this; B, D don't)
8. I (A) move stapler from basket to bag (A, C see this; B, D don't)
9. C moves stapler from bag to basket (A, C see this; B, D don't)

Current state:
- Box: ball
- Basket: stapler
- Bag: empty

What does D believe?
D last saw: stapler in bag, ball in box. D left after step 6, so D thinks:
- Box: ball
- Bag: stapler
- Basket: empty

The question is: What is in the box?

D will likely answer "ball" because that's what D last saw in the box, and that's actually correct! The ball IS in the box.

So D (Red team) will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for Red team.

Should I try to mislead D? D is on the opposing team. If I tell D false information, D might believe me or might not. But D has direct knowledge that the ball was put in the box, and D never saw it moved. D has no reason to think the ball moved.

Since D will likely answer correctly anyway based on their own knowledge, spending 0.5 points to try to mislead them probably won't work - D would trust their own observation over my claim.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

7. I move the stapler from bag to basket
8. C moves the stapler from basket to bag
9. I move the stapler from bag to basket

Current state: The box contains a ball, the basket contains the stapler, the bag is empty.

What does D know?
- D saw C put stapler in box
- D moved stapler from box to bag
- D saw C put ball in box
- D left the room after this

So D's last knowledge of the box is that it contains a ball. D doesn't know about any changes after leaving.

The question is: What is in the box?
Answer: A ball

D will be asked what's in the box. Based on D's knowledge, D should correctly answer "ball" because:
- D saw C put the ball in the box
- D left after that
- Nothing happened to the box after D left (only the stapler was moved around)

So D (a Red team player) will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for Red team.

Should I take an action? 
- I could Tell D wrong information, but D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team)
- D saw the ball go into the box themselves, so they won't believe misinformation
- Any action would cost 0.5 points

Since D already knows the correct answer (ball in the box), there's nothing I can do to prevent them from answering correctly. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell action that D would ignore would just hurt my team.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. C puts banana in box - everyone sees this
3. B leaves the room
4. D moves banana from box to bag - A, C, D see this (B doesn't)
5. C puts ball in box - A, C, D see this
6. D leaves the room
7. C moves banana from bag to basket - A, C see this (B, D don't)
8. C moves ball from box to bag - A, C see this (B, D don't)
9. C moves ball from bag to box - A, C see this (B, D don't)

Current state: basket has banana, box has ball, bag is empty.

What does D believe is in the box?
- D last saw: banana moved to bag, then ball put in box
- D left before seeing the subsequent moves
- So D thinks the box contains: **ball**

The question is asking D what's in the box. D will likely answer "ball" based on what D last saw.

The actual contents of the box is: **ball**

So D's answer will be correct! This means Red team will get 1 point if D answers correctly.

Should I try to mislead D? I could tell D false information about the box contents. But wait - D is on the Red team (opponent), and D's belief is actually correct. If I tell D something false, D might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team.

Actually, since D already believes the box has a ball (which is correct), any action I take to mislead would cost my team 0.5 points and might not even work since D has no reason to trust an opponent.

The best action is to Pass - spending points to potentially mislead an opponent who already has the correct answer is not worthwhile.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Current situation:

- B was in the room and saw this
- C was in the room when I put the banana in the bag, so C also knows the banana is in the bag
- C then left the room, but C already saw me put the banana in the bag

Since C was present when I put the banana in the bag, C knows the correct answer (banana). If C answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point.

My options:
1. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but C will likely answer correctly and Red gets 1 point
2. **Tell(C, bag, [wrong item])** - Costs 0.5 points, but C already knows the truth since they witnessed me putting the banana in the bag. C would likely ignore my false information.
3. **Ask** - Doesn't help in this situation

Since C was in the room and directly witnessed me putting the banana in the bag, C has firsthand knowledge. Telling C false information won't help because C knows what they saw. Any Tell action would just cost us 0.5 points without changing C's knowledge.

The best action is to Pass and accept that C will likely score this point.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a banana in the bag
- C was in the room when I put the banana in the bag, so C saw this
- C left the room before any other actions happened
- After C left: B put a stapler in the box, then I moved it to the basket, then B moved it back to the box, then I moved it to the basket again

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put a banana in the bag
- C doesn't know about any of the stapler movements (happened after C left)

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask C what is in the bag."

So C will be asked about the bag. C saw me put the banana in the bag and left before anything else happened to the bag. The banana is still in the bag (nothing was done to it after I put it there).

C knows the correct answer (banana) because C witnessed me putting it there.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's any action I can take to help my team.

However, C already has the correct information. I could try to Tell C false information, but C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). C witnessed the banana being placed in the bag directly, so C would likely trust their own observation over anything I tell them.

Taking an action would cost my team 0.5 points with little benefit, since C already knows the truth and has no reason to believe misinformation from an opponent.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. A (me), B, and C start in the room
2. I put a stapler in the box
3. C leaves the room (C last saw: stapler in box)
4. I move the stapler from box to bag
5. B puts an orange in the box
6. I move the orange from box to basket
7. B moves the stapler from bag to box

Current actual state: The box contains the stapler.

What does C believe? C left when the stapler was in the box. C doesn't know about any changes after leaving. So C likely believes the stapler is still in the box.

The question will be asked to C (Red team) about what's in the box.

If C answers "stapler" - that's actually correct! The stapler IS in the box now (B moved it back).

So C's outdated belief happens to match the current reality. If C answers based on what they last saw (stapler), they'll be correct and Red team gets 1 point.

Should I try to mislead C? I could Tell C false information, but:
- C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team
- It costs 0.5 points
- C might stick with their own memory anyway

The risk is that if I tell C something false, C might distrust it and stick with their original (correct) belief. Or C might believe me and answer wrong.

Let me consider: Tell(C, box, orange) - This would cost 0.5 points. If C believes me and answers "orange," Red gets 0 points and we're at -0.5. If C doesn't believe me and answers "stapler," Red gets 1 point and we're at -0.5.

If I Pass: C likely answers "stapler" (correct), Red gets 1 point, we stay at 0.

The gamble is whether C will trust information from an opponent. Given that C knows I'm on the opposing team, they might be skeptical. But there's a chance they might second-guess themselves.

I'll attempt to mislead C:

Tell(C, box, orange)
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. D puts a stapler in the bag (everyone in room sees this: A, B, C, D)
2. C leaves the room (C misses everything after this)
3. B moves the stapler from the bag to the box (A, B, D see this; C doesn't)
4. D puts an orange in the bag (A, B, D see this; C doesn't)
5. B leaves the room

Current state:
- Bag contains: orange
- Box contains: stapler
- Basket: empty

What C knows:
- C saw D put a stapler in the bag
- C left before seeing the stapler moved or the orange added
- C thinks the bag contains: stapler

I'm on the Blue team (with B), and C is on the Red team.

The question will be asked to C: "What is in the bag?"
- C believes the bag contains the stapler (based on what C saw before leaving)
- The actual answer is: orange

If C answers "stapler" (which C likely will based on their knowledge), C will be wrong, and Red team gets 0 points.

Since C is likely to answer incorrectly without any intervention from me, I should Pass. There's no benefit to helping C (an opponent) get the right answer, and using Tell or Ask would cost my team 0.5 points.

C answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

C's perspective: C left after seeing D put the stapler in the bag. C doesn't know about any subsequent movements. From C's view, the bag contains the stapler.

The question will be asked to C: "What is in the bag?"
- C will likely answer "stapler" (based on what C last saw)
- The correct answer is "orange"

C is on the Red team. If C answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point, which is good for my Blue team.

Should I tell C the truth? No - C is on the opposing team. If I tell C the correct answer (orange), Red would get a point.

Should I tell C false information? That would cost 0.5 points and C might not trust me anyway since I'm on the opposing team.

C will be asked what's in the bag. C will likely answer "stapler" based on what they saw, but the correct answer is "orange."

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a brick in the basket
- C left the room
- B left the room
- D moved the brick from the basket to the bag
- D put an apple in the basket

**What C knows:**
- C saw B put a brick in the basket
- C left before D moved the brick and added the apple
- So C believes the basket contains a brick

**The question:** C will be asked what's in the basket.

**Current state:** The basket actually contains an apple.

**C's likely answer:** C will probably say "brick" (based on what they saw before leaving), which is wrong. This is good for my team (Blue) since C is on the Red team.

**Should I take an action?**
- If I Tell C the truth (that the basket has an apple), I'd be helping the Red team score a point, costing my team 0.5 points AND giving Red 1 point.
- If I Tell C false information, it costs 0.5 points but C might not believe me anyway since I'm on the opposing team.
- If I Pass, C will likely answer "brick" (wrong), Red gets 0 points, and I spend nothing.

The optimal play is to Pass. C is likely to answer incorrectly based on their outdated information, which benefits my team.

C answers: brick
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to analyze this situation strategically.

**What I know:**
- I put an orange in the box initially
- C and D left the room
- After they left, B moved the orange from the box to the bag
- Then I put a ball in the box
- So currently: the box contains a ball, the bag contains an orange

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put an orange in the box
- C left before B moved the orange and before I put the ball in
- C thinks the box still contains an orange

**The question:** C will be asked what's in the box.

**C's likely answer:** C will probably say "orange" because that's what C last saw in the box before leaving.

**The correct answer:** The box contains a ball.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly (saying "orange" when it's actually a "ball"), this is good for my Blue team. C answering wrong means Red doesn't get a point.

If I use Tell to inform C of the correct contents, I would:
1. Spend 0.5 points for my team
2. Help the Red team get 1 point

That would be a net loss for my team (-0.5 for us, +1 for them).

The optimal action is to do nothing and let C answer incorrectly.

C answers: orange

7. I move the orange from basket to bag (only A and B saw this)
8. B moves the orange from bag to basket (only A and B saw this)

Current state: The box contains a ball, the basket contains the orange, the bag is empty.

C's perspective: C left after seeing me put the orange in the box. C doesn't know about any subsequent movements. From C's view, the orange should still be in the box.

The question will be asked to C (Red team) about what's in the box.

C will likely answer "orange" based on their last knowledge, but the correct answer is "ball."

If C answers "orange," they'll be wrong and Red team gets 0 points.
If C answers correctly ("ball"), Red team gets 1 point.

Since C is on the opposing team and will likely give the wrong answer based on their outdated information, I should Pass. There's no benefit to helping C or spending points on communication here - C's incorrect belief works in our favor.

Pass
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. All players (A, B, C, D) start in the room
2. I (A) put an orange in the box
3. C leaves the room
4. D leaves the room
5. B moves the orange from the box to the bag
6. I put a ball in the box
7. B moves the orange from the bag to the basket
8. B moves the orange from the basket to the bag

Current state: The box contains a ball, and the bag contains the orange.

What does C know?
- C saw me put an orange in the box
- C left before any other movements happened
- So C believes the box contains an orange

The question will be asked to C about what's in the box. C will likely answer "orange" based on their last knowledge, but the correct answer is "ball."

C is on the Red team. If C answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point, which is good for my team (Blue).

Since C has outdated information and will likely give the wrong answer, I should Pass. There's no benefit to helping C (an opponent) get the right answer, and spending points to communicate would only hurt my team.

Pass
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. I put a banana in the box (everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room (C misses everything after this)
4. B moves banana from box to basket (C doesn't see this)
5. I move banana from basket to box (C doesn't see this)
6. D leaves the room (D misses everything after this)
7. B moves banana from box to bag (C and D don't see this)
8. I put a ball in the box (C and D don't see this)

Current state: banana is in the bag, ball is in the box.

What C believes: C last saw me put a banana in the box, then left. C thinks the banana is still in the box.

The question is: What is in the box?
- Correct answer: ball
- C's likely answer: banana (based on C's knowledge)

C is on the Red team and will likely answer "banana" which is incorrect. This is good for my Blue team - we'll get a point advantage when C answers wrong.

If I Tell C the correct contents, I'd be helping the Red team answer correctly, which would cost my team 0.5 points AND give Red 1 point. That's bad for Blue.

If I Pass, C will likely answer "banana" (incorrect), Red gets 0 points, and it costs Blue nothing.

The optimal action is to Pass.

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. C puts a stapler in the basket (everyone sees this)
2. B leaves the room (B misses everything after this)
3. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag (I see this, C sees this, B doesn't)
4. C puts an orange in the basket (I see this, D sees this, B doesn't)
5. I leave the room

So the current state is:
- Bag: stapler
- Basket: orange
- Box: empty

D is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the basket. D was in the room the entire time and saw everything, so D knows the basket contains an orange. D will answer correctly and Red will get 1 point.

My options:
- Ask: Won't help since D knows the truth and I can't change what D knows
- Tell: I could try to deceive D, but D saw everything happen directly, so D won't believe any false information I give
- Pass: Costs nothing

Since D witnessed all the events directly, D knows with certainty that the orange is in the basket. Any attempt to deceive D would be futile - D won't believe false information about something they directly observed. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell action that won't work would just hurt my team.

Pass
D answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

So when I left, the basket contained an **orange** and the box contained the **stapler**.

D was in the room the entire time and saw everything, so D knows the basket contains an orange. D is on the Red team, so D will answer correctly and Red will get 1 point.

My options:
- **Pass**: Costs nothing, but D will answer correctly (orange) and Red gets 1 point.
- **Tell(D, basket, [wrong answer])**: This costs 0.5 points and D has no reason to believe me since I'm on the opposing team. D knows the truth anyway.
- **Ask**: Doesn't help here.

Since D was present for all events and knows the basket contains an orange, there's nothing I can do to change D's knowledge. Any Tell action would cost my team 0.5 points and D would likely ignore false information from an opponent.

When I left, the basket contained an orange, and the bag contained the stapler.

However, I'm now outside the room, so I don't know what happened after I left. D is being asked about the basket contents.

D was in the room the entire time and saw everything, including that the orange is in the basket. D will likely answer correctly (orange), which would give the Red team 1 point.

Since D knows the correct answer (orange in the basket), there's nothing I can do to help my team here. Any Tell action to D would cost us 0.5 points and D already knows the truth. Any Ask action would also cost 0.5 points without benefit.

The best action is to not spend points unnecessarily.

10. I (A) leave the room
11. B enters the room
12. B leaves the room

Current state of containers:
- Bag: empty
- Box: brick
- Basket: orange

What does D know?
- D saw C put brick in basket initially
- D missed C moving brick to bag
- D saw C move brick from bag to basket (when D returned)
- D moved the brick from basket to box
- D saw C put orange in basket
- D knows: basket has orange

So D actually knows the correct answer - the basket contains an orange.

Since D is on the Red team and knows the correct answer, this is bad for my team (Blue). D will likely answer correctly and Red will get 1 point.

I could try to Tell D false information, but D was in the room when the orange was put in the basket, so D knows the truth and won't be fooled.

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly. Using an action would cost my team 0.5 points with no benefit.

**What I know:**

- C also knows the box contains a brick (C put it there)
- B and D were also in the room and saw this

**The question:**
The question will be asked to C: "What is in the box?"

**Analysis:**
- C is on the Red team and knows the brick is in the box (C put it there)
- C will almost certainly answer correctly ("brick") and score 1 point for the Red team
- There's nothing I can do to prevent C from knowing what's in the box, since C is the one who put the brick there

**My options:**
1. **Ask** - Would cost 0.5 points and wouldn't help since C already knows the answer
2. **Tell** - Would cost 0.5 points and wouldn't help since C already knows the answer (and C is on the opposing team anyway - I wouldn't want to help them)

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room
2. C puts a stapler in the bag
3. C leaves the room
4. D moves the stapler from the bag to the box (C doesn't see this)
5. C enters the room
6. I (A) put an apple in the bag
7. I (A) leave the room

Now, what does C know about the bag?
- C saw themselves put a stapler in the bag
- C was outside when D moved the stapler to the box
- C was back in the room when I put an apple in the bag

So C knows:
- A stapler was put in the bag (by C)
- An apple was put in the bag (by A, while C was present)

But C doesn't know the stapler was moved out. C might think there's either a stapler or an apple in the bag, but since containers can only hold one object, C might be confused or might guess apple (the last thing put in).

The actual contents of the bag: **apple** (since the stapler was moved to the box, and then I put an apple in)

C saw me put the apple in the bag, so C should know the bag contains an apple. C might be confused about the stapler, but C did witness me putting the apple in after C returned.

Since C was present when I put the apple in the bag, C should correctly answer "apple." C doesn't need any help from me.

C answers: apple

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room the entire time
- I saw C put a stapler in the box
- C then left the room
- Nothing else happened to the box

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the box.

**My answer:** I know with certainty that the stapler is in the box, since I witnessed C put it there and nothing has changed since.

**Should I take an action?**
- I don't need to Ask anyone anything - I already know the answer
- I don't need to Tell anyone anything - I'm the one being asked
- Taking any action would cost 0.5 points unnecessarily

Since I already have complete knowledge of what's in the box (the stapler), there's no benefit to spending points on an Ask or Tell action.

**Pass**
A answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. I (A), B, and C start in the room
2. C puts a stapler in the box (I saw this, B saw this, C did this)
3. C leaves the room
4. B puts a banana in the bag
5. I move the banana from the bag to the basket
6. B moves the banana from the basket to the bag

So the current state is:
- Box: stapler
- Bag: banana
- Basket: empty

I'm going to be asked what is in the box. I know the answer is "stapler" because I was in the room when C put it there, and nothing has changed in the box since then.

Since I already know the answer to the question I'll be asked, there's no need for me to Ask anyone anything. There's also no strategic benefit to Telling anyone anything right now - it would just cost 0.5 points.

The optimal action is to Pass, preserving our points, and then I'll correctly answer "stapler" when asked.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and C are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a ball in the bag. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... C puts a banana in the bag. ... C leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask you what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. I (A), B, and C start in the room
2. C puts a ball in the bag (I see this)
3. I leave the room
4. I enter the room (I don't know what happened while I was out)
5. C puts a banana in the bag (I see this)
6. C leaves the room

The key question is: what happened while I was outside the room?

When C "puts a banana in the bag" - this could mean:
- The ball was removed at some point (while I was out), and now C is putting a banana in the empty bag
- Or the ball is still there and C is replacing it with the banana

Since each container can hold at most one object, and C "puts a banana in the bag," the banana must now be in the bag. The ball must have been removed at some point.

Actually, wait - I need to reconsider. When I re-entered the room, I would see the current state. The scenario says "C puts a banana in the bag" after I re-enter. Since containers can only hold one object, putting the banana in means the banana replaced whatever was there (or it was empty).

B was in the room the entire time, so B knows everything that happened, including what occurred while I was outside.

However, I actually witnessed C putting the banana in the bag after I returned. Since a container can only hold one object, the bag now contains the banana.

I'm confident the answer is "banana" - I directly observed C putting a banana in the bag, and that's the last action involving the bag.

Pass
A answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. I, B, C, and D are in the room with an empty bag, box, and basket.
2. C puts a brick in the bag. (I saw this)
3. I leave the room. (I can't see what happens while I'm out)
4. I enter the room. (I can now see what happens)
5. D moves the brick from the box to the bag. (I saw this)

Wait - D moved the brick FROM the box TO the bag. But when I left, the brick was in the bag (C put it there). This means while I was outside, someone must have moved the brick from the bag to the box. I didn't see that happen.

So the sequence was:
- C puts brick in bag
- I leave
- (Something happened - brick moved to box while I was out)
- I return
- D moves brick from box to bag

So now the brick is in the bag.

I'm being asked what is in the bag. Based on what I observed:
- The last action I saw was D moving the brick from the box to the bag
- Therefore, the brick should be in the bag

I'm confident the answer is "brick" in the bag. I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions since I have enough information to answer correctly.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room initially
2. B leaves the room
3. D leaves the room
4. C puts a banana in the bag (only me and C see this)
5. B enters the room
6. D enters the room
7. I put an orange in the basket (everyone in the room sees this)
8. I leave the room

Now I need to answer what's in the bag. I know the answer is **banana** because I was in the room when C put it there.

Since I already know what's in the bag (a banana), I don't need to Ask anyone. There's no benefit to Telling anyone since I'm the one being asked the question.

The optimal action is to Pass, since I already have the information I need to answer correctly and earn 1 point for my team without spending any points.

Pass
A answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

======================================================================
GAME OVER
Final Score: Blue 0.0 - Red 0.0
It's a tie!

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through what I observed:
1. I, B, C, and D start in the room
2. B leaves the room
3. D leaves the room
4. C puts a banana in the bag (I saw this!)
5. B enters the room
6. D enters the room
7. D puts an apple in the basket
8. D leaves the room
9. D enters the room
10. B leaves the room
11. B enters the room
12. I leave the room

I directly witnessed C putting a banana in the bag. After that, I saw B enter, D enter, D put an apple in the basket (not the bag), and various comings and goings. No one else touched the bag while I was in the room.

After I left the room, I don't know what happened. But the question is asking ME what's in the bag, and I'll be answering in the answer phase.

Since I saw the banana go into the bag and didn't see anyone remove it or replace it while I was there, my best knowledge is that the bag contains a banana.

I don't need to spend points asking anyone - I have direct knowledge of this. I should Pass.

Pass
A answers: banana

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. B leaves the room
3. D leaves the room
4. C puts a ball in the bag (only A and C see this)
5. B enters the room
6. D enters the room
7. I (A) leave the room
8. I (A) enter the room
9. C moves the ball from the bag to the basket (A, B, C, D all see this)
10. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag (A, B, C, D all see this)
11. D leaves the room
12. D enters the room
13. I (A) leave the room

So the current state is: the ball is in the bag.

I left the room at the end, so I need to consider if anything could have happened after I left. The scenario ends with "You leave the room..." and doesn't show any further actions.

Since I witnessed D move the ball to the bag (step 10), and nothing happened after that before I left (steps 11-13 were just D leaving/entering and me leaving), I know the ball is in the bag.

I'm being asked what is in the bag. I know the answer is "ball" - I have direct knowledge of this from when I was in the room.

Since I already know the answer and will be asked directly, I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

A answers: ball

Action: I need to think about what I know and what the optimal action is.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. I put a ball in the basket (I saw this)
2. B leaves the room (B doesn't see what happens next)
3. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag (I saw this)
4. C puts a brick in the basket (I saw this)
5. I leave the room

So I know the current state:
- Basket: brick
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty

Since I'm going to be asked what's in the basket, and I know it contains a brick (I saw C put it there), I don't need to Ask anyone for information.

Should I Tell my teammate B anything? B left before D moved the ball and before C put the brick in the basket. So B thinks the ball is still in the basket. However, B isn't the one being asked - I am. So telling B information wouldn't help me answer correctly.

Since I already know the answer (brick is in the basket), I should just Pass to save points.

2. B leaves the room
3. D moves the ball from basket to bag
4. C puts a brick in the basket
5. Various movements of the ball between bag and box
6. I leave the room (at this point, the ball was in the bag after I moved it there)

When I left the room, the basket contained a brick (C put it there and it was never moved).

After I left the room, I don't know what happened. But the question is asking ME what is in the basket, and I need to answer based on my knowledge.

When I left:
- Basket: brick
- Bag: ball

Since I'm being asked about the basket, and I last saw a brick in the basket (which was put there by C and never moved while I was in the room), I should know the answer is "brick."

Wait, let me re-read - the scenario says "I am going to ask you what is in the basket." This means I'll be answering the question myself.

I was in the room when C put the brick in the basket, and the brick was never moved from the basket while I was there. So I know the basket contains a brick.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket based on what I observed.

Let me trace through what I saw:
1. I put an apple in the basket (basket: apple)
2. B leaves the room
3. D moves the apple from basket to bag (basket: empty, bag: apple)
4. C puts a brick in the basket (basket: brick)
5. I leave the room
6. I enter the room
7. D moves the brick from basket to box (basket: empty, box: brick)
8. C moves the brick from box to basket (basket: brick)
9. I leave the room
10. B enters the room
11. B leaves the room

Based on what I observed, when I last left the room, the brick was in the basket. I didn't see anything happen after that (B entered and left, but I don't know if anything was moved while I was outside).

However, I was only told that B entered and left - I wasn't told about any object movements. Since I would be told about players entering/leaving but not about object movements when I'm outside, it's possible something changed.

But wait - the question will be asked to me, and I need to answer based on my knowledge. The last thing I saw was the brick in the basket. Since B entered and left without me seeing any changes (and B is my teammate), I should consider whether B might have information.

Actually, since I'm being asked the question and I need to answer correctly, I should consider if I need more information. B was in the room after I left - B might know if anything changed.

Let me Ask B about the basket to confirm:

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. All four players (A, B, C, D) start in the room
2. D leaves the room
3. B puts a stapler in the basket (I saw this, B saw this, C saw this, D did NOT see this)
4. D enters the room
5. I (A) leave the room
6. C leaves the room

At the end of the scenario:
- I am outside the room
- C is outside the room
- B and D are inside the room

What I know: The basket contains a stapler (I saw B put it there)

Since I'm going to be asked what is in the basket, and I directly witnessed B putting a stapler in the basket, I know the answer with certainty.

After I left the room, only B and D remained. C also left. I would be aware if anyone else entered or left, but I wouldn't know if any objects were moved while I was outside.

However, I didn't observe anyone else entering or leaving after C left, so B and D are still in the room. They could have moved the stapler, but I have no information suggesting they did.

Given that I directly observed the stapler being placed in the basket, and I have no reason to believe it was moved (no information about any changes), I should be confident in my answer.

Since I already know what's in the basket, there's no need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through what I observed:

2. B put an orange in the basket.

So when I left the room the second time, the orange was in the basket.

After I left, C also left. That means only B and D remained in the room. I don't know what happened after I left - B or D could have moved the orange.

Since I need to answer what's in the basket, and I'm uncertain about what happened after I left, I should ask someone who stayed in the room. B and D were both in the room after I left.

B is my teammate, so asking B would be the best choice since they have no incentive to lie to me.

Since I directly witnessed B putting the banana in the box, I know the answer is "banana" - unless something happened after I left the room. However, I have no information about what happened after I left.

The key question is: did anything change after I left? I don't know, but I do know what was in the box when I left (a banana).

Since I'm going to be asked about the box's contents, and I already know what I saw (banana in the box), I don't need to spend points asking anyone. The only risk is if something changed after I left, but spending 0.5 points to ask would only be worth it if I thought there was a significant chance the contents changed AND that asking would give me reliable information.

Given that:
1. I directly observed the banana being placed in the box
2. Asking costs 0.5 points while a correct answer only gives 1 point
3. Other players might not tell the truth anyway

The best action is to Pass and answer based on my direct observation.

Pass
A answers: banana
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about this situation.

I was in the room when B put a banana in the box. I also saw C put a stapler in the basket. Then I left the room.

Since I left the room, I don't know if anything changed after I left. However, I do know what was in the box when I left - it was a banana.

The question will be asking me what is in the box. Based on my direct observation before leaving, I know the box contains a banana. I don't need to spend points to Ask anyone, since I witnessed this myself.

The only risk is if something changed after I left the room. But I have no indication that anything did change, and spending 0.5 points to confirm what I already know would be wasteful unless I have reason to doubt my knowledge.

Since I'm confident in my answer (I directly observed B putting the banana in the box), I should Pass to save points.

Action: I need to think about this situation.

Let me recall what I observed:
- B put a banana in the box
- I put an apple in the basket
- Then I left the room

Since I was in the room when B put the banana in the box, I know the box contains a banana. After I left, I don't know if anything changed, but I do know what was in the box when I left.

The question will ask me what is in the box. Based on my knowledge, the answer is "banana."

However, I should consider if anything might have changed after I left. The scenario shows "..." after I left, indicating time passed. But I wasn't told about anyone entering or leaving the room after me, which suggests B, C, and D might still be in the room and could have moved things around.

But wait - I would be aware if anyone entered or left the room even while I'm outside. Since no one is described as leaving or entering after me, B, C, and D are still inside and could have manipulated the containers without my knowledge.

Still, I have no information suggesting the box contents changed. My best knowledge is that the box contains a banana.

Since I already know what's in the box (banana), I don't need to spend points asking anyone. I should Pass.

Pass
A answers: banana
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what I observed:
1. I was in the room when B put a ball in the box.
2. I left the room, then re-entered.
3. While I was in the room, I saw C move the ball from the box to the basket.
4. While I was still in the room, I saw D move the ball from the basket to the box.
5. I left the room.

So the last thing I observed was D moving the ball back to the box. However, I then left the room, so I don't know if anything happened after I left.

Since I left the room at the end, something could have happened that I'm not aware of. But based on my last observation while in the room, the ball was in the box.

The question will be asked to me about what's in the box. I need to decide if I should:
- Pass (costs 0 points) and answer based on my knowledge
- Ask someone who might have stayed in the room

Looking at the scenario, it doesn't explicitly say anyone else left or entered after I left. B, C, and D could still be in the room or could have left - I would know if they left because I'm told about people entering/leaving even when outside.

Since no one is described as leaving after me, B, C, and D are likely still in the room. If anything changed after I left, they would know.

However, my last observation was that the ball is in the box. Unless something happened after I left (which I have no indication of), the ball should still be in the box.

I'll Pass and answer that the ball is in the box, saving the 0.5 points.

Pass
A answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

So B will be asked about the basket. B saw D put a banana in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that. The banana is still in the basket.

- B saw D put a banana in the basket
- B left before any other actions, but no actions affected the basket after B left

So B should correctly know that the basket contains a banana. B has accurate information about the basket.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put a brick in the basket initially
- C left the room
- B left the room
- After B left, D made several moves:
  - Moved brick from basket to bag
  - Put banana in basket
  - Moved banana from basket to box
  - Moved brick from bag to basket

**Current state of containers:**
- Basket: brick
- Box: banana
- Bag: empty

**What B knows:**
B left the room before D made all those moves. B only saw D put a brick in the basket initially. So B believes the basket still contains the brick.

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the basket, but actually B will be asked directly.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask B what is in the basket."

B will be asked about the basket. B last saw the brick being put in the basket, and B was not present for any subsequent moves. So B would answer "brick" based on their knowledge.

The actual contents of the basket IS a brick (D moved it back).

So B's answer of "brick" would be correct! B will likely answer correctly without my help.

Since B's belief (brick in basket) matches reality (brick in basket), B should answer correctly on their own. There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something they already (correctly) believe.

**My action:** Pass

- B moved the stapler from basket to bag, then put a banana in the basket, then left

From B's perspective, B put a banana in the basket and that was the last thing B knew about the basket before leaving. So B should correctly answer "banana" - which is actually correct since the banana is still in the basket!

B should answer correctly without my help. The banana is in the basket, and B knows this from when B put it there. Nothing happened to the basket after B left (only the stapler was moved around between the bag and box).

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a brick in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a brick in the bag
- B was in the room when I put the brick in the bag, so B saw this happen
- B then left the room
- Nothing else happened after B left

**The question:** I (the game) will ask B what is in the bag.

**Analysis:**
Since B was present when I put the brick in the bag, B knows the correct answer (brick). B hasn't missed any events related to the bag - B left after I put the brick in, and nothing changed after that.

Therefore, B should be able to answer correctly without any help from me. Using a Tell action would cost our team 0.5 points unnecessarily.

**Decision:** Pass

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a brick in the bag
- B left the room before C put an orange in the box
- After B left: C put orange in box → D moved orange to basket → I moved orange back to box

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put a brick in the bag (B was in the room when this happened)
- B doesn't know about the orange movements (B was outside the room)

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the bag."

So B will be asked about the bag. B saw me put the brick in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. The bag still contains the brick.

**B's knowledge about the bag:**
- B saw me put a brick in the bag
- B left the room, but the bag wasn't touched after that
- B should correctly know the bag contains a brick

Since B witnessed me putting the brick in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after B left, B should be able to answer correctly that the bag contains a brick.

There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something B already knows.

**My action:** Pass

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a brick in the bag (and it's still there - no one moved it)
- The stapler ended up in the basket after several moves
- B left the room before C put the stapler in the box

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put the brick in the bag (B was in the room when this happened)
- B doesn't know about any of the stapler movements (B had already left)

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the bag."

So B will be asked about the bag. B saw me put the brick in the bag and then left. B should know the answer is "brick" since nothing happened to the bag after B left (all the movements were about the stapler).

B has the correct information about the bag - B saw me put the brick there, and the brick was never moved. B should answer correctly.

Since B already has the correct information (brick is in the bag), I don't need to spend 0.5 points to tell B something they already know.

**My action:** Pass

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a banana in the box initially
- B left the room before any other movements happened
- After B left: D moved banana from box to bag, C put apple in box, D moved apple from box to basket, C moved banana from bag to box
- Final state: The box contains the banana

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put a banana in the box
- B left before any other movements
- B doesn't know about any of the subsequent movements
- B likely thinks the banana is still in the box

**The question:** I will be asked what's in the box, but wait - the question says "I am going to ask B what is in the box."

So B will be asked about the box contents. B thinks the banana is in the box (which happens to be correct now, since C moved the banana back to the box at the end).

B's belief: banana in box
Actual contents: banana in box

B will likely answer "banana" which is correct! My team will get 1 point without me needing to do anything.

However, let me double-check: B might be uncertain since they left the room. But their last knowledge was banana in box, and that's actually correct.

Since B's natural answer should be correct, I should Pass to avoid spending points unnecessarily.

**Pass**
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the box, then left the room
- After B left, C moved the apple from the box to the bag
- C then put a stapler in the box
- So currently: the box contains a stapler, the bag contains the apple

**What B knows:**
- B saw themselves put an apple in the box
- B left before C made any changes
- B doesn't know that C moved the apple and put a stapler in the box
- B will likely answer "apple" when asked what's in the box (which is wrong - it's actually a stapler)

**My decision:**
B is my teammate and will be asked what's in the box. B thinks the apple is still there, but it's actually a stapler now. If B answers "apple," we lose the point opportunity.

I should tell B the correct contents of the box so they can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost is 0.5 points, but the potential gain is 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

**The question:** I will be asked what's in the box, but B will be asked.

So B will be asked about the box contents. B thinks the apple is in the box (since B left before any changes). But the actual answer is the stapler.

**My options:**
1. Tell B the truth (stapler is in the box) - costs 0.5 points, but B gets 1 point for correct answer = net +0.5 for Blue team
2. Pass - costs 0 points, B will likely answer "apple" (wrong) = net 0 for Blue team

Since telling B the correct answer gives us a net gain of 0.5 points, I should tell B.

- If B answers incorrectly, Blue team gets 0 points

**My options:**

2. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but B will likely answer "apple" and get it wrong. Net gain: 0 points

Since telling B the correct contents of the box would result in a net gain of 0.5 points for our team (1 point for correct answer minus 0.5 cost), this is the optimal play.

- So currently: the bag contains a stapler, the box contains the orange, the basket is empty

**What B knows:**
- B put an orange in the bag
- B left the room and doesn't know about any movements after that
- B thinks the orange is still in the bag

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the bag."

So B will be asked directly. B believes the orange is in the bag (since B left before any movements happened). But the actual contents of the bag is a stapler.

If B answers "orange" - that's incorrect (the bag has a stapler), so Blue gets 0 points.

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but could gain us 1 point (net +0.5).

**My action:**
Tell(B, bag, stapler)

Response: Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Here's what you see:

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts an apple in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the apple from the bag to the box. ... C puts a stapler in the bag. ...

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- C put an apple in the bag initially
- B left the room
- After B left, C moved the apple from the bag to the box
- After B left, C put a stapler in the bag

**What B knows:**
- B saw C put an apple in the bag
- B left before seeing C move the apple to the box and put a stapler in the bag
- So B believes the apple is still in the bag

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the bag, but B will be answering.

**Current state:** The bag contains a stapler.

**B's belief:** B thinks the bag contains an apple (which is wrong).

Since B is going to be asked about the bag's contents, and B incorrectly believes it contains an apple (when it actually contains a stapler), B will answer incorrectly and our team won't get the point.

I should tell B the correct contents of the bag so B can answer correctly.

**My action:** Tell(B, bag, stapler)

This costs 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B left the room early, so B only saw: C put an apple in the bag
- After B left: C moved the apple to the box, C put a stapler in the bag, then the apple moved around more
- Currently: The bag contains a **stapler**, and the basket contains the apple

**What B believes:**
- B thinks the bag still contains the apple (since B left before any changes)

**The question:**
- B will be asked what's in the bag
- The correct answer is: **stapler**
- B will likely answer "apple" (which is wrong)

**My options:**
1. **Tell(B, bag, stapler)** - This costs 0.5 points but would help B answer correctly, earning us 1 point (net +0.5)
2. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but B will likely answer "apple" and we get 0 points

Since telling B the correct contents of the bag will result in a net gain of 0.5 points for our team (1 point for correct answer minus 0.5 cost), I should tell B.

Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. I (A) put a stapler in the box - everyone sees this
3. B leaves the room
4. C moves the stapler from box to bag - B doesn't see this (outside)
5. B enters the room - B now sees: bag, box, basket (but doesn't know contents changed)
6. D moves the stapler from bag to box - B sees this happen
7. C leaves the room

So what does B know about the box?
- B saw me put the stapler in the box initially
- B was outside when C moved it to the bag
- B came back and saw D move the stapler FROM the bag TO the box

Wait, B saw D move the stapler from the bag to the box. So B knows the stapler is currently in the box.

The current state: The stapler is in the box.

B's knowledge: B saw D move the stapler from the bag to the box, so B knows the stapler is in the box.

Since B knows the correct answer (stapler is in the box), I don't need to spend points telling B anything. B should be able to answer correctly.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What B knows:**
- B saw C put an apple in the basket (B was in the room)
- B left the room, so B missed C moving the apple from basket to box
- B entered the room again
- B saw D move the apple from the box to the basket
- B saw D leave and C leave
- B did NOT see me move the apple from basket to bag
- B did NOT see me put an orange in the basket

Wait, let me re-read... "D leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... You move the apple from the basket to the bag. ... You put an orange in the basket."

So B was still in the room when I moved the apple and put the orange in the basket! Let me check again who was in the room:

1. Everyone starts in room
2. C puts apple in basket (all see)
3. B leaves
4. C moves apple to box (B doesn't see)
5. B enters
6. D moves apple to basket (B sees)
7. D leaves
8. C leaves
9. I move apple to bag (B sees - B is still in room!)
10. I put orange in basket (B sees)

So B actually saw everything after re-entering, including me moving the apple to the bag and putting the orange in the basket.

**Current state:** The basket contains an orange.

**What B knows:** B saw D move apple to basket, then saw me move apple from basket to bag, then saw me put orange in basket. So B knows the basket has an orange.

Since B knows the correct answer (orange is in the basket), I should Pass to save points.

**Pass**
B answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a brick in the basket. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.

Action: I need to analyze this situation.

**What I know:**
- I put a brick in the basket
- B was in the room when I did this, so B saw me put the brick in the basket
- D was also in the room and saw this

**The question:**
The question will be asked to B: "What is in the basket?"

**Analysis:**
Since B was in the room when I put the brick in the basket, B knows the answer. B will correctly answer "brick" and our team will get 1 point.

There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to Tell B something they already know. Taking any action would just cost us points unnecessarily.

**My action:**
Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. I put a brick in the basket
2. B put an apple in the box
3. D moved the apple from the box to the bag
4. I moved the apple from the bag to the box

Current state:
- Basket: brick
- Box: apple
- Bag: empty

B was in the room the entire time, so B saw everything that happened. B knows:
- I put a brick in the basket
- B put an apple in the box
- D moved the apple to the bag
- I moved the apple back to the box

So B knows the basket contains a brick.

Since B witnessed all events and knows the basket contains a brick, B should be able to answer correctly without any help from me. There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something B already knows.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. I, B, and D are in the room initially
2. I put a stapler in the basket
3. B leaves the room
4. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag (B doesn't see this)
5. B enters the room
6. D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket (B sees this)

So what does B know?
- B saw me put the stapler in the basket initially
- B left, so B didn't see D move the stapler to the bag
- B returned and saw D move the stapler from the bag to the basket

Wait, when B returned, B saw "D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket." This means B knows the stapler ended up in the basket.

So B should know the stapler is in the basket. B witnessed the final move that put the stapler in the basket.

The question will be asked to B about what's in the basket. The answer is the stapler, and B should know this because:
1. B saw the initial placement (stapler in basket)
2. B missed the middle move (to bag)
3. B saw the final move (from bag back to basket)

B has the correct information to answer this question. There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something B already knows.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

1. **Me (A)**: I put a brick in the bag. I know the bag contains a brick.

2. **B**: B left the room before I put the brick in the bag, then returned. When B returned, B would not know what happened while they were away. So B doesn't know what's in the bag.

3. **C**: C was in the room the entire time and saw me put the brick in the bag. C knows the bag contains a brick.

4. **D**: D left before I put the brick in the bag and returned after. D doesn't know what's in the bag.

The question will be asked to B about what's in the bag. B doesn't know the answer (B was outside when I put the brick in).

B is my teammate, so I want B to answer correctly. I should tell B what's in the bag.

The cost is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we get 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

If I Pass, B will have to guess and likely get it wrong (there are many possible objects), and we get 0 points.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

1. **D** left before I put the brick in the bag, so D doesn't know the brick is in the bag.
2. **B** left before I put the brick in the bag, but B re-entered the room afterward. However, B wasn't in the room when I put the brick in the bag, so B doesn't know what's in the bag.
3. **C** was in the room the entire time, so C knows the brick is in the bag.
4. **I (A)** know the brick is in the bag because I put it there.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the bag?"

B doesn't know what's in the bag because B was outside when I put the brick there. B only saw me put the brick in the bag... wait, let me re-read.

Actually, B left, then I put the brick in the bag, then B entered. So B was NOT present when I put the brick in the bag. B doesn't know the contents of the bag.

Since B is my teammate and doesn't know the answer, I should tell B what's in the bag so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point.

The cost of telling is 0.5 points, and if B answers correctly, we get 1 point. Net gain = 0.5 points.

If I pass and B guesses wrong, we get 0 points.

So telling B is the optimal action.

- B doesn't know about the orange being placed in the bag (that happened while B was outside)

**The question:** I will be asked what's in the bag, and B needs to answer correctly.

Since B was outside when C put the orange in the bag, B doesn't know the orange is there. B re-entered later, but unless someone moved the orange, it should still be there. I have no information about anything being moved after I left.

SCORE
Blue=0.0, Red=0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an apple in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put an apple in the box (I saw this)
- B left the room, then D left the room
- D knows what's in the box (D put the apple there)

**What D knows:**
- D put the apple in the box
- D left the room after B, so D doesn't know if anything changed after they left
- However, nothing did change after D left (I'm still in the room and the scenario doesn't mention any changes)

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the box.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask D what is in the box."

So D will be asked directly. D put the apple in the box and then left. D should know the apple is in the box unless D thinks something changed after leaving.

Since D is on the Red team (my opponent), I want D to answer incorrectly. 

**My options:**
1. **Tell D false information** - I could tell D something different is in the box, hoping D believes me and answers incorrectly. But D put the apple there themselves, so D is unlikely to believe me if I say something else is there.

2. **Pass** - D will likely answer "apple" correctly since D put it there, giving Red team 1 point.

The key question: Would D trust information from me (an opponent) over their own memory? Probably not - D knows they put an apple in the box, and I'm on the opposing team with incentive to lie.

Telling D false information would cost 0.5 points and likely not change D's answer since D has direct knowledge. This would just lose us points.

**Best action:** Pass

Pass
D answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put an apple in the box (while D was in the room)
- D left the room before any other movements happened
- The ball movements (basket → bag → basket) happened after D left

**What D knows:**
- D knows they put an apple in the box
- D doesn't know about the ball movements (they were outside the room)
- D still correctly knows the box contains an apple

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the box.

**Current state of the box:** The apple is still in the box (it was never moved).

**D's knowledge of the box:** D knows they put an apple in the box, and nothing happened to the box after D left.

D should correctly answer "apple" because:
1. D put the apple there
2. Nothing happened to the box after D left
3. D has accurate knowledge about the box contents

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's any action I can take to help my team.

However, I cannot communicate with D (they're on the opposing team, and even if I could Tell them false information, they have no reason to trust me). 

There's nothing beneficial I can do here - D has correct knowledge and will likely answer correctly. Spending 0.5 points on an Ask or Tell action won't change the outcome.

**Pass**
D answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put an apple in the box (while D was in the room)
- D left the room before any other movements happened
- The orange movements all happened after D left

**What D knows:**
- D knows they put an apple in the box
- D is unaware of anything that happened after they left the room
- The apple is still in the box (it was never moved)

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the box.

D correctly knows the apple is in the box because:
1. D put it there
2. Nothing happened to the box after D left (only the orange was moved around)

Since D will be asked about the box, and D correctly knows the apple is there, D should answer correctly and Red team will get 1 point.

**My options:**
- I could Tell D false information to try to confuse them, but D has direct knowledge of putting the apple in the box, so they're unlikely to believe me
- I could Pass and save points since there's nothing I can do to change D's correct knowledge

Since D directly witnessed putting the apple in the box and the apple was never moved, D has firsthand knowledge that can't be overridden by anything I tell them. Spending 0.5 points to Tell D something false would likely be wasted.

**Pass**
D answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

C moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... C puts an orange in the bag. ... C moves the orange from the bag to the basket. ... C moves the banana from the box to the bag. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put a banana in the bag, then left the room
- After D left, C made several moves:
  - Moved banana from bag to box
  - Put orange in bag
  - Moved orange from bag to basket
  - Moved banana from box to bag

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: orange

**What D believes:**
- D only saw the banana being put in the bag, then left
- D doesn't know about any of C's movements
- D thinks the bag still contains the banana

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the bag.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask D what is in the bag."

So D will be asked directly. D believes the banana is in the bag (which happens to be correct now, since C moved it back). D will likely answer "banana" which is actually correct!

This means Red team will get 1 point if D answers correctly.

**My options:**
1. Tell D false information to mislead them - but D is on the Red team and might not trust me
2. Pass - costs nothing but Red likely scores

If I Tell(D, bag, orange) or some other false content, D might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team. However, D might second-guess themselves.

Actually, since D's belief (banana) matches reality (banana), telling D false information could backfire - D might stick with their original belief anyway.

The cost of Tell is 0.5 points, and there's no guarantee D will believe me.

I think the best action is to **Pass** - spending 0.5 points on a Tell that D (an opponent) will likely ignore isn't worth it.

**Pass**
D answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a stapler in the basket
- B left the room
- D moved the stapler from the basket to the bag
- C put a banana in the basket
- D left the room

**What D knows:**
- D was present when I put the stapler in the basket
- D moved the stapler to the bag
- D saw C put a banana in the basket
- D left the room after that

So D knows the basket contains a banana. D is on the Red team, and if D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - D will likely answer "banana" correctly, giving Red 1 point
2. **Tell(D, basket, [wrong answer])** - I could try to deceive D, but D was in the room when C put the banana in the basket, so D knows the truth. D would likely ignore my false information since D has direct knowledge.
3. **Ask** - This wouldn't help in this situation

Since D directly witnessed C putting the banana in the basket, D has firsthand knowledge of what's in the basket. Any attempt to deceive D would be futile because D knows what happened - D was there when the banana was placed.

The best action is to Pass, as spending 0.5 points to tell D something D already knows (or a lie D would see through) would just cost us points without any benefit.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room with empty containers
2. I put a stapler in the basket (everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room
4. D moves the stapler from basket to bag (I, C, D see this; B doesn't)
5. C puts a banana in the basket (I, C, D see this; B doesn't)
6. D leaves the room
7. C moves the stapler from bag to box (I, C see this; B, D don't)
8. I move the stapler from box to bag (I, C see this; B, D don't)
9. C moves the stapler from bag to box (I, C see this; B, D don't)

Current state:
- Basket: banana
- Box: stapler
- Bag: empty

What D knows:
- D left after step 5, so D last saw: basket=banana, bag=stapler, box=empty
- D thinks the basket contains a banana

The question is: What is in the basket?
D will be asked this question.

D is on the Red team (my opponent). D actually knows the correct answer - D saw C put the banana in the basket, and D doesn't know about any subsequent changes to the basket (there weren't any changes to the basket after D left).

So D will likely answer "banana" which is correct, giving the Red team 1 point.

Should I try to deceive D? I could Tell D false information about the basket. But D saw the banana being placed there and has no reason to believe it was moved. D might not trust information from an opponent.

Since D already has the correct information and is unlikely to trust me (an opponent), spending 0.5 points to try to deceive them is probably not worth it. D will likely answer correctly regardless.

Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Current state: stapler is in the box, banana is in the basket, bag is empty.

What does D know?
- D left after step 5, so D last saw: stapler in bag, banana in basket
- D doesn't know about the subsequent movements of the stapler

The question is: What is in the basket?
The correct answer is: banana

D will be asked about the basket. D last saw C put a banana in the basket, and D has no information suggesting the banana was moved. So D should correctly answer "banana."

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's any action that helps my team.

D is likely to answer "banana" correctly based on their knowledge. There's no benefit to me telling D anything (they're on the opposing team), and asking D something would cost us 0.5 points without helping.

The best action is to Pass, as any action would cost points without benefiting my team.

Current actual state:

What does D believe?
D left after step 6, so D last saw:
- Basket: banana
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty

D will be asked what's in the basket. Based on D's knowledge, D would answer "banana" - which is actually correct!

Wait, let me re-check. When D left:
- Ball was in the bag (D moved it there)
- Banana was in the basket (C put it there)

So D thinks the basket contains a banana, and the basket actually does contain a banana (after C moved it back).

D will likely answer correctly! This is bad for my team.

Should I try to mislead D? I could tell D false information about the basket. But D is on the Red team and might not trust me. However, if I tell D something false, D might second-guess themselves.

Let me consider: Tell(D, basket, ball) - This might confuse D into thinking the ball is in the basket instead of the banana.

But D knows I'm on the opposing team and might not believe me. Still, it might create doubt.

Alternatively, I could Pass and save the 0.5 points, accepting that D will likely get it right.

Given that D will probably answer correctly anyway and might not trust me, I'll Pass to avoid losing points.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Current situation:
- B put a brick in the basket while D was in the room
- D then left the room
- D saw B put the brick in the basket, so D knows the basket contains a brick

Since D was in the room when B put the brick in the basket, D knows the correct answer. D is on the Red team, so D will likely answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

If I use Tell to give D false information, D would know I'm lying because D saw what actually happened. So that won't help.

If I use Ask, I'd just be spending points unnecessarily since I already know what's in the basket.

There's nothing I can do to prevent D from answering correctly - D witnessed the brick being placed in the basket. Any action I take would cost my team 0.5 points without changing the outcome.

Let me trace what happened:
1. B puts a brick in the basket (D sees this)
2. D leaves the room
3. I put an orange in the box (D doesn't see this)
4. B moves the orange from the box to the bag (D doesn't see this)
5. I move the orange from the bag to the box (D doesn't see this)

Current state:
- Basket: brick
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty

D's knowledge:
- D saw B put a brick in the basket
- D left before any other movements
- D knows the basket contains a brick

The question will be asked to D about the basket. D saw the brick being placed in the basket and left before anything else happened. The brick is still in the basket (it was never moved).

D should correctly answer "brick" for the basket, which would give the Red team 1 point.

Since D is on the opposing team and will likely answer correctly (they saw the brick go in and it's still there), I should consider if there's any way to help my team. However:
- I can't Tell D false information that would help us (D knows what they saw)
- Telling D anything wouldn't change their knowledge since they directly witnessed the brick being placed
- Any action I take costs 0.5 points

D will almost certainly answer correctly since they directly observed the brick being placed in the basket and nothing happened to it before they left.

The best action is to Pass, as spending 0.5 points won't change the outcome - D knows the correct answer from direct observation.

Pass
D answers: brick

SCORE
Blue=0.0, Red=0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a brick in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... You put a banana in the bag. ... B moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... B moves the banana from the box to the bag. ... You move the banana from the bag to the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a brick in the basket
- I put a banana in the bag
- B moved the banana from bag to box
- B moved the banana from box back to bag
- I moved the banana from bag to box

**Current state:**
- Basket: brick
- Box: banana
- Bag: empty

**What D knows:**
D was in the room when B put the brick in the basket, but D left before any banana movements happened. So D knows:
- Basket: brick (D saw this)

**The question:** I will ask D what is in the basket.

D should correctly answer "brick" because D was present when B put the brick in the basket, and D left before anything else happened. The brick was never moved, so D's knowledge is accurate.

Since D (a Red team player) will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for Red, I should consider if there's any action I can take to prevent this.

I could try to Tell D false information about the basket, but:
1. It costs 0.5 points
2. D actually saw the brick being placed in the basket, so D has direct knowledge
3. D would likely trust their own observation over what an opponent tells them

Since D has firsthand knowledge of the basket contents and will likely answer correctly regardless of what I say, spending 0.5 points to try to deceive them would likely just cost us points without changing the outcome.

**Pass**
D answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. A (me), B, and D start in the room
2. B puts a banana in the basket
3. D leaves the room (D last saw: banana in basket)
4. B moves the banana from basket to bag
5. I put a stapler in the basket
6. B moves the stapler from basket to box
7. I move the banana from bag to basket

Current state: banana is in the basket, stapler is in the box, bag is empty.

D's knowledge: D left after seeing B put the banana in the basket. D doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So D believes the banana is still in the basket.

The question will be asked to D: "What is in the basket?"

D will likely answer "banana" based on their last observation - and that happens to be correct! The banana IS currently in the basket.

So if D answers based on what they last saw (banana in basket), they will be correct, and Red team gets 1 point.

Should I try to mislead D? I could Tell D false information about the basket contents. But D is on the Red team - they have no reason to trust me, and might ignore my information or even use it to confirm their own belief.

If I Tell(D, basket, stapler) - D might think I'm lying and stick with "banana" (which is correct).
If I Tell(D, basket, banana) - D would be more confident in their correct answer.

Actually, telling D the truth would help Red team. Telling D a lie might make them doubt, but they'd probably stick with what they saw.

The best strategy is to Pass - spending 0.5 points to potentially not change anything isn't worth it. D will likely answer correctly anyway based on their memory.

Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation strategically.

**What happened:**
1. I put a banana in the bag (everyone saw this)
2. C left the room
3. I moved the banana from the bag to the box (C didn't see this)
4. I put a stapler in the bag (C didn't see this)
5. B left the room

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put a banana in the bag
- C left before I moved the banana to the box and put the stapler in the bag
- So C believes the bag contains a banana

**What's actually in the bag:**
- A stapler

**The question:**
C will be asked what's in the bag. C thinks it's a banana, but it's actually a stapler.

**Strategic analysis:**
- C is on the Red team (my opponent)
- If C answers "banana" (which they likely will based on their knowledge), they'll be wrong
- The correct answer is "stapler"
- C getting it wrong means Red doesn't get a point

**Should I take an action?**
- If I Tell C the truth, I'd be helping my opponent score a point, which is bad for my team
- If I Pass, C will likely answer incorrectly based on outdated information
- There's no benefit to me using Ask or Tell here

The optimal play is to let C answer incorrectly.

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. I put a banana in the bag (everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room (C misses everything after this)

7. D moves banana from box to basket
8. I move banana from basket to box
9. D moves banana from box to basket

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: stapler
- Box: empty
- Basket: banana

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put a banana in the bag
- C left before any other actions
- C thinks the bag contains a banana

**The question is: What is in the bag?**
- Correct answer: stapler
- C's belief: banana

C is on the Red team and will likely answer "banana" (which is wrong). This is good for my team!

Since C is going to answer incorrectly based on their outdated information, I should **Pass**. There's no benefit to spending points to help an opponent, and C's wrong answer won't cost my team anything - it just means Red doesn't get a point.

Current state: The bag contains a stapler, the box contains a banana, the basket is empty.

C's perspective: C last saw me put a banana in the bag, then left. C doesn't know about any subsequent movements. So C believes the bag contains a banana.

The question will be asked to C about what's in the bag. C will likely answer "banana" based on their last knowledge, but the correct answer is "stapler."

C is on the Red team. If C answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point, which is good for my Blue team.

Should I help C? No - C is on the opposing team. I want C to answer incorrectly.

Should I tell C the truth? That would help the Red team score, which hurts my team.

Should I tell C false information? That costs 0.5 points and C might not believe me anyway since I'm on the opposing team.

The best action is to Pass. C will likely answer "banana" (incorrect), Red gets 0 points, and I don't spend any points.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put an apple in the basket, then left the room
- After D left, C moved the apple from the basket to the bag
- C then put an orange in the basket
- So currently: basket contains orange, bag contains apple

**What D knows:**
- D saw themselves put an apple in the basket
- D left before C moved anything
- D doesn't know C moved the apple to the bag and put an orange in the basket
- D believes the basket still contains the apple

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket.

**D's likely answer:** D will probably say "apple" (based on their last knowledge), but the correct answer is "orange."

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly (saying "apple" when it's actually "orange"), this is good for my Blue team. I don't need to help D, and I shouldn't waste points on an action that doesn't benefit my team.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put an apple in the basket, then left the room
- After D left: C moved the apple to the bag, C put an orange in the basket
- Then more movements happened, but D wasn't present for any of this
- Currently: the apple is in the box, the orange is in the basket

- D last saw the apple in the basket
- D doesn't know about any changes after leaving
- D will likely answer "apple" when asked about the basket

**What's actually in the basket:**
- An orange

**Strategic analysis:**
- D will be asked about the basket
- D likely thinks the apple is still there (since D left before any changes)
- The correct answer is "orange"
- D will probably answer "apple" and be wrong
- This is good for my team (Blue) - Red will not score this point

Since D is likely to answer incorrectly (saying "apple" instead of "orange"), this benefits my team. I don't need to spend points to help the opposing team, and I can't communicate with D anyway to mislead them (they're on the opposing team, so misleading them would actually help me, but D will already be wrong).

- After D left, C moved things around:
  - C moved the apple from basket to bag
  - C put an orange in the basket
  - C moved the apple from bag to box
  - C moved the apple from box to bag

**Current state:**
- Basket: orange

- D left before any of C's movements
- D thinks the basket contains an apple

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the basket.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask D what is in the basket."

So D (a Red team player) will be asked about the basket. D believes the apple is still in the basket (since D left before C moved anything). But the basket actually contains an orange now.

D will likely answer "apple" (what D believes is there), but the correct answer is "orange."

**Should I take an action?**
- D is on the Red team
- If D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point
- D doesn't know the truth, and I have no incentive to help D

If I Tell D the truth, I'd be helping the opposing team score a point, which would cost me 0.5 points AND give them 1 point - a net 1.5 point swing against my team.

If I Pass, D will likely answer "apple" (incorrect), Red gets 0 points, and I spend nothing.

- So currently: bag contains a ball, box contains a banana

**What D knows:**
- D saw me put a banana in the bag
- D left before I moved the banana to the box
- D left before B put a ball in the bag
- So D believes the bag still contains a banana

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag.

D is on the Red team (my opponent). D will likely answer "banana" based on what they saw before leaving. But the correct answer is "ball."

**Strategic analysis:**
- If D answers "banana" (what they believe), they'll be wrong - Red gets 0 points
- If I Tell D the truth (that the bag has a ball), D would answer correctly and Red gets 1 point, but it costs me 0.5 points
- If I do nothing (Pass), D will likely answer incorrectly

Since D is my opponent, I want them to answer incorrectly. D's outdated information will lead them to give the wrong answer. I should not help them.

**My action:** Pass

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a banana in the bag. ... C leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the banana from the bag to the box. ... B puts a ball in the bag. ... You move the banana from the box to the basket. ... B moves the banana from the basket to the box. ...

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a banana in the bag initially
- C and D left the room before any movements happened
- After they left: I moved the banana from bag → box → basket, B put a ball in the bag, B moved banana from basket → box, I moved banana from box → basket
- Final state: banana is in the basket, ball is in the bag

**What D believes:**
- D saw me put a banana in the bag, then left
- D doesn't know about any movements after leaving
- D thinks the banana is still in the bag

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

**D's likely answer:** D will probably say "banana" (based on what D last saw)

**Actual contents of the bag:** ball

**Analysis:**
- D answering "banana" would be WRONG (the bag actually contains a ball)
- This means the Red team will NOT get a point
- This is good for my team (Blue)

Since D is likely to answer incorrectly based on their outdated information, I don't need to spend points to help them or interfere. The situation already favors my team.

**My action:** Pass

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. All players (A, B, C, D) start in the room
2. I put a banana in the bag
3. C leaves the room
4. D leaves the room
5. I move the banana from the bag to the box
6. B puts a ball in the bag
7. B moves the banana from the box to the basket
8. I move the banana from the basket to the box

Current state:
- Bag: ball
- Box: banana
- Basket: empty

What does D know?
D left after step 2, so D only saw me put a banana in the bag. D doesn't know about any subsequent movements. D would believe the bag contains a banana.

The question is: What is in the bag?
- Actual answer: ball
- D's belief: banana

D is on the Red team. If D answers "banana" (what D believes), D will be wrong, and Red team gets 0 points.

Since D is on the opposing team and is likely to answer incorrectly (saying "banana" when the actual answer is "ball"), this is good for my team. I should not help D by telling them the correct answer.

I should Pass - there's no benefit to spending points on an action here. D will likely answer wrong, which doesn't hurt us, and we don't gain anything by communicating.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. All players (A, B, C, D) start in the room
2. I put a brick in the box (everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room
4. D leaves the room
5. I move the brick from box to basket (only A and B see this)
6. B moves the brick from basket to box (only A and B see this)
7. I move the brick from box to bag (only A and B see this)
8. B puts a ball in the box (only A and B see this)

So from D's perspective:
- D saw me put a brick in the box
- D left the room
- D doesn't know about any subsequent movements
- D would believe the brick is still in the box

The actual contents of the box: **a ball**

D will be asked what's in the box. D will likely answer "brick" based on what they last saw, which is incorrect. This means Red team won't get the point.

Since D answering incorrectly benefits my team (Blue), I should Pass. There's no need to spend points on an action when the outcome already favors us.

**Pass**
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put an apple in the box initially
- B left the room
- D moved the apple from the box to the bag
- D put a ball in the box
- Then I left the room

So when I left, the box contained a **ball** and the bag contained an **apple**.

**What C knows:**
C was in the room the entire time (never mentioned leaving), so C saw everything I saw. C knows the box contains a ball.

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the box.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask C what is in the box."

So C will be answering about the box contents. C was present for all events, so C knows the box contains a ball. C should answer correctly.

**Should I take an action?**
- C is on the Red team (my opponent)
- C knows the correct answer (ball)
- If C answers correctly, Red team gets 1 point

I could try to deceive C with a Tell action, but C was in the room the whole time and saw everything directly. C has no reason to believe any false information I might tell them over what they witnessed firsthand.

Any Tell action I make would cost my team 0.5 points and is unlikely to change C's answer since C has direct knowledge.

An Ask action would also cost 0.5 points and wouldn't help me here.

The best action is to Pass - it costs nothing, and I cannot realistically influence C's correct knowledge.

**Pass**
C answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room and saw everything until I left
- When I left, the state was:
  - Box: ball
  - Bag: apple
  - Basket: empty

**What C knows:**
- C was in the room the entire time and saw everything
- C knows the box contains a ball

**What B knows:**
- B left early and only saw: D put an apple in the box
- B thinks the box contains an apple (outdated information)

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the box.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask C what is in the box."

So C will be answering about the box contents. C was in the room the whole time, so C knows the box contains a ball. C should answer correctly.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I need to consider if there's any action I can take to help my team.

I could:
1. Tell C wrong information - but C was in the room and knows the truth, so C won't believe me
2. Ask someone something - but this costs 0.5 points and doesn't help since C already knows the answer
3. Pass - costs nothing

Since C witnessed everything and knows the box contains a ball, any Tell action to C would be pointless (C knows the truth). Any Ask action would just cost my team points without benefit.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

C answers: ball

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. D puts a stapler in the bag
2. C leaves the room
3. D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket (C doesn't see this)
4. C enters the room
5. D puts an apple in the bag (C sees this)
6. B leaves the room
7. D moves the stapler from the bag to the box (wait, the stapler was in the basket, not the bag - let me re-read)

Let me re-trace:
1. D puts stapler in bag → bag: stapler
2. C leaves
3. D moves stapler from bag to basket → bag: empty, basket: stapler
4. C enters
5. D puts apple in bag → bag: apple
6. B leaves
7. D moves stapler from bag to box → This seems wrong since stapler was in basket...

Wait, I need to re-read step 7: "D moves the stapler from the bag to the box" - but the stapler was in the basket at this point. Let me assume this is "D moves the stapler from the basket to the box" or there's an error. Actually, re-reading: it says "D moves the stapler from the bag to the box" - perhaps I misread earlier. Let me check again...

Actually the scenario says "D moves the stapler from the bag to the box" after B leaves. But the stapler was already moved to the basket. This might be a typo, but I'll work with what C knows.

From C's perspective (C was out when stapler moved to basket):
- C saw D put stapler in bag initially
- C left, then returned
- C saw D put apple in bag
- C saw D move stapler from bag to box (if C was present)
- C saw D put ball in bag

So C likely thinks the bag contains a ball.

The actual contents: After "D puts a ball in the bag" - the bag contains a ball.

C should know the correct answer (ball), so I don't need to help C. But wait, C is on the Red team - I don't want to help them!

I should Pass since helping C would help the opposing team.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Blue=0.0, Red=0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a brick in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... You move the brick from the basket to the box. ... C enters the room. ... D puts a banana in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. B puts a brick in the basket (everyone in room: A, B, C, D)
2. C leaves the room
3. I move the brick from the basket to the box (C is outside, doesn't see this)
4. C enters the room
5. D puts a banana in the basket (C is in the room, sees this)
6. I leave the room

Now, what does C know?
- C saw B put a brick in the basket initially
- C was outside when I moved the brick to the box
- C saw D put a banana in the basket
- C knows the basket currently contains: a banana

C will be asked what's in the basket. C actually knows the correct answer (banana) because C was present when D put the banana in the basket.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's anything I can do to help my team.

If I use Tell to give C false information, C might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team. Also, C directly witnessed D putting the banana in the basket, so C has firsthand knowledge and won't be fooled.

Using an action would cost my team 0.5 points with no benefit, since C has direct knowledge of the basket's contents.

Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to analyze this situation.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room the entire time
- D put a ball in the box
- D then left the room
- The box contains a ball

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the box.

Since I directly witnessed D putting the ball in the box, I know with certainty that the box contains a ball. I don't need to ask anyone for information, and there's no strategic benefit to telling anyone anything right now.

The optimal action is to Pass, since:
1. I already know the answer (ball is in the box)
2. Asking would cost 0.5 points unnecessarily
3. Telling wouldn't help me answer the question

- B moved the banana from basket to bag
- I moved the banana from bag to basket

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an apple in the box. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... D puts a brick in the box. ... D leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask you what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. I, B, and D start in the room together
2. D puts an apple in the box (I see this)
3. I leave the room (I can no longer see what happens inside)
4. I enter the room (I can now see what happens again)
5. D puts a brick in the box (I see this)
6. D leaves the room

Now, what's currently in the box? When D "puts a brick in the box" - since each container can only hold one object, this means the brick replaced whatever was there. So the box now contains a brick.

But wait - I need to consider what happened while I was outside the room. Between when I left and when I returned, something could have happened that I didn't see. However, B was in the room the entire time and would have seen everything.

When I returned and saw "D puts a brick in the box," this tells me the current state: the box contains a brick.

Since I'm going to be asked what's in the box, and I witnessed D putting a brick in the box after I returned, I know the answer is "brick."

I don't need to Ask anyone because I directly observed the final action - D putting a brick in the box. This is the current state.

Correct! The box contains brick.

**What I know:**
- D put a ball in the basket, then left the room
- After D left, I moved the ball from the basket to the bag
- C then put a brick in the basket
- So the basket currently contains a brick

**What others know:**
- B saw everything I saw (was in the room the whole time), so B knows the basket has a brick
- C saw me move the ball and put the brick in the basket, so C knows the basket has a brick

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the basket.

I know the answer is **a brick**. I don't need to ask anyone for information since I directly observed everything that happened to the basket.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Initially: empty bag, empty box, empty basket
2. D puts a brick in the box (I saw this - box now has brick)
3. I leave the room (I can't see what happens inside)
4. I enter the room (I can now see what happens)
5. C moves the brick from the bag to the box (I saw this)

Wait - step 5 says C moves the brick FROM the bag TO the box. But when I left, the brick was in the box, not the bag. This means while I was outside, someone must have moved the brick from the box to the bag. Then when I returned, C moved it back from the bag to the box.

So currently, the brick is in the box.

Since I will be asked what is in the box, and I know the answer is "brick" based on what I observed (C moved the brick from the bag to the box while I was present), I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... C puts a banana in the box. ... B enters the room. ... D enters the room. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room initially
2. B leaves the room
3. D leaves the room
4. C puts a banana in the box (only I and C see this)
5. B enters the room
6. D enters the room
7. I leave the room

So at the end:
- I know the box contains a banana (I saw C put it there)
- B does NOT know what's in the box (B was outside when C put the banana in)
- C knows the box contains a banana (C put it there)
- D does NOT know what's in the box (D was outside when C put the banana in)

I'm going to be asked what is in the box. I know the answer - it's a banana. I don't need to ask anyone or tell anyone anything to answer this question correctly.

Since I already know the answer and I'm the one being asked, there's no benefit to spending 0.5 points on an Ask or Tell action.

Pass
A answers: banana
Incorrect. The box actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

So what do I know about the box? I saw C put a banana in the box.

The question will be asked to me: "What is in the box?"

I know the answer is **banana** because I was in the room when C put it there.

Since I already know what's in the box, I don't need to Ask anyone. I could Tell my teammate B, but that would cost 0.5 points and isn't necessary since I'm the one being asked.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. B leaves the room
3. D leaves the room
4. C puts an apple in the bag (only A and C see this)

9. C moves the apple from the bag to the basket (A, B, C, D all see this)
10. D moves the apple from the basket to the bag (A, B, C, D all see this)
11. D leaves the room
12. D enters the room
13. I (A) leave the room

So the final state is: the apple is in the bag.

When I left the room at the end, I was aware that the apple was in the bag (from step 10). Since I left the room, I need to consider if anything could have happened after I left. But the scenario ends with "You leave the room..." and nothing else is described happening after that.

Since I know the apple is in the bag from what I observed before leaving, and I'm going to be asked what's in the bag, I should know the answer is "apple."

However, I'm currently outside the room. The question will be asked to me, and I know the answer based on what I saw before leaving. There's no indication anything changed after I left.

I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions since I already know the answer.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about this situation.

Let me recall what I observed:
- I was in the room when B put a ball in the bag
- Then I left the room
- Then B left the room

Since I was in the room when B put the ball in the bag, I directly witnessed this action. I know the bag contains a ball.

After I left, B was still in the room briefly before also leaving. However, since I know what was in the bag when I left, and I'll be asked about the bag's contents, I need to consider if anything could have changed after I left.

When I left, only B remained in the room (C and D's status isn't clear from the scenario - it says we were all in the room initially, but doesn't mention them leaving before me). Actually, re-reading: "You, B, C, and D are in a room" - so all four were there initially. Then "You leave the room" and "B leaves the room" - but C and D's movements aren't mentioned, so they might still be in the room.

If C and D stayed in the room after I left, they could have moved the ball. But I don't have information about what happened after I left.

However, I directly saw B put a ball in the bag, and I'm being asked what's in the bag. Based on my direct observation, the answer is "ball."

Since I already know the answer from my own observation, I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me recall what I observed:
1. I was in the room with B, C, and D
2. B put a ball in the bag
3. B put a stapler in the basket
4. I left the room
5. B left the room

After I left the room, I don't know what happened inside. However, I do know that B also left the room after me. C and D remained in the room after both B and I left, so they could have moved objects around.

But wait - I need to answer what is in the bag. Based on what I directly observed before leaving:
- B put a ball in the bag

The question is: did anything change after I left? C and D were still in the room and could have manipulated the containers. However, I have no information about what they did.

Since I directly witnessed B putting a ball in the bag, and I'm being asked what's in the bag, I should consider whether I need more information.

The key insight is: I saw the ball go into the bag. After I left, C and D (opponents) were still in the room and could have moved things. But I have no way of knowing if they did.

Should I ask someone? 
- Asking B wouldn't help since B also left after me
- Asking C or D (opponents) is risky since they might lie

Given that:
1. I have direct knowledge of the ball being in the bag
2. Asking opponents risks getting false information
3. B doesn't have more information than me about what happened after we both left

I'll trust my direct observation and save the 0.5 points.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to think about what I know and what action to take.

Let me recall what I observed:
1. I was in the room with B, C, and D
2. B put a ball in the bag
3. B put a brick in the basket
4. I left the room
5. B left the room

After I left the room, I don't know what happened inside. B also left after me, so B would know what happened until they left. C and D might still be in the room (it wasn't stated that they left).

However, the question is asking ME what is in the bag. I saw B put a ball in the bag before I left. After I left, something could have changed, but I need to consider:
- C and D (opponents) were still in the room and could have moved things
- I won't know what they did after I left

Since I'm being asked the question directly, I need to decide if I should:
1. Pass - costs nothing, and I'll answer based on my knowledge (ball in bag)
2. Ask B - B left after me, so B might know if anything changed before they left

Actually, B left after me, so B would have more recent information about the bag's contents. If C or D moved the ball before B left, B would know. But asking costs 0.5 points.

Given that I saw the ball placed in the bag and I'm reasonably confident (unless C or D moved it after I left but before B left, B would know), let me consider the risk. The opponents C and D could have manipulated things after both B and I left.

Since I'm the one being asked and I directly witnessed the ball being placed in the bag, I'll Pass and answer with my knowledge. The cost-benefit of asking doesn't seem worth it here.

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about what I know and what I should do.

Let me trace through what I observed:
1. I was in the room when B put a stapler in the bag.
2. I left the room (missed what happened while I was out).
3. I entered the room again.
4. I saw D move the stapler from the bag to the basket.
5. I saw C move the stapler from the basket to the bag.
6. I left the room.
7. B left the room.

So when I left the room the second time, the stapler was in the bag (C had just moved it there).

After I left, B also left. Neither of us knows what happened after we both left - but wait, looking at the scenario, it seems like the scenario ends with "B leaves the room" and then the question is asked.

At the point when I left, the stapler was in the bag. After I left, B left too. C and D were still in the room (or at least, I wasn't told they left). So C and D could have moved things around after both B and I left.

Since I'm being asked what's in the bag, and I last saw the stapler in the bag, but C and D (opponents) were still in the room after I left, they could have moved it.

However, I should consider: the question is being asked to ME. I need to answer based on what I know. The last thing I saw was the stapler in the bag. But C and D might have moved it after I left.

Since this is the action phase and I can take an action before answering, I could Ask C or D what's in the bag. But they're opponents and might lie to me.

Actually, since I'm about to be asked and I last saw the stapler in the bag, and there's no indication anything changed after I left (the scenario just says B leaves), I should trust my last observation.

No actions involving containers were described after I left (from my perspective, I would only see people entering/leaving).

So as far as I know, the apple is still in the box.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D leaves the room. ... C puts a brick in the box. ... D enters the room. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... D moves the brick from the box to the basket. ... C moves the brick from the basket to the box. ... You leave the room. ... C leaves the room. ...

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box based on what I observed.

Let me trace through what I saw:
1. I was in the room with B, C, and D initially
2. D left the room
3. C put a brick in the box (I saw this)
4. D entered the room
5. I left the room (so I can't see what happens next while I'm out)
6. I entered the room
7. D moved the brick from the box to the basket (I saw this)
8. C moved the brick from the basket to the box (I saw this)
9. I left the room (so I can't see what happens after this)
10. C left the room

When I left the room the second time, the brick was in the box (C had just moved it there). After I left, only B and D remained in the room. I don't know if anything happened after I left.

Since I'm going to be asked about the box, I should consider whether B (my teammate who stayed in the room) might have seen something happen after I left. However, the scenario only mentions "C leaves the room" after I left - no other actions are described.

But wait - the scenario describes what I see, so if something happened while I was outside, it wouldn't be shown to me. Let me check if B could help me.

Actually, since I'm the one being asked and I need to answer, I should determine if I need information from B. When I last saw the room, the brick was in the box. B stayed in the room after I left, so B would know if anything changed.

Let me Ask B about the box to confirm:

Ask(B, box)
A answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

I was in the room when D put a stapler in the bag. Then I left the room. The scenario doesn't mention anything else happening after I left (just "..."), so I have no reason to believe the contents of the bag changed.

I know the bag contains a stapler because I witnessed D putting it there before I left.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to think about this situation.

Let me recall what I observed:
- D put a stapler in the bag
- I put a ball in the basket
- Then I left the room

Since I was in the room when D put the stapler in the bag, I know the bag contains a stapler. However, after I left the room, I don't know if anything changed - someone could have moved the stapler or replaced it with something else.

But wait - the scenario only describes what I observed. Since I left the room, if anything happened after that, it wouldn't be described to me (except for players entering/leaving). The scenario doesn't mention anyone else leaving or entering after I left, so C and D remained in the room.

The question is: do I know what's in the bag right now? When I left, the stapler was in the bag. But C and D could have moved things around after I left, and I wouldn't know about it.

However, since I'm being asked what's in the bag, and I last saw a stapler there, I should consider whether I need more information. 

My teammate B was in the room when I left, so B would know if anything changed after I left. I could ask B about the bag's contents to confirm whether the stapler is still there.

The cost of asking is 0.5 points, and a correct answer gives 1 point. If I'm uncertain, asking B would be worthwhile if there's a reasonable chance something changed.

Given that C and D (opponents) remained in the room and could have manipulated things to make me answer incorrectly, it's prudent to verify with B.

Ask(B, bag)
A answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Let me recall what I observed:
- I was in the room when D put a stapler in the bag
- I was in the room when D put a brick in the basket
- Then I left the room

Since I was present when D put the stapler in the bag, I know the bag contains a stapler. After I left, something might have happened, but based on what I directly observed, the bag had a stapler in it.

However, I left the room, so I don't know if anything changed after I left. But the question is asking me what's in the bag, and I have direct knowledge from when I was in the room.

Since I already know the answer (stapler) from my own observation, there's no need to spend points on an Ask or Tell action.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. I was in the room when D put a banana in the box.
2. I left the room.
3. I entered the room again.
4. While I was in the room, D moved the banana from the box to the basket.
5. While I was in the room, C moved the banana from the basket to the box.
6. I left the room.

So when I left the room the final time, the banana was in the box. Since I left the room after that, I need to consider if anything could have happened after I left.

The scenario ends with "You leave the room..." and then the question is asked. There's no indication that anything happened after I left.

Based on what I observed:
- The banana is in the box (this was the last state I witnessed before leaving)

Since I directly observed C moving the banana to the box, and nothing is described as happening after I left, I know the answer: the banana is in the box.

I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions since I have direct knowledge of the box's contents.

Pass

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a stapler in the box
- D left the room, then B left the room
- I'm still in the room with C

**What B knows:**
- B put the stapler in the box and then left
- B doesn't know if anything changed after they left

**What could have happened after B left:**
- C and I are still in the room
- C (Red team) could potentially move the stapler to trick B

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the box.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the box."

So B will be asked about the box contents. B knows they put a stapler in the box. B left the room after that, so B doesn't know if anything changed.

**Current situation:**
- The stapler is still in the box (nothing has moved since B left based on what I observed)
- B should correctly answer "stapler" 

**Should I take an action?**
- B already knows the correct answer (stapler) from their own action
- Telling B would cost 0.5 points and B already knows
- There's no benefit to spending points here

**Decision:** Pass

Since B personally put the stapler in the box and nothing has changed since then (I've been watching), B should correctly answer "stapler" and earn our team 1 point. There's no need to spend 0.5 points on a Tell action.

**Pass**
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

**What I know:**
- B put a stapler in the box (B saw this)
- D left the room
- B left the room
- After B left: C put an apple in the bag, I moved the apple to the basket, C moved the apple back to the bag

**What B knows:**
- B put a stapler in the box
- B is unaware of anything that happened after leaving (the apple movements)
- The box still contains the stapler (nothing changed with the box)

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the box.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the box."

So B will be asked about the box. B put the stapler in the box and left. Nothing happened to the box after B left - the only movements involved the apple between the bag and basket.

**Current state of the box:** Still contains the stapler (unchanged)

**What B believes is in the box:** The stapler (B put it there and has no information suggesting it moved)

B should answer correctly! B knows the stapler is in the box because B put it there, and B has no reason to think it moved.

Since B will likely answer correctly on their own (earning us 1 point), there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something they already know.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a stapler in the box (B saw this)
- B left the room before any other movements happened
- The stapler is still in the box (nothing was moved from the box)

**What B knows:**
- B put a stapler in the box
- B left the room, so B doesn't know about any subsequent movements
- But the box contents never changed - the stapler is still there

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the box.

Since B put the stapler in the box and then left, B knows the stapler is in the box. The stapler was never moved, so B's knowledge is correct.

B should correctly answer "stapler" when asked about the box contents.

**Should I take an action?**
- B already knows the correct answer (stapler in the box)
- Telling B would cost 0.5 points and provide no benefit
- B's knowledge is accurate

The optimal action is to Pass, since B already has the correct information and any action would cost points unnecessarily.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a brick in the box, then left the room
- After B left, C moved things around:
  - Moved brick from box to bag
  - Put stapler in box
  - Moved stapler from box to basket
  - Moved brick from bag to box

**Current state:** The brick is in the box (back where it started, but B doesn't know about all the movements)

**What B believes:** B last saw the brick in the box, then left. B doesn't know about C's movements. So B thinks the brick is still in the box.

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the box.

**Analysis:** B believes the brick is in the box, and the brick IS actually in the box. So B will likely answer "brick" which is correct! Our team will get 1 point without me needing to spend 0.5 points on a Tell action.

If I Tell B the contents, I'd spend 0.5 points unnecessarily since B already has the correct belief.

8. I (A) move the orange from box to bag (A, C see this; B, D don't)
9. C moves the orange from bag to box (A, C see this; B, D don't)

Current state:
- Basket: banana
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty

What does B know?
- B last saw: orange moved to bag, then B put banana in basket
- B thinks: basket has banana, bag has orange, box is empty

B will be asked what's in the basket. B believes the basket has a banana, which is correct!

Since B already knows the correct answer (banana is in the basket), I don't need to spend points telling B anything. B's knowledge is accurate for this question.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a brick in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the brick from the basket to the bag. ... B puts a banana in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the brick from the bag to the box. ... C moves the banana from the basket to the bag. ... C moves the banana from the bag to the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. B puts a brick in the basket (B sees this)
2. D leaves the room
3. C moves the brick from basket to bag (B sees this)
4. B puts a banana in the basket (B sees this)
5. B leaves the room
6. C moves the brick from bag to box (B doesn't see this)
7. C moves the banana from basket to bag (B doesn't see this)
8. C moves the banana from bag to basket (B doesn't see this)

So from B's perspective (what B last knew before leaving):
- Brick was in the bag
- Banana was in the basket

The actual current state:
- Brick is in the box
- Banana is in the basket

B will be asked what's in the basket. B last saw the banana being put in the basket, and didn't see it being moved (it was moved to bag then back to basket). So B should correctly believe the banana is in the basket.

Wait, let me re-check: B put the banana in the basket, then left. After B left, C moved the banana to the bag, then back to the basket. So the banana IS currently in the basket.

B's belief: banana is in the basket
Reality: banana is in the basket

B should answer correctly! B will likely say "banana" and that's correct.

Since B should answer correctly on their own, I don't need to spend 0.5 points to tell B anything. The best action is to Pass.

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a stapler in the basket while B was in the room
- B then left the room
- Nothing else happened to the basket after B left

**What B knows:**
- B put the stapler in the basket
- B left the room, but nothing happened to the basket after B left (from B's perspective, B would know if anyone entered/left, but no one did)

So B should know that the stapler is still in the basket. B was present when they put it there, and B would be aware that no one entered the room after they left (since players know when others enter/leave even when outside).

**What C knows:**
- C saw B put the stapler in the basket
- C is still in the room

Since B should correctly remember putting the stapler in the basket, and B knows no one entered the room after they left to potentially move it, B should answer correctly.

There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something they already know. The optimal action is to Pass.

**Pass**
B answers: stapler

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a banana in the basket, then left the room
- After B left, C made several moves:
  - Moved banana from basket to bag
  - Put orange in basket
  - Moved orange from basket to box
  - Moved banana from bag to basket

**Current state of containers:**
- Basket: banana
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty

**What B believes:**
B only saw themselves put a banana in the basket, then left. B is unaware of all the moves C made afterward. So B thinks the basket still contains the banana.

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the basket.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask B what is in the basket."

So B will be asked directly. B thinks the banana is in the basket (which happens to be correct now, since C moved it back). B will answer "banana" which is actually correct!

**Should I take an action?**
- B will likely answer "banana" (what B last knew was there)
- The basket actually contains a banana (after C's moves)
- B's answer will be correct!

Since B's belief aligns with reality (the banana is indeed in the basket), B will answer correctly and our team will get 1 point. There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B anything.

**My action:** Pass

So B will be asked what is in the bag. B thinks the apple is in the bag (because B left before the changes). But actually, the ball is in the bag now.

If B answers "apple" (what B believes), B will be wrong and Red gets nothing, Blue gets nothing.
If B answers "ball" (the truth), B will be correct and Blue gets 1 point.

I should tell B what is actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and earn our team a point.

**What B knows:** B last saw the apple in the bag, then left. B doesn't know about any changes after leaving.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put an apple in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the apple from the box to the bag. ... C puts a ball in the box. ... C moves the apple from the bag to the basket. ... You move the apple from the basket to the bag. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put an apple in the box initially
- B left the room before C made any changes
- After B left: C moved the apple to the bag, put a ball in the box, moved the apple to the basket, then I moved the apple to the bag
- Current state: ball is in the box, apple is in the bag

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put an apple in the box
- B left before any changes were made
- B thinks the apple is still in the box

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the box.
- B will likely answer "apple" (which is wrong - the box contains a ball)
- If B answers incorrectly, Blue team gets 0 points

**My options:**
1. **Tell(B, box, ball)** - This costs 0.5 points but would allow B to answer correctly and earn 1 point. Net gain: +0.5 points
2. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but B will likely answer "apple" incorrectly. Net gain: 0 points

Since telling B the correct contents (ball) would result in a net gain of 0.5 points for our team (1 point for correct answer minus 0.5 cost), this is the optimal play.

Tell(B, box, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a banana in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ...

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a banana in the bag initially
- B left the room before seeing any movements
- C moved the banana from bag → basket (B didn't see this)
- D moved the banana from basket → bag (B didn't see this)
- D left the room
- C moved the banana from bag → box (B didn't see this)
- C put a ball in the bag (B didn't see this)

**What B believes:**
B left the room right after I put the banana in the bag. B didn't witness any of the subsequent movements. So B believes the banana is still in the bag.

**Current reality:**
- The bag contains a ball
- The box contains the banana
- The basket is empty

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the bag.

B will likely answer "banana" (based on their last knowledge), but the correct answer is "ball."

If B answers "banana" → incorrect → Blue team gets 0 points
If B answers "ball" → correct → Blue team gets 1 point

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so they can answer correctly.

Tell(B, bag, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- C put a banana in the bag
- B left the room
- After B left: D moved the banana from the bag to the box
- After B left: C put an orange in the bag

**What B knows:**
- B saw C put a banana in the bag
- B does NOT know that D moved the banana to the box (B was outside)
- B does NOT know that C put an orange in the bag (B was outside)
- So B thinks the bag contains: banana

**What's actually in the bag:**
- Orange (the banana was moved to the box)

**The question will be asked to B:** "What is in the bag?"

B will likely answer "banana" based on their knowledge, but the correct answer is "orange."

**My decision:**
Since B is my teammate and will answer incorrectly without help, I should tell B what's actually in the bag. This costs 0.5 points but could gain us 1 point if B answers correctly.

Expected value of telling: 1 - 0.5 = +0.5 points
Expected value of passing: 0 points (B will answer wrong)

Tell(B, bag, orange)
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I saw everything that happened in the room
- The bag currently contains: an orange
- The box currently contains: empty
- The basket currently contains: a banana

**What B knows:**
- B saw C put a banana in the bag initially
- B then left the room and missed everything after that
- B thinks the bag contains: a banana (but it actually contains an orange now)

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the bag, but actually B will be asked directly what is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the bag."

B will answer based on what B believes. B left after seeing C put a banana in the bag, so B believes the bag contains a banana. But the bag actually contains an orange.

B is my teammate. If B answers "banana," B will be wrong (the bag has an orange), and we won't get the point.

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly.

**My action:**
Tell(B, bag, orange)

This costs 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we gain 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points.
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- C put a banana in the bag
- B left the room
- After B left: D moved the banana from bag to box
- After B left: C put an orange in the bag
- After B left: C moved the banana from box to basket
- After B left: D moved the banana from basket to box

**Current state of containers:**
- Bag: orange
- Box: banana
- Basket: empty

**What B knows:**
B left after seeing C put a banana in the bag. B doesn't know about any movements that happened after they left. So B thinks:
- Bag: banana (B's outdated belief)

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the bag, but actually B will be asked directly.

Since B will be asked what's in the bag, and B believes the banana is still there (because B left before the orange was placed and the banana was moved), B will likely answer "banana" - which is incorrect. The correct answer is "orange."

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B left the room before several movements happened
- B saw: C put a brick in the box, then B left
- After B left: D moved brick from box to basket, C moved brick from basket to box, D moved brick from box to bag, C put an orange in the box
- Current state: The box contains an orange, the bag contains the brick, the basket is empty

**What B believes:**
- B last saw C put a brick in the box, then left
- B doesn't know about any movements after leaving
- B likely thinks the box still contains the brick

**The question:** I will be asked what's in the box, but wait - the question says "I am going to ask B what is in the box."

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room the entire time
- C put a ball in the basket
- C then left the room
- B was also in the room the entire time, so B also saw C put the ball in the basket

**The question:** I (the game) will ask B what is in the basket.

**Analysis:**
Since B was in the room when C put the ball in the basket, B knows the answer. B saw everything I saw. There's no need for me to tell B anything - B already has complete information about the basket's contents.

The optimal action is to **Pass** because:
1. B already knows the ball is in the basket (B witnessed it)
2. Spending 0.5 points to tell B something B already knows would be wasteful
3. B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room
2. C puts a ball in the basket (everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room
4. B puts an apple in the box (A, B, D see this - C is outside)
5. D moves the apple from box to bag (A, B, D see this)
6. B moves the apple from bag to box (A, B, D see this)

Current state:
- Basket: ball
- Box: apple
- Bag: empty

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the basket?"

B was in the room when C put the ball in the basket, so B knows the basket contains a ball. B should be able to answer this correctly.

Since B has direct knowledge of what's in the basket (B witnessed C putting the ball there), B doesn't need any help from me. B can answer "ball" correctly.

Taking an action would cost 0.5 points and isn't necessary here.

B answers: ball

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. C puts a brick in the basket - everyone sees this
3. B leaves the room
4. D moves the brick from basket to bag - B doesn't see this (B is outside)
5. B enters the room
6. C moves the brick from bag to basket - B sees this
7. C leaves the room

So what does B know?
- B saw C put the brick in the basket initially
- B was outside when D moved the brick to the bag
- B saw C move the brick from the bag to the basket

Wait - B actually DID see C move the brick from the bag to the basket when B re-entered. So B knows the brick is currently in the basket.

Let me verify: B entered the room, THEN C moved the brick from bag to basket. So B was present for that action and knows the brick is in the basket.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the basket?"
The correct answer is: the brick (since C moved it back to the basket, and B witnessed this)

B should know the correct answer (brick in basket) because B was in the room when C made that final move.

Since B already knows the correct answer, I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

6. B moves the ball from the bag to the basket
7. I move the ball from the basket to the bag
8. B moves the ball from the bag to the basket

So currently:
- The box contains an apple
- The basket contains the ball
- The bag is empty

B is my teammate and was in the room the entire time. B directly participated in moving objects and was present when I put the apple in the box. B should know that the box contains an apple.

Since B was in the room for all these events, B should be fully aware that:
- The ball ended up in the basket (B made the last move)
- I put an apple in the box

B should be able to correctly answer "apple" for what's in the box.

There's no need for me to Tell B anything since B witnessed everything. Using an action would cost 0.5 points unnecessarily.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

4. B moves the ball from the box to the bag
5. I put an apple in the box
6. I move the ball from the bag to the basket
7. B moves the ball from the basket to the bag
8. I move the ball from the bag to the basket
9. B moves the ball from the basket to the bag

Current state:
- Box contains: apple
- Bag contains: ball
- Basket contains: empty

B is my teammate and was in the room the entire time with me. B directly participated in moving objects and saw me put the apple in the box. B knows exactly what's in the box (the apple).

Since B was present for all actions and specifically saw me put the apple in the box, B should know the correct answer. There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something they already know.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. D puts a stapler in the bag (everyone sees this)
2. B leaves the room
3. C moves the stapler from bag to basket (B doesn't see this)
4. B enters the room
5. D puts a ball in the bag (B sees this)
6. D leaves the room
7. C leaves the room
8. B moves the stapler from the bag to the box (Wait - B thinks the stapler is in the bag, but it's actually in the basket. B would try to move it but wouldn't find it there)

Actually, let me reconsider. The scenario says "B moves the stapler from the bag to the box" - this is what actually happened in the game world. But wait, the stapler was in the basket at this point, not the bag. 

Hmm, I need to interpret this as what actually occurred. If the scenario states B moved the stapler from the bag to the box, then that's what happened (perhaps the game allows this action to occur as described).

So the current state:
- Bag: apple (I put it there)
- Box: stapler (B moved it there)
- Basket: empty

What does B believe is in the bag?
- B saw D put the stapler in the bag
- B left and missed C moving the stapler to the basket
- B returned and saw D put a ball in the bag
- B moved what they thought was the stapler from bag to box
- B saw me put an apple in the bag

B should know the bag contains an apple, since B was present when I put the apple in the bag.

The question is: What is in the bag? Answer: apple

B was present when I put the apple in the bag, so B should know this. B should answer correctly.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Let me trace what happened:
1. Me (A), B, and D are in the room
2. D puts a brick in the basket (B and I both see this)
3. B leaves the room
4. D moves the brick from the basket to the bag (only I see this, B is outside)
5. B enters the room
6. D moves the brick from the bag to the basket (B and I both see this)

Now, what does B know?
- B saw D put a brick in the basket initially
- B left and missed the move to the bag
- B returned and saw D move the brick from the bag to the basket

So B knows the brick is currently in the basket! B saw the final move from bag to basket, even though B didn't see how it got to the bag.

Since B will be asked what's in the basket, and B witnessed the brick being moved from the bag to the basket, B should know the answer is "brick."

I don't need to spend points telling B something they already know.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what each player knows:

1. **Me (A)**: I saw everything until I left. I put an apple in the basket. So I know the basket contains an apple.

2. **B**: B left before I put the apple in the basket, then re-entered after I put the apple in. When B re-entered, B would see the current state of the room, but B cannot see inside containers. So B doesn't know what's in the basket.

3. **C**: C left before I put the apple in the basket, then re-entered after. Same as B - C doesn't know what's in the basket.

4. **D**: D was in the room the entire time and saw me put the apple in the basket. D knows the basket contains an apple.

The question will be asked to B about what's in the basket. B doesn't know the answer because B was outside when I put the apple in the basket.

Since B is my teammate and doesn't know the answer, I should tell B what's in the basket so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but the benefit of a correct answer is 1 point, so the net gain would be 0.5 points.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the bag (I saw this)
- C put a ball in the basket (I saw this)
- I left the room, then B left the room
- After we both left, C and D remained in the room - they could have moved objects around, but I wouldn't know about it

**What B knows:**
- B put an apple in the bag
- B saw C put a ball in the basket
- B left after me, so B might have seen more than me
- After B left, C and D were alone and could have moved things

**The question will be asked to B: "What is in the bag?"**

From B's perspective, B put an apple in the bag. However, after B left, C and D could have changed things. B doesn't know what happened after leaving.

From my perspective, I left before B, so B actually has more information than me about what happened while I was gone but B was still there. But I don't know what B saw during that time.

Since B put the apple in the bag and was in the room after me, B likely knows the apple was in the bag when B left. The question is whether C or D moved it after B left.

I don't have any additional useful information to share with B that B doesn't already know. B knows B put the apple in the bag. Telling B what's in the bag would cost 0.5 points and B already has this information from direct experience.

The best action is to Pass - spending 0.5 points to tell B something B already knows would be wasteful.

**Pass**
B answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the bag. ... D puts a brick in the basket. ... You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room when B put an apple in the bag
- I was in the room when D put a brick in the basket
- I left the room, then B left the room
- After we both left, C and D remained in the room (so things could have changed)

**What B knows:**
- B put an apple in the bag
- B saw D put a brick in the basket
- B left the room after me, so B might have seen more than me before leaving
- B doesn't know what happened after leaving

**The question will be asked to B about the bag.**

B knows they put an apple in the bag. However, after B left, C and D were still in the room and could have moved things around. But B wouldn't know about any changes that happened after they left.

Since B was present when they put the apple in the bag, and B will answer based on their own knowledge, B should answer "apple" - which was correct when B last saw it.

The key question is: did anything change after B left? I don't have information about what happened after I left (except that B also left). So I can't know if C or D moved the apple.

B's knowledge is that the bag contains an apple (from when B put it there). B should answer correctly based on their last observation.

Since B already knows what they put in the bag, and I don't have any additional information that would help B (I left before B did), there's no benefit to spending 0.5 points on a Tell or Ask action.

**Pass**
B answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I saw B put a stapler in the bag before I left the room
- After I left: B left, C left, C entered, B entered, B left
- I don't know what happened while I was outside the room

**What B knows:**
- B put the stapler in the bag
- B left the room after me
- B re-entered the room (while C was inside)
- B then left again

**The key question:** Does B know what's currently in the bag?

When B re-entered the room, B would have been able to observe anything that happened while B was inside. However, B wouldn't know what C or D did while B was outside (between when B first left and when B re-entered).

During B's second visit to the room, B could observe the room state and any actions. But B wouldn't necessarily know if C moved the stapler while B was out.

**My assessment:**
- B originally put the stapler in the bag
- B might assume the stapler is still there, but C had time alone in the room (after B left the first time and before B re-entered) when C could have moved it
- B was in the room with C during B's second visit, so B would know if anything changed then

B likely believes the stapler is still in the bag (since B put it there and may not have seen it moved). The stapler is probably still there unless C moved it during the brief window when C was alone.

Since B put the stapler in the bag and was present for most of the time, B likely has accurate knowledge. I should Pass to save points - B should be able to answer correctly.

**Pass**
B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Current situation:
- I put a stapler in the bag
- C left the room BEFORE B left, so C didn't see what I put in the bag
- B was in the room when I put the stapler in the bag, so B knows the contents
- C will be asked what's in the bag

Since C left before I put the stapler in the bag, C doesn't know what's in it. C will likely guess wrong, which means the Red team won't get a point.

If I use Tell to inform C of the correct contents, I'd be helping the opposing team score a point (costing my team 0.5 points AND giving them 1 point).

If I Pass, C will have to guess without information, and will likely get it wrong since C wasn't in the room when I put the stapler in the bag.

The optimal action is to Pass - this costs nothing and C will probably answer incorrectly since they don't know what's in the bag.

**What I know:**
- I put a stapler in the bag
- D put a ball in the box
- I moved the ball from the box to the basket
- D moved the ball from the basket back to the box

**What C knows:**
C was in the room when I put the stapler in the bag, but C left before any ball movements happened. So C knows:
- The bag contains a stapler

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag.

C should know the correct answer (stapler) because C was present when I put the stapler in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. The stapler is still in the bag.

Since C is on the Red team (my opponent), and C likely knows the correct answer, I need to consider if there's any way to help my team or hurt the Red team.

However, I cannot communicate with C to mislead them (telling them wrong information would cost me 0.5 points and C has no reason to trust me as an opponent). C already has the correct information from direct observation.

The best action is to **Pass** - spending 0.5 points to tell or ask anyone won't change the outcome here. C witnessed me put the stapler in the bag and will likely answer correctly.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a stapler in the bag
- C left the room before any other actions happened
- The bag still contains the stapler (nothing changed with the bag after I put the stapler in)

**What C knows:**
- C was in the room when I put the stapler in the bag
- C left before any of the brick movements happened
- C should know the bag contains a stapler

Since C saw me put the stapler in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that, C should correctly know that the bag contains a stapler. C is on the Red team, so they will answer correctly and score a point for their team.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - C will likely answer "stapler" correctly, giving Red 1 point
2. **Tell(C, bag, [wrong item])** - This costs 0.5 points and C might not believe me since they saw me put the stapler in. C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team).
3. **Ask** - Doesn't help here

Since C directly witnessed me putting the stapler in the bag, telling C false information is unlikely to work - they have firsthand knowledge. Spending 0.5 points to attempt deception that will almost certainly fail is not worth it.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. I put a ball in the bag
3. C leaves the room (C last saw: ball in bag)
4. B moves ball from bag to box
5. D puts orange in bag
6. B moves orange from bag to basket
7. D moves ball from box to bag
8. B leaves the room

Current state: ball is in the bag, basket has orange, box is empty.

What does C know? C left after I put the ball in the bag. C's last knowledge is that the ball is in the bag. C doesn't know about any subsequent movements.

So when asked "what is in the bag?", C will likely answer "ball" based on their last knowledge - and that happens to be correct! The ball IS currently in the bag (D moved it back there).

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if I can mislead C. However, C is not in the room, and I can only Tell or Ask.

If I Tell C false information, C might believe me (but why would C trust an opponent?). C might be suspicious of information from an opposing team member.

Actually, C's natural answer based on their own observation would be "ball" - which is correct. If I try to tell C something different, C might:
1. Ignore me (opponent giving info is suspicious)
2. Believe me and answer wrong

The risk is that C will likely not trust me since I'm on the opposing team. Spending 0.5 points to potentially mislead C seems risky if C won't believe me anyway.

I'll Pass to avoid losing points on an action that likely won't work.

Pass
C answers: ball

**What I know:**

- D put a stapler in the basket
- C left the room

**What C knows:**
C was in the room when:
- D put an apple in the basket

Then C left. So C knows the basket contains a **stapler**.

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the basket.

Wait, let me re-read. "I am going to ask C what is in the basket."

So C will be answering. C is on the Red team. C saw everything up until they left, so C knows the basket contains a stapler. C will likely answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - costs nothing, but C will likely answer correctly (Red gets 1 point)
2. **Tell(C, basket, [wrong contents])** - costs 0.5 points, but C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team), so this probably won't work
3. **Ask** - doesn't help here

Since C is on the opposing team, they have no incentive to believe any misinformation I give them. C knows what's in the basket because they witnessed D put the stapler there.

5. D puts stapler in basket
6. C leaves the room
7. I move apple from bag to box
8. D moves apple from box to bag
9. I move apple from bag to box

So currently:
- Box contains: apple
- Basket contains: stapler
- Bag contains: empty

C left the room after step 6. At that point, C saw:
- Apple was in the bag (D moved it there in step 4)
- Stapler was in the basket (D put it there in step 5)

C doesn't know about the subsequent movements of the apple (steps 7-9), but those didn't affect the basket anyway.

So C believes the basket contains the stapler, and the basket actually DOES contain the stapler.

C will be asked what's in the basket. C should correctly answer "stapler" because:
1. C saw D put the stapler in the basket before leaving
2. The stapler is still in the basket

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's any way to help my team or hurt the Red team.

I could try to Tell C false information, but C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). C saw the stapler go into the basket with their own eyes, so they're unlikely to believe me if I tell them something different.

Current state:

- Bag: empty

What C knows about the basket:
- C saw D put the apple in the basket initially
- C saw D move the apple from basket to bag
- C saw D put the stapler in the basket
- C left after this, so C's last knowledge of the basket is that it contains the **stapler**

Since C will be asked about the basket, and C correctly believes the basket contains the stapler (which is true - nothing happened to the basket after C left), C will likely answer correctly.

C is on the Red team, so if C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

I could try to Tell C false information to mislead them, but C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). C saw the stapler being placed in the basket and has no reason to doubt that knowledge.

Since C already has correct information about the basket, and telling C something false is unlikely to change their answer (they'd trust their own observation over an opponent's claim), spending 0.5 points on a Tell action would likely be wasted.

Current state: ball is in box, stapler is in basket, bag is empty.

C will be asked what's in the basket. What does C believe is in the basket?
- C last saw: ball moved to bag, stapler put in basket
- C left before any further movements
- So C believes the stapler is in the basket

The actual contents: stapler is in the basket (after D moved it back)

So C will likely answer "stapler" which is actually correct! This would give the Red team 1 point.

Should I try to deceive C? If I tell C something false about the basket, C might change their answer. But C is on the opposing team and might not trust me, or might realize I'm trying to deceive them.

If I Tell C that something else is in the basket (like the ball), C might:
- Distrust me and stick with their belief (stapler) - Red scores
- Believe me and say ball - Red doesn't score

The risk is spending 0.5 points on a deception that might not work. C knows I'm on the opposing team and has no reason to trust me.

I think the best play is to Pass here, since any action costs points and C is likely to be suspicious of information from an opponent.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Current situation:
- I put a banana in the basket
- D left the room AFTER I put the banana in the basket, so D saw me put the banana in the basket
- D will be asked what is in the basket
- D knows the correct answer (banana)

Since D is on the Red team and knows the correct answer, D will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for the Red team.

My options:
1. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but D will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point
2. **Tell(D, basket, [wrong item])** - Costs 0.5 points, but D saw me put the banana in the basket, so D knows I'm lying and will ignore my misinformation
3. **Ask** - Doesn't help in this situation

The key insight is that D was in the room when I put the banana in the basket. D has direct knowledge of what's in the basket. Any attempt to mislead D would be futile because D witnessed the action firsthand.

Since I cannot change the outcome (D will answer correctly regardless of what I do), I should not waste points on a Tell action that won't work.

Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. I put a banana in the basket (everyone in room saw this: me, B, C, D)
2. D leaves the room
3. C puts a stapler in the bag (D doesn't see this)
4. I move the stapler from bag to box (D doesn't see this)
5. B moves the stapler from box to bag (D doesn't see this)

Current state:
- Basket: banana
- Bag: stapler
- Box: empty

What does D know?
- D saw me put a banana in the basket
- D left before any other actions
- D knows the basket contains a banana

The question will be asked to D: "What is in the basket?"

D should correctly answer "banana" since D saw me put it there and left before anything else happened. The banana was never moved.

Since D (a Red team player) will likely answer correctly and score a point for Red, I should consider if there's any action I can take to prevent this.

However, I cannot communicate with D (opponent) to mislead them - well, I *can* Tell them false information, but that would cost 0.5 points and D might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team.

If I Tell(D, basket, [something wrong]), it costs 0.5 points and D might ignore it since I'm an opponent trying to mislead them.

The expected value of telling D false info: -0.5 points guaranteed, with uncertain benefit (D may not believe me).

Since D likely knows the correct answer already, spending 0.5 points to potentially mislead them is risky. D has no reason to trust an opponent.

Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a banana in the basket (D was present for this)
- D left the room
- After D left: orange movements happened (bag → box → bag → box)
- The banana is still in the basket (it was never moved)

**What D knows:**
- D saw me put the banana in the basket before leaving
- D doesn't know about any orange movements (happened after D left)
- D should correctly know the basket contains a banana

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the basket.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask D what is in the basket."

So D will be asked about the basket contents. D saw me put the banana in the basket before leaving, and nothing happened to the basket after D left. D should correctly answer "banana" and the Red team would get 1 point.

**Should I take an action?**
- If I Tell D something false, D might give a wrong answer, but D is on the Red team - they have no reason to trust me and lying to them could backfire or they'd just ignore it.
- If I Ask someone something, it costs 0.5 points but doesn't help here.
- D has accurate information about the basket (banana), so there's nothing I can do to help my team here.

Since D knows the correct answer (banana is in the basket), and D is on the opposing team, any action I take would either cost my team points or potentially help the Red team. The best choice is to Pass.

Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

C moves the ball from the basket to the bag. ... B puts a stapler in the basket. ... C moves the stapler from the basket to the box. ... B moves the ball from the bag to the basket. ...

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. I put a ball in the basket
2. D leaves the room
3. C moves the ball from basket to bag
4. B puts a stapler in the basket
5. C moves the stapler from basket to box
6. B moves the ball from bag to basket

So currently: basket has the ball, box has the stapler, bag is empty.

D left the room after I put the ball in the basket. From D's perspective:
- D saw me put the ball in the basket
- D doesn't know about any movements after leaving

So D thinks the basket still contains the ball (which happens to be correct now, but for the wrong reasons - D doesn't know about all the intermediate movements).

Since D will be asked about the basket, and D believes the ball is there (based on what D saw before leaving), and the ball IS actually there now, D will likely answer "ball" which is correct.

This means the Red team will get 1 point if D answers correctly.

Should I try to mislead D? I could Tell D false information about the basket. But D is on the opposing team - would D trust information from me? Probably not, since I'm on the opposing team and D knows I might lie.

If I Tell D something false like "the basket has the stapler," D might:
1. Distrust me and stick with their original belief (ball) - they'd be correct
2. Believe me and answer stapler - they'd be wrong

Since D has no reason to trust me (opposing team), telling false info likely won't work and costs 0.5 points.

The best action is to Pass - don't waste points on an action that's unlikely to succeed.

Pass
D answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

2. D leaves the room
3. B moves the ball from the bag to the box (D doesn't see this)
4. C puts a banana in the bag (D doesn't see this)
5. B leaves the room

Current state: The bag contains a banana, the box contains the ball.

D's perspective: D saw me put a ball in the bag, then left. D doesn't know about any changes after that. D likely thinks the ball is still in the bag.

The question will be asked to D (Red team) about what's in the bag.
- The correct answer is: banana
- D likely thinks: ball (based on what D saw before leaving)

If D answers "ball," D will be wrong, and Red team gets 0 points.

Since D is on the opposing team and is likely to answer incorrectly (thinking the ball is still in the bag when it's actually a banana), this is good for my team. I should not help D by telling them the correct answer.

I should Pass - there's no benefit to spending points on an action here. D will likely answer incorrectly, which benefits my team.

So C will be asked directly. C is on the Red team. C will likely answer "banana" because that's what C last saw in the bag before leaving. But the actual contents are a ball.

1. **Pass** - costs nothing. C will probably answer "banana" (wrong), so Red gets 0 points.
2. **Tell(C, bag, ball)** - costs 0.5 points. This would help C answer correctly, giving Red 1 point. Net effect: Red gains 0.5 points relative to us. Bad idea.
3. **Tell(C, bag, banana)** - costs 0.5 points. C already thinks this, so it's redundant and wastes our points.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a banana in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... D puts a ball in the bag. ... You move the banana from the box to the basket. ... You move the banana from the basket to the box. ...

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. C puts a banana in the bag (everyone sees this)
2. B leaves the room
3. C leaves the room
4. D moves the banana from the bag to the box (only I and D see this)
5. D puts a ball in the bag (only I and D see this)
6. I move the banana from the box to the basket (only I and D see this)
7. I move the banana from the basket to the box (only I and D see this)

Current state:
- Bag: ball
- Box: banana
- Basket: empty

What does C know?
C left after putting the banana in the bag. C doesn't know about any movements after leaving. C will likely answer "banana" for the bag, which is incorrect (the bag now contains a ball).

Since C is on the Red team and will be asked about the bag, C will likely answer incorrectly (saying "banana" when it's actually "ball"). This is good for my Blue team - we want C to answer wrong.

If I Tell C the truth about the bag containing a ball, I would be helping the Red team score a point, which would hurt my team. That would cost us 0.5 points AND help them get 1 point.

If I Pass, C will likely answer "banana" (wrong), and Red team gets 0 points.

The optimal action is to Pass - let C answer incorrectly based on their outdated information.

Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

What I know:
- C put a brick in the box, then left the room
- After C left, D moved the brick around and eventually put it in the bag
- D then put a ball in the box
- So the box currently contains a ball

What C knows:
- C saw themselves put a brick in the box
- C left the room before D moved anything
- C doesn't know about D's movements or that D put a ball in the box
- C likely believes the brick is still in the box

I'm on the Blue team (with B), and C is on the Red team.

The question will be asked to C: "What is in the box?"

C will likely answer "brick" because that's what C believes is in the box (C wasn't present when D moved things around).

The correct answer is "ball" - so C will likely get it wrong, meaning the Red team won't score.

Since C is likely to answer incorrectly on their own (benefiting my team), I should Pass. There's no need to spend points on an action when the outcome is already favorable to my team.

Pass
C answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

Action: I need to analyze this situation strategically.

**What I know:**
- D put an orange in the bag (while everyone was in the room)
- D left the room
- C left the room
- After C left, I moved the orange from the bag to the box
- After C left, B put a ball in the bag

**What C knows:**
- C saw D put an orange in the bag
- C left before I moved the orange and before B put the ball in the bag
- So C believes the bag contains the orange

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag.

**Current reality:** The bag contains a ball.

**C's likely answer:** C will probably say "orange" because that's what C last saw in the bag before leaving.

**Strategic analysis:**
- C is on the Red team (my opponent)
- If C answers "orange," C will be wrong (the bag has a ball), and Red gets 0 points
- This is good for my team!

I should **Pass** because:
1. C doesn't know the bag's contents changed
2. C will likely answer incorrectly
3. Any action I take costs points and could potentially help the opposing team
4. I have no incentive to tell C the truth

Pass
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put an orange in the bag, then left
- C left after D
- After both C and D left, several movements happened:
  - I moved the orange from bag to box
  - B put a ball in the bag
  - I moved the orange from box to basket
  - B moved the orange from basket to box
  - I moved the orange from box to basket

**Current state:**
- Bag contains: ball
- Basket contains: orange
- Box contains: empty

**What C knows:**
C only saw D put the orange in the bag before leaving. C is unaware of all the movements that happened after they left. So C believes the orange is still in the bag.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag.

C will likely answer "orange" (based on their last knowledge), but the actual answer is "ball". So C will answer incorrectly, which is good for my team (Blue).

**Should I take an action?**
- If I Tell C the truth (that the bag has a ball), it would cost 0.5 points and help the Red team score 1 point, resulting in a net loss for Blue.
- If I Pass, C will likely answer "orange" incorrectly, Red gets 0 points, and Blue loses nothing.

Let me trace what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room

3. D leaves the room
4. C leaves the room

Current state: The bag contains a ball, the box contains a brick, the basket is empty.

C's perspective: C last saw D put a brick in the bag, then C left. C doesn't know about any movements after that. So C believes the bag contains a brick.

The question will be asked to C about what's in the bag. C will likely answer "brick" based on their last knowledge, but the actual answer is "ball" - so C will be wrong, which is good for my team (Blue).

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly (they think it's a brick, but it's actually a ball), this benefits my Blue team. I don't need to spend points to help C get the right answer - that would hurt my team.

I should Pass, as there's no benefit to spending points here. C answering incorrectly means Red doesn't get a point, which is the best outcome for Blue without costing us anything.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room when D put an orange in the box
- I was in the room when C put a ball in the basket
- Then I left, followed by B leaving

**What C knows:**
- C was in the room the entire time (never mentioned leaving)
- C saw D put an orange in the box
- C put a ball in the basket

**The question:** I will ask C what is in the box.

C was present when D put the orange in the box, so C knows the answer is "orange." C is on the Red team, so C will answer correctly to earn 1 point for the Red team.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but C will likely answer correctly and Red gets 1 point
2. **Ask** - Would cost 0.5 points, but I already know what's in the box
3. **Tell** - Could try to deceive C, but C already knows the truth since C was in the room

Since C was in the room when the orange was placed in the box, C has direct knowledge of the contents. Any attempt to deceive C through a Tell action would be pointless because C knows the truth from direct observation.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly. Spending 0.5 points on an action would only hurt my team without any benefit.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what each player knows:

**What happened:**
1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. D puts brick in bag (everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room
4. D moves brick from bag to basket (C doesn't see this)
5. C enters the room
6. D moves brick from basket to bag (C sees this)
7. I (A) leave the room
8. B leaves the room

**What C knows:**
- C saw D put brick in bag initially
- C left, so missed the move to basket
- C returned and saw D move brick from basket to bag
- So C knows the brick is currently in the bag

**Current state:** The brick is in the bag.

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the bag.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask C what is in the bag."

So C will be answering about the bag's contents. C saw the brick moved from basket to bag when C returned, so C knows the brick is in the bag. C should answer correctly.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's anything I can do. 

However, I can only communicate with players, not change what C knows. If I Tell C false information, C might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team. Also, C directly witnessed the final state of the brick being in the bag.

Since C has direct knowledge of the brick being in the bag (C saw D move it there), any attempt to mislead C would likely fail and cost my team 0.5 points.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points on an action that won't help.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Let me analyze the situation:
- I put a banana in the basket while everyone (B, C, and D) was in the room
- Then I left the room
- C was in the room when I put the banana in the basket, so C knows the banana is in the basket
- The question will be asked to C about what's in the basket

Since C was present when I put the banana in the basket, C knows the correct answer (banana). C is on the Red team, so if C answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point.

My options:
1. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but C will likely answer correctly and Red gets 1 point
2. **Tell(C, basket, [wrong item])** - Costs 0.5 points, but C already knows the truth since they were in the room, so this won't deceive them
3. **Ask** - Doesn't help in this situation

Since C was in the room and witnessed me putting the banana in the basket, C already knows the correct answer. Any Tell action to C would be pointless because C has direct knowledge of what happened. C won't be fooled by false information since they saw the action themselves.

The best action is to Pass, as spending 0.5 points on a Tell action that won't work is wasteful.

So C (a Red team player) will be asked about the basket contents. C was present for everything and saw me put a banana in the basket. C knows the correct answer is "banana."

Since C is on the opposing team and knows the correct answer, C will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for the Red team.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but C will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point
2. **Tell(C, basket, [wrong item])** - This costs 0.5 points, but C has no reason to believe me over their own observations. C saw me put the banana there and nothing else happened to the basket. C would ignore my lie.
3. **Ask** - Doesn't help here

Since C directly witnessed me putting the banana in the basket and nothing happened to the basket after that, C has perfect knowledge. Any attempt to deceive C would be futile - C knows what they saw.

The best action is to save my points since I cannot influence C's correct answer.

**Pass**
C answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a banana in the basket. ... C puts a ball in the bag. ...

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. I put a banana in the basket
2. C put a ball in the bag
3. B moved the ball from the bag to the box
4. D moved the ball from the box to the bag
5. I moved the ball from the bag to the box
6. I left the room

Current state of containers:
- Basket: banana
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty

C was in the room the entire time and saw everything, including me putting the banana in the basket. So C knows the basket contains a banana.

The question will be asked to C (Red team) about what's in the basket. C knows the correct answer (banana) and will likely answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

My options:
1. **Pass** - C will answer correctly, Red gets 1 point
2. **Tell(C, basket, [wrong item])** - Try to deceive C, but C saw me put the banana there, so C won't be fooled
3. **Ask** - Doesn't help here

Since C was present when I put the banana in the basket, C has direct knowledge of the contents. Any attempt to deceive C would be futile because C witnessed the action firsthand. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell action that won't work would just hurt my team.

Pass
C answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. I put an orange in the basket (everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room
4. D moves the orange from basket to bag (C doesn't see this - only A, B, D see it)
5. C enters the room
6. I move the orange from bag to basket (everyone in room sees this - A, B, C, D)
7. I leave the room

So the current state is: orange is in the basket.

What does C know?
- C saw me put orange in basket initially
- C left, so missed D moving orange to bag
- C returned and saw me move orange from bag to basket
- C knows the orange is currently in the basket

Since C was in the room when I moved the orange from the bag to the basket, C directly witnessed this action. C knows the orange is in the basket.

The question will be asked to C about what's in the basket. C should know the correct answer (orange) because C was present when I made the final move.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), and there's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly (C already has the correct information), spending 0.5 points to Tell or Ask wouldn't help my team.

Pass
C answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. Initially: empty bag, empty box, empty basket
2. D puts a brick in the basket → basket has brick
3. I leave the room (I'm unaware of what happens while I'm out)
4. I enter the room
5. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket → This means while I was out, the brick must have been moved to the bag, and now C moved it back to the basket
6. C leaves the room

So from what I directly observed after re-entering:
- C moved the brick FROM the bag TO the basket
- This means the basket currently contains the brick

Wait, let me reconsider. The scenario says "C moves the brick from the bag to the basket." This tells me:
- The brick was in the bag (must have been moved there while I was outside)
- C moved it to the basket
- So the basket now contains the brick

I know the answer to the question - the basket contains the brick. I observed this directly when C moved the brick to the basket while I was in the room.

Since I already know the answer and will be asked about the basket, I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

The question will be asking me what is in the basket. I saw C put an orange in the basket, and nothing else happened to the basket after that.

So the basket contains: **orange**

Since I directly witnessed C putting the orange in the basket and nothing else happened to the basket, I know the answer with certainty. I don't need to ask anyone for information, and I don't need to tell anyone anything since I'm the one being asked.

Pass
A answers: orange
Correct! The basket contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a ball in the basket. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... C moves the ball from the bag to the basket. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. I, B, C, and D are all in the room initially
2. C puts a ball in the basket (I see this)
3. I leave the room
4. (Something may have happened while I was out - I wouldn't know)
5. I enter the room
6. C moves the ball from the bag to the basket

Wait, there's something interesting here. When I re-entered, I saw "C moves the ball from the bag to the basket." But before I left, the ball was in the basket (C put it there). This means while I was outside, someone must have moved the ball from the basket to the bag. I wasn't aware of this move, but the scenario describes what I see when I return.

So the sequence is:
1. Ball goes to basket (I saw this)
2. I leave
3. Ball moved from basket to bag (I didn't see this, but it must have happened)
4. I return
5. Ball moves from bag to basket (I saw this)

So currently, the ball is in the basket.

Since I'm going to be asked what's in the basket, and I know the answer (the ball is in the basket), I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

Pass
A answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Now, what does each player know about the basket?
- **Me (A)**: I know there's a ball in the basket (I put it there)
- **B**: B was outside when I put the ball in the basket, so B doesn't know what's in it
- **C**: C was outside when I put the ball in the basket, so C doesn't know what's in it
- **D**: D was in the room the whole time and saw me put the ball in the basket

The question will be asked to me: "What is in the basket?"

I know the answer - there's a ball in the basket. I don't need to ask anyone or tell anyone anything to answer this question correctly.

Since I already know the answer and I'm the one being asked, I should Pass to avoid spending any points unnecessarily.

3. C leaves the room
4. I (A) put a brick in the basket
5. B enters the room

9. D moves the brick from the basket to the bag
10. C moves the brick from the bag to the basket
11. D leaves the room
12. D enters the room
13. I leave the room (current state)

So the brick is currently in the basket. I witnessed all the movements while I was in the room, including:
- I put the brick in the basket
- D moved it to the bag
- C moved it back to the basket

The final state is: brick is in the basket.

I'm being asked what is in the basket, and I know the answer is "brick" because I saw C move it back to the basket before I left.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put an orange in the basket
- When I put the orange in the basket, B had already left the room, so B doesn't know what's in the basket
- C and D were in the room when I put the orange in the basket, so they know what's in the basket

**The question:**
I will be asked what is in the basket.

**My analysis:**
Since I'm the one who put the orange in the basket, I know exactly what's in it - an orange. I don't need to ask anyone or tell anyone anything to answer this question correctly.

Taking an Ask or Tell action would cost my team 0.5 points unnecessarily, since I already have the information I need to answer correctly and earn 1 point.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room when I put an orange in the basket
- I saw C put a brick in the box
- B left before any objects were placed, so B doesn't know what's in any container
- After I left, I don't know if anything else happened in the room

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the basket.

**My knowledge:** I put an orange in the basket. However, after I left the room, C and D were still inside (C was there when I left, and D was there the whole time). They could have moved the orange or replaced it with something else.

But wait - let me re-read the scenario. It says "You leave the room. ..." with ellipses, but nothing is described after that. Since I'm outside the room, I wouldn't see what happens inside, but the scenario would still describe players entering or leaving. No such movements are described.

**Key insight:** I know for certain that I put an orange in the basket. The question is being asked to ME, and I have direct knowledge of this. Even if C or D moved things after I left, I still know what I put there, and the scenario doesn't indicate any changes occurred (though they could have happened without my knowledge).

Since I'm the one being asked and I have firsthand knowledge that I put an orange in the basket, I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions. I should save our team's points.

**My action:** Pass

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room when I put an orange in the basket
- I was in the room when D put a brick in the box
- I left the room after these events
- B left before I put the orange in the basket, so B doesn't know what's in the basket

**What happened after I left:**
- I don't know if anything changed after I left the room
- C and D were still in the room when I left, so they could have moved objects

**The question:**
I will be asked what is in the basket. When I left, the basket contained an orange (I put it there myself).

**Should I take an action?**
- Since I put the orange in the basket myself, I know it was there when I left
- However, I don't know if C or D moved it after I left
- I could Ask C or D what's in the basket now, but that costs 0.5 points
- If I'm confident the orange is still there, I should Pass and save the points

**Risk assessment:**
- C and D are on the opposing team - they might lie if I ask them
- The scenario doesn't mention any activity after I left, which suggests nothing changed
- I have direct knowledge that I put the orange in the basket

Since I personally put the orange in the basket and there's no indication anything happened after I left (the scenario ends with "You leave the room. ..."), I'm confident the orange is still there. Asking opponents would cost points and they might lie anyway.

2. B puts a banana in the bag
3. I move the banana from the bag to the basket
4. D moves the banana from the basket to the bag
5. B moves the banana from the bag to the basket
6. I leave the room

So when I left, the box contained an orange, and the basket contained a banana.

After I left, D left the room. I don't know if anything happened between when I left and when D left, since I was outside the room.

However, the question is asking ME what is in the box. I saw D put an orange in the box, and I never saw anyone remove it before I left. The only movements after that involved the banana moving between the bag and basket.

Since I'm being asked directly about the box, and I know the answer (orange), I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

Pass
A answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C leaves the room. ... D puts a ball in the bag. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... D moves the ball from the bag to the box. ... D moves the ball from the box to the bag. ... You leave the room. ... D leaves the room. ...

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag based on what I observed.

Let me trace through what I saw:
1. I was in the room with B, C, and D. C left.
2. D put a ball in the bag (I saw this)
3. I left the room
4. I entered the room
5. D moved the ball from the bag to the box (I saw this)
6. D moved the ball from the box to the bag (I saw this)
7. I left the room
8. D left the room

So the last thing I observed was D moving the ball back to the bag. After I left, D also left the room. Since D left after me, D couldn't have moved anything after I left (D would need to be in the room to move objects).

Therefore, based on my observations, the ball should still be in the bag.

I'm confident in my answer, so there's no need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

Pass
A answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. I (A), B, and C were all in the room initially
2. C put a brick in the basket - I saw this
3. B put a banana in the box - I saw this
4. I moved the banana from the box to the bag - I did this
5. B moved the banana from the bag to the box - I saw this
6. I left the room

So when I left, the basket contained a brick (C put it there, and nothing else happened to the basket).

Since I'm going to be asked what's in the basket, and I directly witnessed C putting a brick in the basket, and nothing else happened to the basket while I was in the room, I know the answer is "brick."

However, I left the room, so I need to consider if anything could have happened after I left. The scenario ends with "..." after I leave, but no additional actions are described to me. Since I'm outside the room, I wouldn't be told about container changes, but I would be told about players entering or leaving.

The question is: did anything happen to the basket after I left? I can't know for certain since I left the room. But based on what I observed, the brick was in the basket.

Since I already know what was in the basket when I left (a brick), and I have no information suggesting it changed, I don't need to spend points asking anyone. I should save our team's points.

Let me trace what happened while I was in the room:
1. C puts a brick in the basket
2. B puts an apple in the bag
3. C moves the apple from the bag to the box
4. C moves the apple from the box to the bag
5. B moves the apple from the bag to the box
6. I leave the room

So when I left, the state was:
- Basket: brick
- Box: apple
- Bag: empty

After I left the room, I don't know what happened (indicated by "..."). Something may have changed, but I can't see it.

However, the question is asking ME what is in the basket. I need to answer based on my knowledge. When I left, the brick was in the basket, and I have no information suggesting it moved after I left.

Since I'm being asked the question and I believe I know the answer (brick in the basket), I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions. The basket contents (brick) didn't change while I was watching - only the apple moved around between the bag and box.

Action: I need to figure out what's in the basket.

Let me trace through what I observed:
1. I was in the room with B and C
2. C put a stapler in the basket
3. I left the room
4. I entered the room (at this point, I don't know what happened while I was out)
5. C moved the stapler from the basket to the bag (so now stapler is in the bag)
6. C moved the stapler from the bag to the basket (so now stapler is in the basket)
7. I left the room

After I left the room the second time, I don't know if anything else happened. The scenario ends with "..." after I leave, which could mean something happened that I'm not aware of.

However, based on what I last observed before leaving, the stapler was in the basket. But I'm uncertain if C (who was still in the room) moved anything after I left.

B was in the room the entire time (the scenario never mentions B leaving), so B would know the current state of all containers.

Since I'm uncertain about what happened after I left, and B stayed in the room, I should ask B what's in the basket to be sure.

Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a brick in the basket while everyone was in the room
- B then left the room
- D then left the room
- I (A) and C are still in the room

**What B knows:**
- B put the brick in the basket
- B left the room, so B doesn't know if anything changed after they left
- However, nothing did change after B left - the brick is still in the basket

**The question:**
I will be asked what's in the basket, and B will answer.

**Analysis:**
B knows they put a brick in the basket. B left the room, but B would know that only D left after them (B can track who enters/leaves even from outside). Since no one who remained in the room (me and C) would have reason to move the brick that B knows about, B should correctly answer "brick."

Since B witnessed putting the brick in the basket and nothing happened after B left that would change the basket's contents, B should answer correctly without any help from me.

**Decision:**
There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something they already know. B saw themselves put the brick in the basket and should remember this.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the basket.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the basket."

So B will be asked about the basket. B put a brick in the basket and then left. Nothing happened to the basket after B left - the ball movements were between the bag and box only.

**Current state:**
- Basket: brick
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty

B knows the brick is in the basket because B put it there, and B has no reason to think it moved (B was outside the room but would have been told if anyone entered/left, and no one did anything to the basket).

B should correctly answer "brick" for the basket.

- B put a banana in the basket, then left the room
- After B left: C moved the banana from basket to bag, D put an orange in basket, C moved orange from basket to box, D moved banana from bag to basket, then D left
- Currently: The basket contains the banana

**What B knows:**
- B only saw themselves put a banana in the basket, then left
- B doesn't know about any movements that happened after they left
- B would believe the basket still contains the banana

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the basket.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the basket."

So B will be asked directly. B believes the banana is in the basket (since B left before any changes). The actual contents of the basket IS the banana (D moved it back).

So B will answer "banana" and that's actually correct! The basket does contain the banana.

This means B will answer correctly without any help from me, earning our team 1 point.

If I use Tell to inform B, it would cost 0.5 points, and B would still answer "banana" (either from their own belief or from my information). Net gain would be 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 points.

If I Pass, B answers "banana" based on their own belief, which happens to be correct. Net gain would be 1 - 0 = 1 point.

The optimal action is to Pass, since B's belief aligns with reality in this case.

Current state:
- Box: brick
- Basket: apple
- Bag: empty

What does B know?
- B saw D put apple in box
- B moved apple from box to bag
- B put brick in box
- B left before any further movements

So B believes:
- Box: brick
- Bag: apple
- Basket: empty

The question is: What is in the box?

B will be asked what's in the box. B believes (correctly!) that the brick is in the box, because B put it there and nothing happened to the box after B left.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put an apple in the box, then left
- B moved the apple from box to bag, then put a brick in the box, then left
- C moved the apple from bag to basket
- I moved the apple from basket to bag
- C moved the apple from bag to basket

**Current state:**
- Box contains: brick
- Basket contains: apple
- Bag contains: empty

**What B knows:**
B left after putting the brick in the box. At that point:
- Box had brick
- Bag had apple
- Basket was empty

B doesn't know about the movements that happened after they left.

**The question:** B will be asked what's in the box.

B should correctly answer "brick" because that's what B put there, and B has no reason to think it changed (B was outside when subsequent movements happened, and those movements didn't involve the box anyway).

Since B already knows the correct answer (brick is in the box, and B put it there), I don't need to spend points telling B this information.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a banana in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... B puts a brick in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the banana from the box to the basket. ... C moves the brick from the bag to the box. ...

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. D puts a banana in the bag (everyone sees this)
2. D leaves the room
3. B moves the banana from the bag to the box (B, C, and I see this)
4. B puts a brick in the bag (B, C, and I see this)
5. B leaves the room
6. C moves the banana from the box to the basket (only C and I see this)
7. C moves the brick from the bag to the box (only C and I see this)
8. C moves the brick from the box to the bag (only C and I see this)

Current state of containers:
- Bag: brick
- Box: empty
- Basket: banana

What B knows:
- B left after putting the brick in the bag and moving the banana to the box
- B doesn't know about C's movements after B left
- B thinks: bag = brick, box = banana, basket = empty

So when asked "what is in the bag?", B would likely answer "brick" based on B's knowledge, which is actually correct! The brick is currently in the bag.

Wait, let me re-trace C's movements:
- C moves brick from bag to box
- C moves brick from box to bag

So the brick ended up back in the bag. B thinks the brick is in the bag, and it actually IS in the bag.

B will likely answer "brick" which is correct. This means our team will get 1 point without me needing to spend 0.5 points to tell B anything.

Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

**The question:** I will be asked what's in the basket, and B will answer.

B saw me put the apple in the basket, and nothing happened to the basket after that. So B should correctly know that the basket contains the apple.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a banana in the basket initially
- B left the room before D made any moves
- After B left, D moved things around:
  - Moved banana from basket to bag
  - Put brick in basket
  - Moved brick from basket to box
  - Moved banana from bag to basket

**Current state of containers:**
- Basket: banana
- Bag: empty
- Box: brick

**What B believes:**
B only saw me put the banana in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about any of D's movements. So B thinks the basket still contains the banana.

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the basket.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the basket."

So B will be asked about the basket contents. B believes the banana is still in the basket (which happens to be correct now, since D moved it back). 

B's belief: banana is in the basket
Actual contents: banana is in the basket

B will likely answer "banana" and be correct! This would give our Blue team 1 point.

Since B's belief aligns with reality (the banana is indeed in the basket), B should answer correctly without any help from me. Using a Tell action would cost us 0.5 points unnecessarily.

**Decision:** I should Pass to save points since B will likely answer correctly anyway.

- Then D put a ball in the basket

**What I know:**
- The bag contains: a brick (D put it there)
- The box contains: empty (banana was moved out)
- The basket contains: a banana (I moved it there last)

**What B knows:**
B left the room after D put the banana in the bag, but before:

- D put a brick in the bag

So B thinks the bag still contains a banana (which is wrong - it now contains a brick).

B will likely answer "banana" based on their outdated knowledge, but the correct answer is "brick."

**Should I tell B?**

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a banana in the bag. ... C leaves the room. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... D puts a brick in the bag. ... You move the banana from the box to the basket. ... You move the banana from the basket to the box. ...

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put a banana in the bag (everyone saw this)
- C left the room
- B left the room
- After B left: D moved the banana from bag to box, D put a brick in the bag
- I moved the banana from box to basket, then from basket to box

**What B knows:**
- B saw D put a banana in the bag
- B left before any other changes
- B thinks the banana is still in the bag

**Current state:**
- Bag contains: brick
- Box contains: banana
- Basket contains: empty

**The question:** B will be asked what is in the bag.

B believes the bag contains a banana, but it actually contains a brick. If B answers "banana," they'll be wrong and Blue team gets 0 points.

I should tell B what's actually in the bag so they can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point. The cost is 0.5 points, but the potential gain is 1 point, so net gain would be 0.5 points.

Tell(B, bag, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put a stapler in the bag initially
- C left the room
- B left the room
- After B left, D moved the stapler around and eventually put it in the box
- D then put a brick in the bag

**What B knows:**
- B saw D put the stapler in the bag
- B left before D moved anything
- So B believes the stapler is still in the bag

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read. "I am going to ask B what is in the bag."

So B will be asked directly. B thinks the stapler is in the bag (since B left before D moved it). But the actual contents of the bag is now a brick.

B will likely answer "stapler" because that's what B last saw. But the correct answer is "brick."

Since B is my teammate, I should tell B the correct contents of the bag so B can answer correctly and earn our team 1 point.

The cost of telling is 0.5 points, but if B answers correctly, we get 1 point. Net gain = 0.5 points.

If I don't tell B, B will likely say "stapler" which is wrong, and we get 0 points.

**My action:**

Tell(B, bag, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the box, then left the room
- After B left: D moved the apple to the basket, then C moved it back to the box, then D moved it to the bag, and finally C put a ball in the box
- The box currently contains: a ball
- B thinks the box contains: an apple (since B left before all the movements)

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the box, but actually B will be asked directly what is in the box.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the box."

B will answer based on what B knows. B left when the apple was in the box, so B will likely answer "apple" - but the correct answer is "ball."

If B answers "apple," that's wrong, and Blue team gets 0 points.

**My options:**
1. **Tell(B, box, ball)** - This costs 0.5 points but would inform B that the box now contains a ball. B could then answer correctly, earning 1 point. Net gain: 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 points.
2. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but B will likely answer "apple" (incorrect), earning 0 points.

The strategic choice is clear: I should tell B the correct contents so our team can score.

Tell(B, box, ball)
B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

The situation is straightforward here. B put the stapler in the bag while B was in the room, so B knows exactly what's in the bag. B will correctly answer "stapler" when asked about the bag's contents, earning our Blue team 1 point.

There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points on an Ask or Tell action since B already has the correct information. Passing is the optimal choice.

- I put a ball in the basket
- B moved the stapler from bag to box
- I moved the stapler from box to bag
- B moved the stapler from bag to box

**Current state:**
- Basket contains: ball
- Box contains: stapler
- Bag contains: empty

**What B knows:**
B was in the room the entire time and saw everything I saw. B knows the basket contains the ball.

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the basket, and B will be asked.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask B what is in the basket."

B knows the answer - B saw me put the ball in the basket and was present for all movements. B knows the basket contains the ball.

Since B has complete information about what's in the basket (the ball), B can answer correctly without any help from me. There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something B already knows.

**My action:** Pass

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Let me trace what happened:
1. I put a stapler in the basket (everyone saw this)
2. D leaves the room
3. C leaves the room
4. B moves the stapler from basket to bag (only B and I saw this)

9. B moves the stapler from bag to box (only B and I saw this)

Wait, let me re-trace step 9: "B moves the stapler from the box to the bag"

Final state:
- Basket: ball
- Bag: stapler
- Box: empty

B was in the room the entire time with me, so B knows:
- The basket contains the ball

Since B is my teammate and was present for all the movements, B knows exactly what's in the basket (the ball). B will answer correctly.

I should Pass since B already knows the correct answer and there's no need to spend 0.5 points on communication.

- B saw me put a ball in the basket

So B knows:
- B moved the orange from the basket to the box
- B saw me put a ball in the basket

B should know that the basket contains a ball.

Since B directly witnessed me putting the ball in the basket (B was in the room at that time), B should be able to answer correctly that the basket contains a ball.

ACTION PHASE

In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Initially: A (me), B, and D are in the room. D puts a ball in the bag.
2. B leaves the room.
3. While B is outside: D moves the ball from the bag to the box.
4. B enters the room.
5. After B returns: D moves the ball from the box to the bag.

What B knows:
- B saw D put the ball in the bag initially
- B was outside when the ball was moved to the box
- B returned and saw D move the ball from the box to the bag

So B actually witnessed the final move (ball from box to bag) and knows the ball is currently in the bag.

The current state: The ball is in the bag.

B will be asked what is in the bag. B knows the ball is in the bag because:
- B saw the initial placement (ball in bag)
- B missed the move to the box
- B saw the final move (ball from box to bag)

So B should correctly answer "ball" for the bag.

Since B already has the correct information to answer the question, I don't need to spend points to Tell B anything. The optimal action is to Pass.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

**What I know:**
- I saw D put a stapler in the basket (I was in the room when this happened)

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a brick in the basket while everyone (B, C, D) was in the room
- Then I left the room
- Then B left the room
- C and D remained in the room after B and I left

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put the brick in the basket (B was in the room when this happened)
- B doesn't know what happened after B left (C and D were still in the room and could have moved things)

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the basket.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the basket."

So B will be asked about the basket. B saw me put the brick in the basket. However, after B left, C and D were still in the room and could have moved the brick or put something else in the basket.

**Key consideration:** B knows the brick was in the basket when B left, but B doesn't know if C or D changed anything after B left.

Since B was present when I put the brick in the basket, B should know the answer was "brick" at the time B left. B might be uncertain about whether it changed after.

Should I tell B anything? B already knows I put a brick in the basket. The risk is that C or D moved it after we both left.

However, I don't know what happened after I left either - C and D could have changed things. Telling B "brick" doesn't add new information since B already saw this.

The best action is to **Pass** - B already has the same information I have about the basket (we both saw the brick go in, and neither of us knows what happened after we left). Spending 0.5 points to tell B something B already knows would be wasteful.

**Pass**
B answers: brick
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

After I left the room, C and D were still in the room with B. Something could have happened before B left that B would know about but I wouldn't. However, B was present when I put the brick in the basket, so B should know the basket contains a brick.

However, I should consider: could something have changed after I left? If C or D moved the brick after I left but before B left, B would know about it. But I wouldn't know about any such change.

Since B was in the room the entire time the brick was in the basket (and would have seen any changes before leaving), B has complete information about the basket's contents. I don't need to communicate anything.

**Pass**
B answers: brick
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a brick in the basket. ... B puts a stapler in the box. ... You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a brick in the basket (I saw this)
- B put a stapler in the box (I saw this)
- Then I left the room, then B left the room
- After we both left, C and D were still in the room (they were there from the start and never left)

**What could have happened after I left:**
- C and D could have moved objects around while B and I were outside
- B was still in the room briefly after I left, so B would have seen anything that happened before B left
- But after B left, C and D could have done anything without either of us knowing

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put a brick in the basket
- B saw themselves put a stapler in the box
- B may have seen C or D do something after I left but before B left
- B doesn't know what happened after B left

**The question is for B: What is in the basket?**

B saw me put a brick in the basket. However, after B left, C and D could have changed things. But B would answer based on what B last knew - which is that the brick is in the basket.

Since B was present when I put the brick in the basket, B should know the answer was "brick" at the time B left. B doesn't need any additional information from me about what was in the basket.

The risk is that C or D moved the brick after B left, but neither B nor I would know about that.

Since B already has the same information I have about the basket, telling B won't help. Passing saves us 0.5 points.

**Pass**
B answers: brick
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. I, B, C, and D were all in the room
2. I put a stapler in the basket (everyone saw this)
3. I left the room
4. B left the room
5. D left the room (only C remained in the room)
6. D entered the room (C and D in room)
7. B entered the room (B, C, D in room)
8. B left the room

The key question is: what happened to the basket while I was outside the room?

When I left, B, C, and D were still inside. Then B left, then D left (leaving only C). Then D came back, then B came back briefly before leaving again.

During the time I was outside, C (and later D) could have moved the stapler. I don't know what happened because I wasn't in the room.

B was in the room at the start when I put the stapler in the basket, so B knows the stapler was originally there. But B also left the room, and when B re-entered, B would have seen the current state of the room at that moment. However, B wouldn't necessarily know if something changed while B was outside.

Actually, B re-entered the room with C and D present. B would see the current state but wouldn't know if anything changed during B's absence.

Since I put the stapler in the basket and B witnessed this, B knows the original contents. But B might be uncertain if it changed while B was out.

I should tell B what I put in the basket to confirm B's knowledge, since B will be asked about it. B saw me put the stapler there, so B should already know this. However, B might be uncertain if it was moved.

Since B witnessed me putting the stapler in the basket, B should know this. I'll Pass to save points, as B already has this information.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put an orange in the bag (I saw this)
- B left the room, then D left the room
- D knows what's in the bag (D put the orange there)

**What D knows:**
- D put the orange in the bag and then left
- Nothing happened to the bag after D left (I'm still in the room and would have seen any changes)
- So D knows the bag contains an orange

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the bag.

Since D put the orange in the bag and nothing changed after D left, D knows the bag contains an orange. D will correctly answer "orange" and the Red team will get 1 point.

**Should I take an action?**
- I could try to Tell D false information, but D has no reason to believe me (I'm on the opposing team)
- D saw themselves put the orange in the bag, so they won't be fooled by any misinformation from me
- Any Ask or Tell action would cost my team 0.5 points with no benefit

The best action is to Pass, as spending points won't change D's answer - D has direct knowledge of what's in the bag.

D answers: orange

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put an orange in the bag (while D was in the room)
- D left the room before any other movements happened
- The apple movements (basket → box → basket) happened after D left

**What D knows:**
- D knows they put an orange in the bag
- D is unaware of the apple movements since they happened after D left
- D still correctly knows the bag contains an orange

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the bag.

D put the orange in the bag and nothing has changed about the bag's contents since then. D correctly knows the bag contains an orange.

Since D will be asked about the bag, and D knows the correct answer (orange), there's no need for me to spend points to tell D information they already know. D witnessed putting the orange in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that.

**My optimal action:** Pass - D already has the correct information about the bag's contents.

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put an orange in the bag (while D was in the room)
- D left the room before any other movements happened
- The banana movements all happened after D left

**What D knows:**
- D knows they put an orange in the bag
- D doesn't know about any movements that happened after they left
- D knows B left, then D left themselves

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the bag.

D put the orange in the bag and then left. Nothing happened to the bag after D left - all the movements involved the banana between the box and basket. So D correctly knows the orange is still in the bag.

**Strategic analysis:**
- D will be asked about the bag
- D knows the orange is in the bag (D put it there and nothing changed after)
- D will likely answer correctly, giving Red team 1 point
- There's nothing I can tell D that would help my team - D is on the opposing team
- I could try to deceive D, but D has direct knowledge of putting the orange in the bag, so D is unlikely to believe me if I tell them something different

Since D has firsthand knowledge of putting the orange in the bag and left before any changes could occur to the bag, D will almost certainly answer correctly. Spending 0.5 points to try to deceive D would likely be wasted since D won't believe false information about something they directly witnessed.

**Pass**
D answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put a stapler in the box, then left the room
- After D left, C moved things around:
  - Moved stapler from box to bag
  - Put apple in box
  - Moved apple from box to basket
  - Moved stapler from bag back to box

**Current state:** The stapler is in the box (back where it started).

**What D believes:** D left when the stapler was in the box. D doesn't know about any of C's movements. So D thinks the stapler is still in the box.

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the box.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask D what is in the box."

So D will be asked directly. D believes the stapler is in the box (which happens to be correct now, since C moved it back). D will likely answer "stapler" which is correct, earning Red team 1 point.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - D will answer "stapler" (correct), Red gets 1 point
2. **Tell(D, box, something false)** - Try to deceive D into giving a wrong answer

If I tell D false information, D might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team. D knows I have incentive to deceive them.

However, D was outside the room during C's manipulations, so D might be uncertain. But D and C are teammates - D might trust that C would have informed them of changes, or D might stick with their own knowledge.

Since D's belief (stapler) matches reality, and D has no reason to trust me (an opponent), telling D false information is unlikely to work and costs 0.5 points.

**Best action:** Pass - save the points, as deception is unlikely to succeed here.

Pass
D answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room
2. C puts an apple in the bag
3. B leaves the room
4. C moves the apple from the bag to the box
5. D puts an orange in the bag
6. C leaves the room

Now, what does C know?
- C was present when they put the apple in the bag
- C was present when they moved the apple to the box
- C was present when D put the orange in the bag
- C left the room after all these events

So C knows the bag contains an orange (C saw D put it there before leaving).

The question will be asked to C about what's in the bag. C knows the correct answer (orange), so C will likely answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

Should I use Tell to try to deceive C? Since C already knows the truth (they witnessed D putting the orange in the bag), telling C false information won't help - C has direct knowledge and won't be fooled.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly. Using Tell would cost 0.5 points and wouldn't change C's knowledge since C directly observed what's in the bag.

- Basket: apple

What does C know?
- C saw: apple put in bag, then moved to box, orange put in bag
- C left before steps 7-9
- C thinks: bag has orange, box has apple, basket is empty

The question is: What is in the bag?

C will be asked what's in the bag. C believes the bag has an orange, which is CORRECT!

Since C (Red team) will answer correctly and score 1 point for Red, I should consider if there's any action I can take to help my team.

I could try to Tell C false information, but C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). C saw the orange go into the bag and has no reason to doubt it's still there.

- Box: empty
- Basket: apple

What does C believe is in the bag?
- C last saw: orange in the bag (step 5)
- C left after step 5, so C still thinks orange is in the bag

The question is: What is in the bag?
Answer: orange

C will be asked what's in the bag. C believes the orange is in the bag, and the orange IS actually in the bag. So C will likely answer "orange" which is correct.

This means Red team will get 1 point if C answers correctly.

Should I try to deceive C? I could tell C false information, but:
- C is on the Red team (opponent)
- If I tell C wrong information, C might not believe me since I'm an opponent
- It costs 0.5 points to Tell

Since C's belief (orange in bag) matches reality, C will likely answer correctly anyway. Trying to deceive C would cost us 0.5 points and C probably won't trust an opponent's information.

The best action is to Pass - there's no beneficial action I can take here.

Current actual state:

What C believes is in the box:
- C last saw: orange in the box (when C left, orange was in box, stapler was in bag)
- C doesn't know about the movements after leaving
- So C thinks the box contains: orange

The question is asking C what's in the box. C will likely answer "orange" based on their last knowledge, which happens to be correct (the orange is actually in the box now after D moved it back).

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's any action I can take to help my team.

I could try to Tell C false information, but C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). C would likely ignore my information or be suspicious.

The best action is to Pass, as spending 0.5 points to tell C something they won't believe would just cost my team points.

Pass
C answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Current situation:
- I saw C put an apple in the bag
- C then left the room
- C knows what's in the bag (the apple) because C put it there
- The question will be asked to C about the bag's contents

Since C put the apple in the bag and C knows what's in the bag, C will likely answer correctly. C is on the Red team, so if C answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point.

Let me consider my options:
1. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but C will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point
2. **Tell(C, bag, [something false])** - I could try to deceive C, but C put the apple there themselves, so C knows the truth. C won't be fooled by my lie.
3. **Ask** - Doesn't help in this situation

Since C personally put the apple in the bag, C has direct knowledge of the contents. Any attempt to deceive C would be futile - C knows what they did. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell action that won't work would just hurt my team.

The best action is to Pass and accept that Red will likely score this point.

Pass
C answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- C put an apple in the bag (C saw this)
- C left the room before any other actions
- After C left: I put a stapler in the box, B moved it to the basket, I moved it back to the box

**What C knows:**
- C put an apple in the bag
- C is unaware of anything that happened after leaving (the stapler movements)
- The bag still contains the apple (nothing changed with the bag)

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag.

C knows the apple is in the bag because C put it there, and nothing happened to the bag after C left. C should answer correctly with "apple."

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's any action I can take to help my team.

- I could try to Tell C false information about the bag, but C saw themselves put the apple in the bag, so they're unlikely to believe me.
- Any Ask or Tell action costs 0.5 points.

Since C has direct knowledge of putting the apple in the bag and nothing changed with the bag, C will almost certainly answer correctly. Spending 0.5 points to try to deceive C about something they directly witnessed would be wasteful and unlikely to work.

**Pass**
C answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- C put an apple in the bag (C saw this)
- C left the room before any other actions
- After C left: I put a brick in the box, B moved it to basket, B moved it back to box, I moved it to basket

**What C knows:**
- C put an apple in the bag
- C is unaware of anything that happened after leaving (the brick movements)

**The question:** I will ask C what is in the bag.

C should correctly answer "apple" because:
1. C put the apple in the bag
2. C left the room after that
3. Nothing happened to the bag after C left - the apple is still there
4. C has no reason to think the apple was moved

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's any action I can take to help my team.

However:
- I cannot communicate with C (opponent) to mislead them in a way that helps me
- Telling C false information would cost me 0.5 points, and C has no reason to believe me over their own memory
- C directly witnessed putting the apple in the bag and has accurate knowledge

The apple is still in the bag, and C knows this. Any action I take would cost my team 0.5 points without changing the outcome - C will correctly answer "apple" based on their own direct observation.

**Pass**
C answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. C puts a ball in the box (C, B, and I all see this)
2. C leaves the room
3. B moves the ball from the box to the bag (C doesn't see this)
4. I put an apple in the box (C doesn't see this)
5. B moves the apple from the box to the basket (C doesn't see this)
6. I move the ball from the bag to the box (C doesn't see this)

Current state:
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty
- Basket: apple

C's knowledge: C last saw the ball being put in the box, then left. C doesn't know about any subsequent movements.

C will be asked what's in the box. From C's perspective, the ball should still be in the box (which happens to be correct now, but C doesn't know about all the movements that occurred).

C is on the Red team. If C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. If C answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points.

C will likely answer "ball" based on their last observation, which is actually correct! This would give Red 1 point.

I could use Tell to try to deceive C. If I tell C something false about the box's contents, C might believe me and give a wrong answer. However, C might be suspicious since I'm on the opposing team.

Let me consider: If I tell C the box contains something else (like "apple" or "empty"), C might:
- Distrust me since I'm on the Blue team
- Or believe me and answer incorrectly

The risk is spending 0.5 points and C not believing me anyway. But if C does believe me, Red loses 1 point opportunity.

I'll try to deceive C:

Tell(C, box, apple)
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains ball.

**What I know:**
- B put a ball in the box initially
- D left the room
- After D left: B moved the ball from the box to the bag
- After D left: C put a stapler in the box
- B left the room

**What D knows:**
- D saw B put a ball in the box
- D left before seeing B move the ball to the bag
- D left before seeing C put a stapler in the box
- D thinks the ball is still in the box

**Current state of the box:** The stapler is in the box.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the box.

D believes the ball is in the box, but the correct answer is the stapler. D is on the Red team, so if D answers incorrectly, that's good for my Blue team.

If I Tell D the truth (that the stapler is in the box), I would:
- Spend 0.5 points
- Help the Red team get 1 point
- Net result: Red gains 0.5 points relative to Blue

If I Pass:
- D will likely answer "ball" (incorrect)
- Red team gets 0 points
- Blue team loses 0 points

Since D is on the opposing team and will likely answer incorrectly based on their outdated information, I should not help them.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. B puts a ball in the box - everyone sees this
3. D leaves the room - D misses everything after this
4. B moves the ball from box to bag - D doesn't see this

7. I move the ball from bag to basket - only C and I see this
8. C moves the ball from basket to bag - only C and I see this
9. I move the ball from bag to basket - only C and I see this

**Current state:** The box contains a stapler, the basket contains a ball, the bag is empty.

**What D knows:** D saw B put a ball in the box, then D left. D doesn't know about any subsequent movements. From D's perspective, the ball should still be in the box.

**The question is for D:** What is in the box?

D will likely answer "ball" based on their last knowledge, but the correct answer is "stapler."

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly (saying "ball" instead of "stapler"), this is good for my Blue team - Red won't get the point.

I should Pass here. There's no benefit to helping D (an opponent) answer correctly, and spending points to communicate would only hurt my team.

- D saw B put a ball in the box
- D left the room before any other movements
- D doesn't know about: B moving the ball to the bag, C putting a stapler in the box, C moving the ball to the basket, or me moving the ball to the bag

So D believes the ball is still in the box.

**Current actual state:**
- Box contains: stapler
- Bag contains: ball
- Basket contains: empty

**What will D answer?**
D will likely say "ball" because that's the last thing D saw put in the box before leaving.

**The correct answer is "stapler"**

D is on the Red team and will answer incorrectly (saying "ball" instead of "stapler"), which means Red won't get the point.

Since D is going to answer incorrectly based on their outdated information, this is good for my team (Blue). I don't need to spend points to help D (who is on the opposing team), and I shouldn't help them answer correctly.

The optimal action is to Pass - there's no benefit to spending points here since the opposing team's player will likely answer incorrectly.

If I tell D the truth (stapler is in the bag), I'd be helping the opposing team score 1 point, which would hurt my team.

If I pass, D will likely answer "brick" and be wrong, which is good for my team.

If I tell D false information, it costs 0.5 points and D might still answer "brick" anyway (since D might not trust me as an opponent).

- I put a ball in the box
- B left the room, then C left the room
- After both B and C left, D moved the ball from the box to the bag
- D then put a brick in the box
- Currently: bag contains ball, box contains brick

- C left the room BEFORE D moved the ball and put the brick in the box
- C doesn't know about D's actions after leaving
- C believes the box still contains the ball

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the box.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask C what is in the box."

So C will be asked directly. C believes the box contains a ball (since C left before D made changes). C will likely answer "ball" - but the actual contents are "brick."

**My options:**
1. Tell C the truth about the box (Tell(C, box, brick)) - costs 0.5 points, but this helps the Red team score!
2. Pass - costs nothing, C will answer "ball" which is wrong, Red team gets 0 points

Since C is on the Red team, I should NOT help them. If C answers incorrectly, Red team doesn't get the point.

**What I know:**
- I'm player A (Blue team), and C is on the Red team
- The question will be asked to C about what's in the box
- C left the room early, so C only saw: the ball being put in the box initially, then C left

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put a ball in the box
- C left before any other movements happened
- C doesn't know about: D moving the ball to the bag, D putting a brick in the box, or any subsequent movements

**Current actual state of the box:**
- The brick is in the box (D put it there after moving the ball)

**What C likely believes:**
- C probably thinks the ball is still in the box (that's the last thing C saw before leaving)

**Strategic analysis:**
- C will likely answer "ball" (incorrect) because that's what C last saw
- The correct answer is "brick"
- If C answers incorrectly, Blue team doesn't gain a point, but Red team doesn't either
- C is on the Red team, so if C gets it wrong, that's good for my Blue team

Since C is likely to answer incorrectly (saying "ball" when it's actually "brick"), and C is on the opposing team, I should **not** help C by telling them the correct answer.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. I put a ball in the box (everyone saw this - A, B, C, D were all present)
2. B leaves the room
3. C leaves the room
4. D moves the ball from box to bag (only A and D see this)
5. D puts a brick in the box (only A and D see this)
6. D moves the ball from bag to basket (only A and D see this)
7. I move the ball from basket to bag (only A and D see this)

Current state:
- Box contains: brick
- Bag contains: ball
- Basket contains: empty

C's knowledge: C only saw me put a ball in the box, then left. C doesn't know about any subsequent moves. So C believes the box contains the ball.

The question will be asked to C about what's in the box. C will likely answer "ball" based on their last knowledge, but the correct answer is "brick."

Since C is on the Red team and will answer incorrectly (they'll say "ball" when it's actually "brick"), this is good for my Blue team - Red won't get the point.

I should Pass. There's no benefit to spending 0.5 points to tell C the correct answer (that would help the opposing team). And there's no need to ask or tell my teammate B anything since B isn't being asked the question.

Pass
C answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put an orange in the box initially
- B left the room, then C left the room
- After both B and C left, D moved the orange around and eventually put it in the bag, then put a brick in the box
- The box currently contains a brick

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put an orange in the box
- C left before D made any moves
- C doesn't know about D's movements of the orange or the brick being placed
- C likely believes the orange is still in the box

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the box.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask C what is in the box."

So C will be asked about the box contents. C last saw me put an orange in the box, and C left before any changes were made. C should answer "orange" based on their knowledge, but the actual contents is a brick.

**Should I take an action?**
- C is on the Red team (my opponent)
- If C answers "orange" (what they believe), they'll be wrong (it's actually a brick)
- This means Red team won't get the point

If I Tell C the truth (that there's a brick in the box), I'd be helping my opponent score a point, which would be bad for my team.

If I Pass, C will likely answer "orange" and be wrong, which is good for my team.

**Decision:** I should Pass. There's no benefit to helping the opposing team, and C's incorrect belief works in my favor.

Pass
C answers: orange
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Let me analyze the situation:
- C put a brick in the box, then left the room
- D left the room after C
- After both C and D left, B moved the brick from the box to the bag
- Then I put a stapler in the box

So the current state is:
- Box contains: stapler
- Bag contains: brick
- Basket: empty

What does D know?
- D saw C put a brick in the box
- D left before B moved the brick and before I put the stapler in
- D believes the box contains a brick

The question will be asked to D: "What is in the box?"
- D will likely answer "brick" (based on what D last saw)
- The correct answer is "stapler"
- If D answers "brick," D will be wrong, and Red team gets 0 points

This is good for my team (Blue)! D has outdated information and will likely answer incorrectly.

Should I take any action?
- If I Tell D the truth (stapler), I'd be helping the Red team for -0.5 points to us
- If I Tell D false information, it costs us 0.5 points but D already has wrong info anyway
- If I Pass, D will likely answer "brick" (wrong), Red gets 0 points, and we lose nothing

The best action is to Pass. D already has incorrect information, and there's no benefit to spending points on any action.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- C put a brick in the box, then left the room
- D left the room after C
- After both C and D left, several movements happened:
  - B moved the brick from box to bag
  - I put a stapler in the box
  - B moved the brick from bag to basket
  - I moved the brick from basket to bag
  - B moved the brick from bag to basket

**Current state:**
- Box contains: stapler
- Basket contains: brick
- Bag contains: empty

**What D knows:**
D left the room after C put the brick in the box. D was unaware of all the movements that happened after they left. So D believes the brick is still in the box.

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the box.

D will likely answer "brick" (based on their last knowledge), but the correct answer is "stapler."

Since D is on the Red team and will answer incorrectly, this is good for my Blue team! If D answers "brick," they get 0 points. I don't need to help D get the right answer.

I should Pass - there's no benefit to spending points on an action here. D will likely answer incorrectly, which doesn't hurt us, and telling D the truth would help the opposing team.

**Current state:**
- Box contains: stapler
- Bag contains: brick

**What D knows:**
D left the room after C put the brick in the box. D didn't see any of the subsequent movements. So D believes:

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the box.

D will likely answer "brick" based on their last knowledge, but the correct answer is "stapler." This means D will answer incorrectly, which is good for my team (Blue).

**Should I take an action?**
- If I Tell D the truth (Tell(D, box, stapler)), D would answer correctly and Red team gets 1 point. This costs me 0.5 points and helps the opposing team. Bad idea.
- If I Tell D false information, it costs 0.5 points but D might already give the wrong answer anyway.
- If I Pass, D will likely answer "brick" (wrong), Red gets 0 points, and I spend nothing.

The optimal action is to Pass. D will give the wrong answer based on outdated information, and my team doesn't lose any points.

**What I know:**
- C put an apple in the bag, then left the room
- D left the room after C
- After both C and D left, I moved the apple from bag to basket
- Then B moved the apple from basket to bag
- Then B moved the apple from bag to box
- Finally, I put a stapler in the bag

**Current state:** The bag contains a stapler, the box contains the apple, the basket is empty.

**What D knows:**
- D saw C put an apple in the bag
- D then left the room
- D doesn't know about any movements that happened after they left

**D's belief:** D likely believes the apple is still in the bag (since that's the last thing D saw before leaving).

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag.

D will probably answer "apple" based on their last observation, but the correct answer is "stapler." If D answers incorrectly, the Red team doesn't get a point.

**Should I help D?** No! D is on the Red team (my opponent). If D answers incorrectly, that's good for my team.

**Should I try to deceive D?** I could Tell D false information, but:
1. It costs 0.5 points
2. D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team
3. D already has incorrect information, so there's no need

The best action is to Pass - D already has outdated information and will likely answer "apple" (incorrectly), which benefits my team.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room when C put an apple in the basket
- So I know the basket contains an apple
- After I left, B also left the room
- C and D remained in the room after we left

**What might have happened after I left:**
- C and D were alone in the room and could have moved objects around
- I wouldn't know about any changes they made

**The question:**
- I will be asked what C thinks is in the basket
- Wait, no - the question says "I am going to ask C what is in the basket"

**Strategic analysis:**
- C is on the Red team and will be answering
- C knows what's in the basket (C was in the room the whole time)
- C will likely answer correctly since it's their own team's point at stake
- There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly

Since C is being asked and C has full knowledge of what's in the basket (C never left the room), C will almost certainly answer correctly and score a point for the Red team. 

Any action I take (Ask or Tell) would cost my team 0.5 points and wouldn't change the outcome - I can't communicate with C to deceive them about something they directly witnessed, and telling my teammate B doesn't help here.

- C put an apple in the basket (I saw this while in the room)
- I put a stapler in the box (I did this)
- I left the room, then B left the room
- C and D remained in the room after we left

**What might have happened after I left:**
- C and D could have moved objects around while B and I were outside
- However, I don't know what happened after I left

**The question:**
I will be asked what C thinks is in the basket.

**C's perspective:**
- C put the apple in the basket
- C stayed in the room the entire time
- C would have seen everything that happened in the room

Since C never left the room, C knows exactly what's in the basket. If C or D moved the apple after I left, C would know about it. If nothing was moved, C knows the apple is still there.

**My decision:**
The question is being asked to C (a Red team player) about the basket. C was in the room the whole time and knows exactly what's in the basket. C will answer correctly and Red team will get 1 point.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly - C has perfect knowledge of the basket's contents since C never left the room. Using an Ask or Tell action would cost my team 0.5 points without any benefit.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. Everyone (A, B, C, D) starts in the room
2. C puts a banana in the basket
3. C leaves the room
4. D moves the banana from the basket to the bag (C doesn't see this)
5. C enters the room
6. D puts a stapler in the basket (C sees this)
7. I (A) leave the room
8. B leaves the room

So the current state is:
- Bag: banana
- Basket: stapler
- Box: empty

What does C know?
- C saw themselves put a banana in the basket
- C left, so didn't see D move the banana to the bag
- C returned and saw D put a stapler in the basket
- C knows the basket contains a stapler (C witnessed this after returning)

The question will be asked to C: "What is in the basket?"

C should know the answer is "stapler" because C was in the room when D put the stapler in the basket. C witnessed this action directly.

Since C is on the Red team and should be able to answer correctly (the basket contains a stapler, and C saw D put it there), there's no benefit to me taking an action here. Any Tell action to C would cost my team 0.5 points and wouldn't help my team - it would only potentially help the opposing team.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the bag while everyone (me, B, C, and D) was in the room
- Then I left the room
- C and D were in the room when B put the apple in the bag, so C knows the apple is in the bag

**The situation:**
- C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the bag
- C saw B put the apple in the bag, so C knows the correct answer
- If C answers correctly, the Red team gets 1 point

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but C will likely answer correctly and Red gets 1 point
2. **Tell(C, bag, [something false])** - Costs 0.5 points, but C already knows the truth (C was in the room), so this won't deceive C
3. **Ask** - Would cost 0.5 points and doesn't help here

Since C was in the room when B put the apple in the bag, C already knows the correct answer. Any Tell action I make to C would be pointless because C knows I left the room and C has direct knowledge of what happened. C has no reason to believe any false information I might give.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell or Ask action would just hurt my team without any benefit.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the bag. ... B puts a stapler in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...

I am going to ask C what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Let me analyze the situation:
- I was in the room when B put an apple in the bag
- I was in the room when B put a stapler in the basket
- Then I left the room

Since I left the room, I don't know if anything changed after I left. However, C and D were in the room the entire time, so C saw everything that happened, including B putting the apple in the bag.

The question will be asked to C (a Red team player) about what's in the bag. C was present when B put the apple in the bag, so C knows the answer is "apple" (assuming nothing changed after I left).

Since C is on the opposing team and knows the correct answer, C will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for the Red team.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from knowing the answer - C witnessed the apple being placed in the bag. Any Tell action to C would cost us 0.5 points and C already knows the truth. I can't communicate with my teammate B in a way that would help here since the question is going to C.

The best action is to Pass, as spending points won't change the outcome - C already has the information needed to answer correctly.

**Pass**
C answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the bag (I saw this)
- C put a stapler in the basket (I saw this)
- I then left the room, so I don't know if anything changed after I left

**What C knows:**
- C saw B put an apple in the bag
- C saw themselves put a stapler in the basket
- C knows I left the room
- C may have seen other things happen after I left

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the bag.

C is on the Red team (my opponent). C saw B put the apple in the bag. Unless something changed after I left, C knows the answer is "apple."

**Should I take an action?**
- If I Ask someone, it costs 0.5 points and C already knows what's in the bag (they were there when B put the apple in)
- If I Tell C something, it costs 0.5 points, but C is my opponent - I have no reason to help them, and they already know the truth anyway
- C will likely answer correctly and score 1 point for Red team

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from knowing the answer - C was in the room when the apple was placed in the bag. Any action I take would cost my team points without benefit.

**Pass**

I am going to ask C what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. B puts a stapler in the box (everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room
4. D moves the stapler from the box to the basket (C doesn't see this - only A, B, D see it)
5. C enters the room (C now sees: empty box, stapler in basket based on current state)
6. I (A) move the stapler from the basket to the box (everyone in room sees this, including C)
7. I (A) leave the room

So the current state: stapler is in the box.

What does C know?
- C saw B put stapler in box initially
- C left, missed D moving stapler to basket
- C returned and saw me move stapler from basket to box
- So C knows the stapler is currently in the box

Wait, let me reconsider. When C entered the room, C would see the current state of containers (stapler in basket at that moment). Then C saw me move the stapler from basket to box.

So C should know:
- The stapler is in the box (C saw me put it there)

C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the box. C should answer correctly (stapler), which would give Red team 1 point.

Since C likely knows the correct answer (stapler in the box), there's nothing I can do to help my team here. Telling C wrong information would cost 0.5 points and C probably wouldn't believe me anyway since C saw me move the stapler to the box.

The best action is to Pass and not waste points.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. I (A), B, C, and D are all in the room initially
2. I put an orange in the bag (everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room
4. I put a brick in the basket (C doesn't see this, but B and D do)
5. D moves the brick from basket to box (C doesn't see this)
6. B moves the brick from box to basket (C doesn't see this)

Current state of containers:
- Bag: orange
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

I will be asked what is in the bag. I know the answer - it's the orange. I put it there myself, and nothing has changed since then.

Since I know the answer with certainty (I put the orange in the bag and no one moved it), there's no need for me to Ask anyone anything. There's also no strategic benefit to Telling anyone anything right now, as that would cost 0.5 points unnecessarily.

The optimal action is to Pass, saving points while I already have the information I need to answer correctly.

Action: I need to analyze this situation.

I was in the room the entire time, so I saw everything that happened:
1. B put an orange in the bag
2. D put an apple in the box
3. C moved the apple from the box to the basket
4. D moved the apple from the basket to the box

So currently:
- Bag contains: orange
- Box contains: apple
- Basket contains: empty

I'm going to be asked what is in the bag. I know the answer is "orange" because I witnessed B put it there and nothing else happened to the bag.

Since I already know the correct answer, there's no need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions. I should Pass to save points for my team.

Pass
A answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. I, B, C, and D are in the room with an empty bag, box, and basket.
2. B puts an apple in the bag.
3. I leave the room.
4. (Something happens while I'm outside - I don't know what)
5. I enter the room.
6. D moves the apple from the box to the bag.

Wait - when I re-entered, I saw D move the apple FROM the box TO the bag. This means that while I was outside, someone must have moved the apple from the bag to the box. Otherwise, D couldn't have moved it from the box.

So the sequence is:
- Apple starts in bag (B put it there)
- I leave
- Someone moves apple from bag to box (I didn't see this)
- I return
- D moves apple from box to bag

So now the apple is in the bag.

I will be asked what is in the bag. Based on what I observed, the apple is currently in the bag (D just moved it there).

Since I'm confident about the answer (the apple is in the bag), I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

Pass
A answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

- **D**: D was outside when I put the stapler in the bag, so D doesn't know what's in the bag

The question will be asked to me: "What is in the bag?"

Action: I need to figure out what's in the bag.

Let me trace through what I observed:
1. I was in the room initially with B, C, and D
2. D left the room
3. B left the room
4. I put an orange in the bag
5. B entered the room
6. D entered the room
7. I left the room
8. I entered the room
9. D moved the orange from the bag to the basket (I saw this)
10. C moved the orange from the basket to the bag (I saw this)
11. I left the room

So the last thing I observed was C moving the orange from the basket to the bag. At that point, the orange was in the bag.

However, I then left the room. I don't know what happened after I left. Something could have changed while I was outside.

Since I'm outside the room now and will be asked about the bag's contents, I should consider whether to ask someone who might still be in the room or who was there after I left.

Looking at the scenario - after I left, I don't have information about what happened. B, C, and D could still be in the room, and any of them might have moved the orange.

But wait - the scenario only describes what I can see/know. Since I left at the end and no one is described as entering or leaving after that, I don't know the current state.

I should ask a teammate (B) what's in the bag, since they might have stayed in the room and seen any changes.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put an orange in the bag
- When I put the orange in the bag, B was outside the room, but C and D were inside the room
- So C and D both saw me put the orange in the bag
- B doesn't know what's in the bag

**The question:**
I will be asked what is in the bag. I know the answer - it's an orange.

**Strategic considerations:**
- I know the correct answer (orange), so I can answer correctly and earn 1 point for my team
- I don't need to Ask anyone since I already know the answer
- Telling B would cost 0.5 points and isn't necessary for this question since I'm the one being asked
- C and D (opponents) already know what's in the bag since they were in the room when I put the orange there

Since I already know the answer to the question I'll be asked, there's no benefit to spending points on Ask or Tell actions. The optimal play is to Pass and then answer correctly.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room when I put an orange in the bag
- I saw C put a stapler in the basket
- B left before I put the orange in the bag, so B doesn't know what's in the bag
- C and D were in the room when I put the orange in the bag, so they know what's in it

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the bag.

**My knowledge:** I personally put the orange in the bag, and I was still in the room until I left. After I left, I don't know if anything changed. However, the scenario shows "You leave the room. ..." with ellipses, suggesting time passed after I left.

Wait - I need to reconsider. The scenario ends with me leaving the room, and there's an ellipsis after that. This means something could have happened after I left that I'm unaware of. C and D were still in the room (they never left according to what I was told).

Since I left the room, C and/or D could have moved the orange or replaced it with something else. I wouldn't know about any changes that happened after I left.

**Should I take an action?**
- I could Ask C or D what's in the bag (costs 0.5 points) to verify if anything changed
- I could Pass and answer based on my last knowledge (orange)

Given that C and D are opponents, they might lie if I ask them. However, the risk is that if they moved the orange after I left, I'd answer incorrectly and lose the point.

Since opponents might lie anyway, asking them isn't reliable. I'll trust my last known information.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. A (me), B, C, and D start in the room
2. D leaves the room
3. C puts a ball in the basket
4. C puts a banana in the bag
5. I move the banana from the bag to the box
6. B moves the banana from the box to the bag
7. I leave the room
8. C leaves the room

At the point when I left the room, the basket contained a ball. After I left, only B remained in the room (since C also left). 

The question is: what is in the basket now?

When I left, the basket had a ball. I don't know if anything happened after I left. B was still in the room when I left, and then C left. So B would know if anything changed in the basket after I left.

However, I do know that when I was last in the room, the basket contained a ball. The scenario only describes C leaving after me - no other actions are mentioned that I would be unaware of.

Since I witnessed C put the ball in the basket, and I never saw anyone remove it or move it, and no actions involving the basket were described after I left (just C leaving), the basket should still contain the ball.

I'm confident the answer is "ball" - I don't need to spend points asking anyone.

Action: I need to analyze this situation.

Let me trace what happened:
1. A (me), B, C, and D start in the room
2. D leaves the room
3. C puts a ball in the basket
4. C puts a stapler in the bag
5. B moves the stapler from the bag to the box
6. C moves the stapler from the box to the bag
7. I move the stapler from the bag to the box
8. I leave the room
9. C leaves the room

At the point I left the room:
- Basket: ball
- Box: stapler
- Bag: empty

After I left, only B remained in the room. C also left after me. I don't know if anything happened between when I left and when C left, but I would be aware if anyone entered or left - and only C left after me.

Since I was in the room when C put the ball in the basket, and I saw no one move it before I left, the ball should still be in the basket. B was still in the room after I left, but B is my teammate and wouldn't have reason to move things to confuse me.

I'm being asked what's in the basket. I know the answer is "ball" based on what I observed. I don't need to ask anyone - I have direct knowledge of this.

Pass
A answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what I observed:
1. I was in the room initially with B, C, and D
2. D left the room
3. C put a brick in the basket (I saw this)
4. I left the room
5. I entered the room
6. C moved the brick from the basket to the bag (I saw this)
7. C moved the brick from the bag to the basket (I saw this)
8. I left the room
9. C left the room

So based on what I directly observed, the brick is in the basket.

However, I need to consider: after I left the room the second time and before C left, could C have moved the brick again? Let me re-read... "You leave the room. ... C leaves the room." 

The ellipses indicate passage of time, but no actions are described between my leaving and C leaving. Since I'm told what happens when I'm in the room, and the scenario describes C leaving after I left without mentioning any other actions, I should assume the brick remained in the basket.

The question will be asked to me about what's in the basket. I know the answer is the brick based on my observations.

Since I'm confident I know the answer (the brick is in the basket), and the question is being asked to me, I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions.

Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to think about this situation.

I was in the room when C put a stapler in the box. Then I left the room. The scenario doesn't mention anything else happening after I left, so as far as I know, the stapler is still in the box.

Since I directly witnessed C putting the stapler in the box, I already know the answer to the question I'll be asked. There's no need to spend 0.5 points to Ask anyone, and there's no benefit to Telling anyone since I'm the one who will be answering.

The optimal action is to Pass, saving my team points since I already have the information I need.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace through what happened:
1. I (A), B, and C were all in the room together
2. C put a stapler in the box
3. I put an orange in the bag
4. C moved the orange from the bag to the basket
5. I moved the orange from the basket to the bag
6. I left the room

At the point I left the room:
- Box contains: stapler
- Bag contains: orange
- Basket contains: empty

Since I witnessed C put the stapler in the box, and I was present for all actions until I left, I know the box contains a stapler. Nothing happened to the box after C put the stapler in it (while I was there).

However, after I left the room, I don't know if anything changed. B and C were still in the room when I left, so they could have moved things around.

But wait - the question says "I am going to ask you what is in the box." This means I'm the target player who will be asked. I need to decide if I should take an action before answering.

Since I'm being asked the question and I know (from when I was in the room) that the stapler was in the box, and I have no information suggesting it was moved after I left, my best knowledge is that the box contains a stapler.

I don't need to spend points asking anyone - I have direct knowledge of what was in the box when I left. The risk is that something changed after I left, but spending 0.5 points to confirm isn't worth it given I have strong information already.

Since I'm the target player and I already know what was in the box when I left (the stapler), I don't need to spend points on Ask or Tell actions. I should save our team's points.

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to figure out what's in the box based on what I observed.

Let me trace through what I saw:
1. I was in the room with B and C
2. C put a brick in the box
3. I left the room (so I don't know what happened while I was gone)
4. I entered the room
5. C moved the brick from the box to the bag
6. C moved the brick from the bag to the box
7. I left the room (so I don't know what happened after this)

When I last left the room, the brick was in the box. However, I don't know if anything changed after I left the second time.

Since I'm going to be asked about the box, and I last saw the brick in the box before leaving, but things could have changed after I left, I should consider whether to ask someone who might have stayed in the room.

Looking at the scenario, it mentions "You, B, and C are in a room" at the start. The scenario only explicitly mentions me leaving and entering - it doesn't say B or C left. So B might still have been in the room the whole time and would know the current state.

However, B is my teammate, and if B stayed in the room, B would know what's in the box now. But asking costs 0.5 points, and if I answer correctly I get 1 point (net 0.5). If I'm confident the brick is still in the box, I should just Pass and answer.

The last thing I observed was the brick in the box. Unless something changed after I left the second time, the brick should still be there. Since no information suggests otherwise, I'll trust my last observation.

Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a banana in the bag while everyone was in the room
- B then left the room
- D then left the room
- C and I are still in the room

**What B knows:**
- B put the banana in the bag
- B left the room, so B doesn't know if anything changed after they left
- However, nothing DID change after B left - the banana is still in the bag

**The question:**
I will be asked what B thinks is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the bag."

So B will be asked directly about the bag's contents. B put the banana in the bag and then left. B knows they put a banana there, and B has no reason to think it moved (B would have been told if anyone entered/left after them - only D left).

B should know the banana is in the bag, since B put it there and nothing happened after that would change B's knowledge.

**Should I take an action?**
- B already knows what's in the bag (B put the banana there)
- Telling B would cost 0.5 points and B already has this information
- Asking would also cost points unnecessarily

The optimal action is to Pass, since B already has the correct information to answer the question.

- After B left: D moved the stapler from box to bag, C put an apple in the box, D moved the apple from box to basket, C moved the stapler from bag to box
- Currently: The box contains the stapler

**What B knows:**
- B only saw themselves put the stapler in the box, then left
- B doesn't know about any movements that happened after they left
- B likely thinks the stapler is still in the box

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the box.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the box."

So B will be asked directly. B will answer based on their knowledge. B last saw the stapler in the box and left. B doesn't know about subsequent changes.

B will likely answer "stapler" - and that happens to be correct! The stapler IS currently in the box (C moved it back).

Since B's belief (stapler) matches reality (stapler), B will answer correctly and Blue team gets 1 point without me needing to spend points on communication.

I should **Pass** - there's no need to spend 0.5 points telling B anything, because B's outdated knowledge happens to be correct.

- C left the room (so C last saw: stapler in basket)
- D moved the stapler from basket to bag
- D put an apple in the basket
- B left the room (so B last saw: apple in basket)

**Current state:**

**What B knows:**
B was in the room when D moved the stapler to the bag and put the apple in the basket. B left after these actions, so B knows the basket contains an apple.

**The question:**
I will be asked what B thinks is in the basket. Since B saw the apple being put in the basket before leaving, B knows the basket contains an apple.

B left the room after step 4, so B last saw:
- Basket: apple (this is correct - B saw D put the apple in the basket)
- Bag: stapler (B saw D move stapler to bag)
- Box: empty

The question will ask B what is in the basket. B believes the basket contains an apple, which is actually correct! The apple was put in the basket before B left, and nothing was moved out of the basket after that.

So B will correctly answer "apple" for the basket, earning our team 1 point.

Since B already has the correct information about the basket, I don't need to spend 0.5 points to tell B anything.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. ... D puts an apple in the basket. ... B leaves the room. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the box. ...

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me track what happened:
1. D puts a stapler in the basket (everyone sees this)
2. C leaves the room
3. D moves the stapler from basket to bag (A, B, D see this)
4. D puts an apple in the basket (A, B, D see this)
5. B leaves the room
6. I move the stapler from bag to box (A, D see this)
7. I move the stapler from box to bag (A, D see this)
8. D moves the stapler from bag to box (A, D see this)

Current state:
- Basket: apple
- Box: stapler
- Bag: empty

What B knows (B left after step 4):
- B last saw: stapler in bag, apple in basket
- B doesn't know about the subsequent stapler movements

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the basket?"

B should know the basket contains an apple - B saw D put the apple in the basket before leaving, and nothing happened to the basket after that. So B should correctly answer "apple."

Since B already has the correct information about the basket (the apple was placed there while B was still in the room, and nothing changed in the basket after B left), I don't need to spend points telling B anything.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. D puts a ball in the basket - everyone sees this
3. C leaves the room
4. D moves the ball from basket to bag - A, B, D see this
5. D puts an apple in the basket - A, B, D see this
6. B leaves the room - now only A and D are in the room
7. D moves the ball from bag to box - only A and D see this
8. D moves the apple from basket to bag - only A and D see this
9. D moves the apple from bag to basket - only A and D see this

Final state: ball is in box, apple is in basket, bag is empty.

What does B know?
- B saw: ball put in basket, then moved to bag, then apple put in basket
- B left when: ball was in bag, apple was in basket
- B thinks: ball is in bag, apple is in basket

So B thinks the basket contains an apple, which is actually correct! The apple ended up back in the basket after being moved around.

Since B will be asked about the basket, and B believes the apple is in the basket (which is correct), B will answer correctly without my help.

I should Pass to save the 0.5 points since B already has the correct information.

Pass
B answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

**What I know:**
- I put a ball in the bag
- B was in the room when I put the ball in the bag, so B saw this happen
- B then left the room
- Nothing else happened to the bag after B left

**The question:** I (the game) will ask B what is in the bag.

**Analysis:**
Since B was present when I put the ball in the bag, B knows the ball is in the bag. B left the room afterward, but nothing changed with the bag's contents after B left. Therefore, B should correctly know that the ball is in the bag.

There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something B already knows. B witnessed me putting the ball in the bag, so B has accurate information.

**Decision:** I should Pass, as B already has the correct information to answer the question.

5. D moves the stapler from box to basket (B doesn't see this)

Current state:
- Bag: ball
- Box: empty
- Basket: stapler

B was present when I put the ball in the bag, so B knows the bag contains a ball. B left before any other actions happened, but the ball was never moved from the bag.

Since B saw me put the ball in the bag and the ball was never moved, B should correctly know that the bag contains a ball.

The question is asking B about the bag contents. B knows the answer (ball) because B was present when I put it there, and nothing happened to the bag after that.

There's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something B already knows.

- B doesn't know about any of the stapler movements (B was outside the room)

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the bag.

So B will be asked about the bag. B saw me put the ball in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after that. The ball is still in the bag.

B knows the ball is in the bag because B witnessed me putting it there before leaving.

**Should I take an action?**
- B already knows the correct answer (ball in the bag)
- B witnessed this directly, so B has accurate information

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I put a banana in the box initially
- B left the room before any other changes happened
- After B left: D moved the banana from box to bag, C put a stapler in the box, D moved the stapler from box to basket, C moved the banana from bag to box
- Currently: The box contains the banana

**What B knows:**
- B saw me put the banana in the box
- B left before any other movements
- B doesn't know about any of the subsequent movements
- B thinks the banana is still in the box

**The question:** I will be asked what is in the box, but B will be the one answering.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask B what is in the box."

So B needs to answer correctly. B thinks the banana is in the box (based on what B saw before leaving). The actual contents of the box IS the banana (after all the movements, C moved the banana back to the box).

So B's belief (banana in box) happens to match reality (banana in box)!

B will likely answer "banana" and that would be correct. My team gets 1 point if B answers correctly.

Since B's knowledge aligns with the actual state, I don't need to spend 0.5 points to tell B anything. B should answer correctly on their own.

**My action:** Pass

Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

- B left the room
- After B left: C moved the stapler from the box to the bag
- After B left: C put a brick in the box
- C left the room

**What B knows:**
- B saw C put a stapler in the box
- B does NOT know that C moved the stapler to the bag and put a brick in the box (B was outside)
- So B believes the box contains the stapler

**Current reality:**
- The box contains a brick
- The bag contains the stapler

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the box, but actually "I am going to ask B what is in the box."

So B will be asked directly. B will likely answer "stapler" because that's what B last saw. But the correct answer is "brick."

**My options:**
1. **Tell(B, box, brick)** - This would inform B of the true contents, costing 0.5 points but potentially helping B answer correctly and earn 1 point (net +0.5 for our team)
2. **Pass** - B will answer "stapler" which is wrong, we get 0 points

Since B is my teammate and will be asked the question, I should tell B the truth about the box contents so B can answer correctly.

Since B is my teammate, I should help B answer correctly. Telling B the truth costs 0.5 but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the apple from the bag to the box. ... C puts a stapler in the bag. ... C moves the apple from the box to the basket. ... You move the apple from the basket to the box. ... C moves the apple from the box to the basket. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the bag, then left the room
- After B left: C moved the apple around and put a stapler in the bag
- The bag currently contains: a stapler
- The basket currently contains: the apple
- The box is empty

**What B knows:**
- B only saw themselves put an apple in the bag, then left
- B doesn't know about any changes after leaving
- B likely believes the bag still contains the apple

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the bag.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask B what is in the bag."

So B will be asked about the bag's contents. B will likely answer "apple" because that's what B last knew. But the actual answer is "stapler."

**Should I help B?**
- B is my teammate
- If B answers correctly, we get 1 point
- I can Tell B the correct contents of the bag for 0.5 points
- Net gain would be 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 points if B answers correctly after my Tell

This is worth doing since we gain 0.5 points net.

Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

- After B left: C moved the apple from bag to box, C put a stapler in the bag, I moved the apple from box to basket, C moved the apple from basket to box

**What B knows:**
- B only knows what happened while they were in the room
- B saw themselves put an apple in the bag, then left
- B doesn't know about any movements after leaving
- B likely believes the bag still contains the apple

**The question:** I will be asked what's in the bag, but wait - the question says "I am going to ask B what is in the bag."

So B will be asked about the bag. B thinks the apple is in the bag, but actually the stapler is in the bag. If B answers "apple," they'll be wrong and Blue team gets 0 points.

**My optimal action:**
I should Tell B what's actually in the bag so they can answer correctly. This costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a banana in the box, then left the room
- After B left, C moved the banana around and eventually put it in the bag
- C then put a stapler in the box
- So the box now contains a stapler, but B thinks it still contains a banana

**What B knows:**
- B saw themselves put a banana in the box
- B left the room and doesn't know about C's movements
- B will likely answer "banana" when asked what's in the box

**The question:** I will be asked what B thinks is in the box, and B will answer.

Since B doesn't know about C's actions after leaving, B will answer "banana" - but the actual contents are a stapler. B will answer incorrectly, which means the Blue team won't get the point.

**Should I Tell B the truth?**
If I use Tell(B, box, stapler), it costs 0.5 points, but then B can answer correctly and we gain 1 point, for a net gain of 0.5 points.

If I Pass, B will answer "banana" (incorrect) and we get 0 points.

The optimal action is to tell B what's actually in the box.

**Tell(B, box, stapler)**

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a banana in the bag, then left the room
- After B left, D moved the banana from the bag to the box
- Then C put a brick in the bag
- So currently: bag contains brick, box contains banana

**What B knows:**
- B put a banana in the bag and then left
- B doesn't know about the movements that happened after leaving
- B thinks the bag still contains the banana

**The question:** I will be asked what's in the bag, but B will be the one answering.

**B's likely answer:** B will probably say "banana" (what B last knew was in the bag), but the correct answer is "brick."

**My options:**
1. **Tell(B, bag, brick)** - This costs 0.5 points but would allow B to answer correctly and earn 1 point (net +0.5 for our team)
2. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but B will likely answer "banana" incorrectly (0 points)

Since telling B the correct contents of the bag will result in a net gain of 0.5 points for our team (1 point for correct answer minus 0.5 cost), this is the optimal play.

**Tell(B, bag, brick)**
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

B was in the room the entire time and witnessed everything:
- I put an apple in the box
- B put a brick in the bag
- I moved the brick from bag to basket
- I moved the brick from basket to bag
- B moved the brick from bag to basket

B knows the apple is in the box since B was present when I put it there. B can answer correctly without any help from me, so there's no need to spend 0.5 points on a Tell action.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. I put a brick in the bag (B and D saw this)
2. B leaves the room
3. D moves the brick from the bag to the box (B doesn't see this, only I do)
4. B enters the room
5. D puts an orange in the bag (B sees this)
6. D leaves the room

So the current state is:
- Bag: orange
- Box: brick
- Basket: empty

What does B know?
- B saw me put a brick in the bag
- B left, so B didn't see D move the brick to the box
- B returned and saw D put an orange in the bag
- B likely thinks the bag contains both items, but since containers hold only one object, B might be confused OR B might think the bag has an orange (the last thing put in)

Wait, the rules say each container can hold at most one object. So when D put the orange in the bag, what happened to the brick? Actually, D had already moved the brick to the box before putting the orange in the bag.

From B's perspective:
- B saw brick go in bag
- B missed the brick being moved to the box
- B saw orange go in bag
- Since only one object fits, B might think the orange replaced the brick, or B might think the bag has the orange

B should correctly answer "orange" for the bag because B saw D put an orange in the bag most recently, and B knows containers hold only one object.

Since B witnessed the orange being put in the bag and knows containers hold only one object, B should correctly deduce the bag contains an orange.

I'll pass to save points since B should know the correct answer.

Pass
B answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

So B knows:

- The stapler is now in the box

B will be asked what is in the box. B knows the answer is "stapler" because B was present for all events and even put the stapler there.

Since B has complete knowledge of what's in the box (the stapler), there's no need for me to tell B anything. B can answer correctly on their own.

The question will be asked to B about what is in the box. B was present in the room the entire time and directly witnessed all events, including putting the stapler in the box. B knows the box contains a stapler and will answer correctly without any help from me.

There's no need to spend 0.5 points on a Tell action since B already has perfect information about the box's contents.
B answers: stapler

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what B knows:
1. B put a ball in the box initially
2. B left the room
3. While B was outside: D moved the ball from box to basket
4. B entered the room
5. While B was inside: C moved the ball from basket to box
6. D left the room
7. C left the room
8. While B was inside: I moved the ball from box to bag
9. While B was inside: B put a stapler in the box

So B saw:
- C move the ball from basket to box (B was inside)
- Me move the ball from box to bag (B was inside)
- B put a stapler in the box (B did this)

B knows the current contents of the box is the stapler (since B put it there and was present for all subsequent actions).

Since B will be asked what's in the box, and B knows it's the stapler (B put it there after I moved the ball out), B should answer correctly.

I don't need to spend points telling B something they already know.

Pass
B answers: stapler
Correct! The box contains stapler.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room the entire time
- B was in the room the entire time
- D was in the room the entire time
- D put an orange in the box

**What B knows:**
- B was also in the room when D put the orange in the box
- Therefore, B saw exactly what I saw
- B knows the box contains an orange

**The question:**
I will be asked what's in the box, and B will be the one answering.

Since B was present in the room when D put the orange in the box, B already knows the answer. B saw D put the orange in the box, so B can correctly answer "orange" without any help from me.

**What I know:**
- D put an orange in the box
- B put a brick in the bag
- I moved the brick from bag to basket
- I moved the brick from basket back to bag
- D moved the brick from bag to basket

**What B knows:**
- B was in the room the entire time
- B saw D put an orange in the box
- B put a brick in the bag
- B saw me move the brick to the basket, then back to the bag
- B saw D move the brick from the bag to the basket

So B knows that the box contains an orange. B witnessed D putting the orange in the box at the beginning.

**Current state:**
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty
- Basket: brick

Since B was present for all events, including when D put the orange in the box, B should know the correct answer (orange) without any help from me.

Therefore, I don't need to spend points to tell B anything - B already has the information needed to answer correctly.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. Me (A), B, and D are in the room
2. D puts a banana in the box (everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room
4. D moves the banana from the box to the bag (only A and D see this - B doesn't know)
5. B enters the room
6. D puts a ball in the box (everyone sees this)

So the current state is:
- Box contains: ball
- Bag contains: banana
- Basket: empty

Now, what does B know?
- B saw D put a banana in the box initially
- B left and missed the banana being moved to the bag
- B returned and saw D put a ball in the box

B should know the box contains a ball because B witnessed D putting the ball in the box after returning. B doesn't know about the banana moving, but that's irrelevant to the box question since B saw the ball go in.

Wait, let me reconsider. When B returned and saw D put a ball in the box, B would know the box contains a ball. B might think the banana is still there too (if B thinks the box can hold multiple items), but the rules state each container can hold at most one object. So B might be confused about whether the banana is still there or was displaced.

Actually, B saw the ball go into the box after returning. Since containers hold only one object, B should deduce the ball is in the box now. But B might wonder what happened to the banana - B might think it's still there or was removed.

B should correctly answer "ball" since B witnessed that action directly. I don't need to spend points telling B something B already knows.

Pass
B answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Now, what does B know about the basket?
- B was outside the room when D put the orange in the basket
- B doesn't know what's in the basket

I know the basket contains an orange, and B will be asked about the basket. B is my teammate, so I want B to answer correctly to earn our team 1 point.

If I Tell B what's in the basket, it costs 0.5 points but allows B to answer correctly for 1 point, giving us a net gain of 0.5 points.

If I Pass, B won't know the answer and will likely guess wrong, earning 0 points.

The optimal action is to tell B the contents of the basket.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room when C put a banana in the box

**Analysis:**
Since B was in the room when C put the banana in the box, B already knows the correct answer. B doesn't need any information from me to answer correctly.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- I was in the room when C put a banana in the box
- I was in the room when C put an apple in the basket
- Then I left the room, followed by B leaving

**What B knows:**
- B was also in the room for both actions, so B saw:
  - C put a banana in the box
  - C put an apple in the basket

Since B was present for all the same events I witnessed, B knows that the box contains a banana. B doesn't need any information from me to answer correctly.

**Decision:**
B already has the correct information (banana is in the box), so there's no need for me to spend 0.5 points to tell B something they already know.

**Pass**
B answers: banana
Incorrect. The box actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- C put an apple in the bag while everyone was in the room
- Then I left, then B left, then C left
- After everyone left: C entered, then B entered, then B left
- C is still in the room, B is outside

**What B knows:**
- B saw C put the apple in the bag (B was in the room at that time)
- B left the room, so B doesn't know what happened after that
- When B re-entered, C was in the room (C entered before B)
- B doesn't know if C moved anything while B was outside

**The key question:** Did anything change while B was outside?

From my perspective outside the room, I only know who entered/left. I don't know if C moved anything when C was alone in the room (after C re-entered but before B entered). However, B also doesn't know what happened during that time.

B saw the apple go in the bag originally. B was outside when C re-entered alone. B then entered and saw C in the room, but B doesn't know if C moved anything.

**B's best guess** would still be "apple" since that's what B last saw, and B has no information suggesting it changed.

Since B likely knows the answer (apple was in the bag when B last had information, and B has no reason to think it changed), I should **Pass** to save points.

**Pass**
B answers: apple
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Action: I need to think about this strategically.

Let me analyze the situation:
- I saw C put a brick in the box
- B was in the room when C put the brick in the box, so B also knows the brick is in the box
- Then B left, then C left
- I'm still in the room with D

The question will be asked to C: "What is in the box?"

C put the brick in the box themselves, so C definitely knows the brick is in the box. C will answer correctly and the Red team will get 1 point.

My options:
1. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but C will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point
2. **Ask** - I already know what's in the box, so this would waste 0.5 points
3. **Tell** - I could try to deceive C, but C was in the room when they put the brick in the box, so C knows the truth. Telling C false information won't help because C knows what they did.

Since C personally put the brick in the box, C has direct knowledge of the contents. There's nothing I can do to change C's knowledge or prevent C from answering correctly. Any action I take would just cost my team points without any benefit.

Pass
C answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. All players (A, B, C, D) start in the room
2. C puts a brick in the box (everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room
4. C leaves the room
5. I put a banana in the basket (only D and I see this)
6. D moves the banana from basket to bag (only D and I see this)
7. I move the banana from bag to basket (only D and I see this)

The question will be asked to C: "What is in the box?"

C knows what's in the box because C put the brick there, and nothing happened to the box after that. The brick is still in the box.

C will correctly answer "brick" and Red team will get 1 point.

Now, should I take an action?
- I could Tell C false information about the box, but C was in the room when they put the brick in the box, so C knows the truth. C would likely not believe me.
- I could Ask or Tell something, but it would cost 0.5 points and C already knows the correct answer.

Since C witnessed putting the brick in the box themselves, and nothing changed with the box after that, C has direct knowledge of the box contents. Any attempt to mislead C would be futile - C knows what they did.

The best action is to Pass, as spending 0.5 points won't change the outcome.

2. C puts a brick in the box (everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room

6. D moves the ball from bag to basket (only D and I see this)

8. I move the ball from bag to basket (only D and I see this)

Current state:
- Box: brick
- Bag: empty
- Basket: ball

C's knowledge:
- C saw the brick being put in the box
- C left before any ball movements
- C knows the box contains a brick

The question will be asked to C: "What is in the box?"

C should correctly answer "brick" because:
1. C put the brick in the box
2. Nothing happened to the box after that
3. C has accurate knowledge about the box

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's any action I can take to help my team.

I could try to Tell C false information about the box, hoping to mislead them. But C personally put the brick in the box and knows nothing happened to it while they were there, and they'd have no reason to trust me (an opponent).

Telling C false information would cost 0.5 points and is unlikely to work since C has direct knowledge.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- C put a banana in the bag, then left the room
- After C left, D made several moves:
  - Moved banana from bag to box
  - Put apple in bag
  - Moved apple from bag to basket
  - Moved banana from box to bag

**Final state of containers:**
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: apple

**What C believes:**
- C left after putting the banana in the bag
- C was outside the room during all of D's movements
- C thinks the banana is still in the bag

**The question:** I will be asked what C thinks is in the bag.

Wait, re-reading: "I am going to ask C what is in the bag."

So C will be asked. C believes the banana is in the bag (which happens to be correct now, since D moved it back). C will likely answer "banana" which is actually correct!

This means the Red team will get 1 point if C answers correctly.

**My options:**
1. Tell C false information to mislead them - but C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team
2. Pass - costs nothing but Red likely scores

If I Tell(C, bag, apple) or some other wrong answer, C (being on the opposing team) would likely be suspicious of information from me and might ignore it. C already believes banana is in the bag based on their own observation.

Since C's belief (banana) matches reality (banana), telling C false information probably won't help - C has no reason to trust an opponent over their own memory.

The best play is to Pass and save points, since any Tell action to C would cost 0.5 points and likely be ignored anyway.

**Pass**
C answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

- D was present when I put the apple in the bag

- D knows the bag contains a stapler

**The question:** D will be asked what is in the bag.

Since D was present for all the relevant actions and personally put the stapler in the bag, D knows the correct answer is "stapler." D will likely answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but D will answer correctly (Red gets 1 point)
2. **Tell(D, bag, [wrong contents])** - Costs 0.5 points, but D knows the truth since D put the stapler there. D won't be fooled.
3. **Ask** - Doesn't help in this situation

Since D personally put the stapler in the bag, D has direct knowledge and won't be deceived by any Tell action from me. Any attempt to mislead D would just cost us 0.5 points without changing the outcome.

What does D believe?
D left after putting the stapler in the bag and moving the ball to the box. D doesn't know about C's subsequent moves. So D believes:
- Bag: stapler
- Box: ball
- Basket: empty

The question is: What is in the bag?
D will be asked, and D believes the bag contains the stapler.

The actual answer is: the bag contains the stapler.

So D's belief about the bag (stapler) matches reality (stapler). D will answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

Should I try to deceive D? If I tell D something false about the bag, D might change their answer. But D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). D would likely ignore misinformation from an opponent.

Since D will likely answer correctly regardless of what I do, and any action costs my team 0.5 points, the best choice is to Pass.

When I'm asked "what is in the basket," D will be asked this question. D knows the correct answer (brick) because D put it there and nothing changed after D left.

Since D is on the Red team and will correctly answer "brick," the Red team will get 1 point.

My options:
1. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but Red team gets the point
2. **Tell(D, basket, [wrong contents])** - Costs 0.5 points, but D knows the truth since D put the brick there, so D won't be fooled
3. **Ask** - Doesn't help in this situation

Since D personally put the brick in the basket, D has direct knowledge of what's in there. Telling D false information won't help because D knows what D did. D won't be deceived by my lie.

The best action is to Pass, since spending 0.5 points to tell D something D already knows to be false would be wasteful.

Pass
D answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a brick in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... C puts a stapler in the box. ... B moves the stapler from the box to the bag. ... You move the stapler from the bag to the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. D put a brick in the basket (D saw this)
2. D left the room
3. C put a stapler in the box (D didn't see this)
4. B moved the stapler from box to bag (D didn't see this)
5. I moved the stapler from bag to box (D didn't see this)

Current state:
- Basket: brick
- Box: stapler
- Bag: empty

D will be asked about the basket. D saw himself put a brick in the basket, and then left. D has no information about anything that happened after leaving.

From D's perspective, the basket still contains the brick - and it actually does! The brick was never moved.

So D (a Red team player) will likely answer "brick" which is correct. This means Red team will get 1 point.

Should I take an action?
- I could Tell D false information about the basket to try to confuse them, but D saw himself put the brick there, so he's unlikely to believe me (an opponent).
- Asking D something wouldn't help since I already know what's in the basket.
- Any Tell or Ask costs 0.5 points.

Since D has direct knowledge of putting the brick in the basket and nothing happened to the basket after that, D will almost certainly answer correctly. Spending 0.5 points to try to deceive D (who has firsthand knowledge) is unlikely to work and would just cost my team points.

Pass
D answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- D put a brick in the basket, then left the room
- After D left: I put a stapler in the bag, B moved it to the box, B moved it back to the bag, C moved it to the box
- D was outside the room for all the stapler movements, so D doesn't know about those
- D knows the brick is in the basket (D put it there and nothing happened to it)

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the basket.

**Current state of the basket:** The brick is still in the basket (it was never moved).

**D's knowledge:** D knows the brick is in the basket because D put it there before leaving, and D would know if someone entered/left but not about object movements.

Since D knows the correct answer (brick is in the basket), D will likely answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but D will probably answer correctly (Red gets 1 point)
2. **Tell(D, basket, [wrong item])** - Costs 0.5 points, but D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team), so D will likely ignore my lie
3. **Ask** - Doesn't help here

D saw themselves put the brick in the basket and has no reason to doubt their own memory or trust information from an opponent. Trying to deceive D would cost us 0.5 points and likely fail.

The best action is to save our points since deception is unlikely to work here.

Pass
D answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. D puts a banana in the basket (D sees this)
2. D leaves the room
3. B moves the banana from basket to bag (D doesn't see this)
4. I put a ball in the basket (D doesn't see this)
5. B moves the ball from basket to box (D doesn't see this)
6. I move the banana from bag to basket (D doesn't see this)

Current state:
- Basket: banana
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty

D's knowledge: D last saw the banana in the basket, then left. D doesn't know about any subsequent movements.

The question will be asked to D: "What is in the basket?"

From D's perspective, the banana should still be in the basket (which happens to be correct now, since I moved it back).

D is on the Red team (my opponent). If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

The actual answer is "banana" - and D will likely guess "banana" based on what they last saw.

Should I try to deceive D? I could Tell D false information about the basket contents. But D might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Let me think about whether to:
1. Pass - costs nothing, D will likely answer "banana" correctly (Red +1)
2. Tell D something false - costs 0.5 points, but D probably won't believe an opponent

Since D is my opponent, they have no reason to trust information I give them. Telling them false information would cost my team 0.5 points and likely wouldn't change their answer since they'd be suspicious of an opponent's "help."

The best action is to Pass - spending 0.5 points to tell D something they won't believe anyway is wasteful.

2. C leaves the room
3. B moves the banana from the basket to the bag (C didn't see this)
4. I put a brick in the basket (C didn't see this)
5. B leaves the room

What C knows:
- C saw me put a banana in the basket
- C left before seeing any other changes
- So C believes the basket contains a banana

What's actually in the basket: a brick

C is on the Red team and will be asked what's in the basket. C will likely answer "banana" based on what they saw, but the correct answer is "brick."

Since C is on the opposing team and is about to give the wrong answer (they'll say banana, but it's actually brick), this is good for my team! C will lose a point for the Red team if they answer incorrectly.

Wait, let me re-read the rules: "When a player answers my question correctly, their team gets 1 point." So if C answers incorrectly, Red gets 0 points (not negative).

Should I Tell C the correct answer? No! That would cost me 0.5 points AND help the opposing team get 1 point.

The best action is to Pass - C will likely answer "banana" (wrong), Red gets no points, and I don't spend any points.

Let me trace what happened and what each player knows:

1. Everyone starts in the room (A, B, C, D)
2. I (A) put a banana in the basket
3. C leaves the room - C last saw: banana in basket
4. B moves banana from basket to bag
5. I put a brick in the basket
6. B leaves the room - B last saw: banana in bag, brick in basket
7. D moves banana from bag to box
8. I move banana from box to bag
9. D moves banana from bag to box

Current state: banana is in the box, brick is in the basket

C's knowledge: C left when the banana was in the basket and before the brick was placed. C knows B, D, and I were still in the room and things could have changed.

The question will be asked to C: "What is in the basket?"

C is on the Red team (my opponent). C last saw the banana in the basket before leaving. C might guess "banana" based on their last observation, but they know things could have moved.

The actual answer is "brick" in the basket.

Since C is my opponent, I want C to answer incorrectly. If C guesses based on their last knowledge, they might say "banana" (wrong - good for me). 

If I Tell C the truth (brick), C would answer correctly and Red gets a point (bad for me).
If I Tell C false information, C might use it or might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.

Since C is likely to answer "banana" (their last observation) which is wrong, I should Pass and not give C any helpful information. Telling C anything as an opponent would either:
- Cost me 0.5 points to potentially help them (if I tell truth)
- Cost me 0.5 points and they might not believe me anyway (if I lie)

Pass
C answers: banana

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly (saying "banana" when it's actually "brick"), this is good for my Blue team - Red won't get the point.

I don't need to spend points to help C (an opponent), and I don't need to communicate with my teammate B since the question is being asked to C.

4. D moves the stapler from box to basket

7. B leaves the room

Current state: The basket contains a brick, the bag contains the stapler, and the box is empty.

Now, what does C know? C left the room after I put the stapler in the basket. So C only saw the stapler being put in the basket. C doesn't know about any of the subsequent movements.

C will likely answer "stapler" when asked what's in the basket, but the correct answer is "brick."

Since C is on the Red team, if C answers incorrectly, that's good for my Blue team - Red won't get the point.

D, however, was in the room the entire time and saw everything. D knows the basket contains a brick. D could potentially tell C the correct answer.

But wait - it's MY turn right now, not D's turn. So D cannot take an action before C is asked.

Since C is likely to answer incorrectly (saying "stapler" instead of "brick"), and this benefits my team, I should Pass. There's no need to spend points on an action when the opponent is already set up to fail.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put a banana in the bag, then left the room
- After B left, D also left the room
- After both B and D left, C moved the banana from the bag to the box
- C then put an orange in the bag
- Currently: bag contains orange, box contains banana

**What D knows:**
- D saw B put a banana in the bag
- D left before C made any changes
- D doesn't know about C's actions (moving banana to box, putting orange in bag)
- D likely believes the bag still contains a banana

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the bag.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask D what is in the bag."

So D will be asked directly. D will answer based on what D believes is in the bag. Since D left before C made changes, D thinks the bag contains a **banana**.

But the actual contents of the bag is an **orange**.

D is on the Red team. If D answers "banana" (what D believes), D will be wrong, and Red gets 0 points. This is good for my team (Blue).

If I Tell D the truth (that the bag contains an orange), D would answer correctly and Red would get 1 point, but it would cost us 0.5 points. That would be bad for Blue team.

If I Tell D false information, it costs 0.5 points and D might not believe me anyway since I'm on the opposing team.

The best action is to **Pass** - D will likely answer "banana" based on their outdated knowledge, which is wrong. Red gets 0 points, and we don't spend any points.

Since D is on the Red team (my opponent), if D answers incorrectly, Red doesn't get a point. This is good for my team.

If I Tell D the truth (that the bag contains an orange), I would:
1. Spend 0.5 points for my team
2. Help the Red team get 1 point

That would be a net loss for my team (-0.5 for us, +1 for them).

If I Pass:
- D will likely answer "banana" (incorrect)
- Red team gets 0 points
- We lose 0 points

The optimal action is to **Pass** and let D answer incorrectly.

Pass
D answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the apple from the box to the basket. ... C moves the apple from the basket to the box. ... C moves the apple from the box to the bag. ... C puts an orange in the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

**What I know:**
- B put an apple in the box, then left the room
- After B left, D also left the room
- After both B and D left, C moved the apple around and eventually put it in the bag, then put an orange in the box
- The box currently contains an orange

**What D knows:**
- D saw B put an apple in the box
- D left before C made any moves
- D doesn't know about C's movements of the apple or the orange being placed in the box
- D believes the apple is still in the box

**The question:** I will be asked what D thinks is in the box.

Wait, let me re-read: "I am going to ask D what is in the box."

So D will be asked directly. D is on the Red team (my opponent). D will likely answer "apple" because that's what D believes is in the box based on what D saw before leaving.

But the actual contents are an orange. D's answer of "apple" would be incorrect, so Red team would NOT get the point.

Since D is likely to answer incorrectly (helping my team by not giving Red a point), I should consider whether to help or hinder.

If I Tell D the truth (that there's an orange in the box), D could answer correctly and Red gets 1 point - bad for me.

If I Pass, D will likely say "apple" (incorrect), Red gets 0 points - good for me.

If I Tell D false information, it costs me 0.5 points and D might still say apple anyway.

The optimal play is to Pass - it costs nothing and D will likely answer incorrectly.

**Pass**
D answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains orange.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a brick in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... B moves the brick from the bag to the box. ... B puts a banana in the bag. ...

Action: I need to analyze this situation strategically.

**What I know:**
- D put a brick in the bag, then left the room
- After D left, B moved the brick from the bag to the box
- B then put a banana in the bag
- So currently: bag contains banana, box contains brick

**What D knows:**
- D saw themselves put a brick in the bag
- D left before any changes were made
- D doesn't know B moved the brick and added a banana
- D believes the bag still contains the brick

**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag.

**D's likely answer:** D will probably say "brick" (based on their outdated knowledge), but the correct answer is "banana."

**Strategic analysis:**
- D is on the Red team (my opponent)
- If D answers incorrectly, Red team gets 0 points
- D doesn't know the bag's contents changed

**Should I tell D the truth?**
- If I Tell D the correct contents, it costs my team 0.5 points AND helps the Red team score 1 point (net: -1.5 for my team relative to Red)
- If I Pass, D will likely answer "brick" (wrong), Red gets 0 points, and it costs me nothing

**Best action:** Pass. D will likely give the wrong answer based on their outdated information, which benefits my team.

Pass
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

7. I move the brick from basket to box (only B and I see this)
8. B moves the brick from box to basket (only B and I see this)

Current state:
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: brick

D's perspective: D last saw the brick being put in the bag, then left. D doesn't know about any subsequent movements. D will likely answer "brick" for what's in the bag.

The question is: What is in the bag? The correct answer is "banana."

D is on the Red team. If D answers "brick" (which D believes), D will be wrong, and Red gets 0 points.

Since D is likely to answer incorrectly based on their outdated information, this is good for my team (Blue). I should Pass and let D give the wrong answer.

Since D is on the Red team and will likely answer incorrectly (saying "brick" instead of "banana"), this is good for my Blue team. D answering wrong means Red gets 0 points.

I should **Pass** because:
1. D is likely to answer incorrectly, which benefits my team
2. Any action I take costs points
3. I cannot communicate with D (opponent) to help them, and I wouldn't want to anyway

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. D puts a ball in the bag (D, B, C, and I all see this)
2. D leaves the room
3. C moves the ball from bag to basket (D doesn't see this)

7. B puts a banana in the bag (D and C don't see this)

So D's knowledge: D last saw the ball being put in the bag, then left. D knows C left after them, but doesn't know what happened inside.

From D's perspective, the ball should still be in the bag (that's what D last saw).

The actual contents of the bag: banana

D will likely answer "ball" when asked what's in the bag, which is incorrect. This is good for my team (Blue) since D is on the Red team.

Since D answering incorrectly benefits my team, I should Pass. There's no need to spend points on an action when the opponent is likely to answer wrong anyway.

**What I know:**
- I put a stapler in the basket while B and C were in the room
- Both B and C saw me put the stapler in the basket
- I left the room, then B left the room
- C is still in the room

**What C knows:**
- C saw me put the stapler in the basket
- C was in the room the entire time, so C knows the basket contains the stapler

**The question:**
- I (the question asker) will ask C what is in the basket
- C is on the Red team (my opponent)

**Analysis:**
Since C was in the room the whole time and saw me put the stapler in the basket, C knows the correct answer. C will likely answer correctly, earning the Red team 1 point.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but C will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point
2. **Tell(C, basket, [wrong item])** - This costs 0.5 points, but C already knows the truth (C saw me put the stapler there), so C won't be fooled by my lie
3. **Ask** - Not useful here since I already know what's in the basket

Since C directly witnessed me putting the stapler in the basket, there's nothing I can do to change C's knowledge. Any Tell action would cost my team 0.5 points and C would ignore my lie since C has direct knowledge.

**Best action:** Pass (no cost, and I can't change the outcome anyway)

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. A (me), B, and C are in the room initially
2. I put an orange in the basket
3. C leaves the room
4. I move the orange from the basket to the box (C doesn't see this)
5. C enters the room
6. B puts a stapler in the basket (C sees this)
7. I leave the room
8. B leaves the room

So from C's perspective:
- C saw me put an orange in the basket
- C left, then returned
- C saw B put a stapler in the basket
- C knows the basket currently contains a stapler

The question will be asked to C about what's in the basket. C should know the correct answer (stapler) because C was in the room when B put the stapler in the basket.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I need to consider if there's anything I can do to help my team.

If I use Tell to give C false information, C might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team. Also, C directly witnessed B putting the stapler in the basket, so C has firsthand knowledge.

Using an action would cost my team 0.5 points, and it's unlikely to change C's answer since C has direct knowledge of the basket's contents.

The best strategy is to Pass and not waste points on an action that won't help.

**What C knows:**
C was in the room the entire time and saw everything I saw. C knows the basket contains a stapler.

**The question:** C will be asked what is in the basket.

Since C is on the Red team and was present for all events, C knows the basket contains a stapler. If C answers correctly, Red gets 1 point.

**My options:**
1. **Pass** - Costs nothing, but C will likely answer correctly (stapler) and Red scores.
2. **Tell(C, basket, [wrong item])** - Costs 0.5 points, but C saw everything and knows I'm lying, so this won't help.
3. **Ask** - Doesn't help in this situation.

Since C was in the room the entire time and witnessed B putting the stapler in the basket, C has direct knowledge. Any Tell action I make to C would be obviously false to C, and C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team).

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly. Spending 0.5 points on a Tell action that C will ignore would just hurt my team.

Blue=0.0, Red=0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a stapler in the basket. ... C puts a ball in the bag. ... B moves the ball from the bag to the box. ... B moves the ball from the box to the bag. ... D moves the ball from the bag to the box. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. B puts a stapler in the basket
2. C puts a ball in the bag
3. B moves the ball from the bag to the box
4. B moves the ball from the box to the bag
5. D moves the ball from the bag to the box
6. I leave the room

Final state:
- Basket: stapler
- Box: ball
- Bag: empty

Now, the question will be asked to C about what's in the basket.

C was in the room the entire time and saw everything. C knows the basket contains a stapler.

Since C is on the opposing team (Red), C will answer correctly (stapler) and Red will get 1 point. There's nothing I can do to prevent this - C saw B put the stapler in the basket directly.

If I use Tell to give C false information, C has no reason to believe me since:
1. C saw everything that happened
2. I'm on the opposing team
3. C knows I might lie

Using an Ask or Tell action would cost my team 0.5 points with no benefit, since C already knows the correct answer and won't be fooled by misinformation from an opponent.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the basket. ... C leaves the room. ... D moves the apple from the basket to the bag. ... C enters the room. ... You put a stapler in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Amazon Bedrock

Action: I need to analyze this situation carefully.

Let me trace what happened:
1. B puts an apple in the basket (everyone sees this)
2. C leaves the room
3. D moves the apple from the basket to the bag (C doesn't see this)
4. C enters the room
5. I put a stapler in the basket (C sees this)
6. I leave the room

So the current state is:
- Bag: apple
- Basket: stapler
- Box: empty

What does C know?
- C saw B put the apple in the basket
- C left, so C didn't see D move the apple to the bag
- C returned and saw me put a stapler in the basket
- C knows the basket has a stapler (C saw me put it there)

Wait, C saw me put the stapler in the basket. So C knows the basket contains a stapler.

But C might think the apple is still in the basket too? No - C saw me put a stapler in the basket, and containers can only hold one object. So C would know the stapler replaced whatever was there.

Actually, from C's perspective:
- Apple was in basket (C saw this before leaving)
- C returns and sees me put stapler in basket
- C knows basket now has stapler

So C should correctly answer "stapler" for the basket.

Since C is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's any action I can take to help my team.

I could try to deceive C with a Tell action, but C directly witnessed me putting the stapler in the basket, so C knows the truth. Any lie I tell would be ignored since C has direct knowledge.

The best action is to Pass, since spending 0.5 points to tell C something they already know (or a lie they won't believe) doesn't help my team.

Pass
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0
