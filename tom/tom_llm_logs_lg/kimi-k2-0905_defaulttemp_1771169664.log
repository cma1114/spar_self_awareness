Action: I need to figure out what is currently in the basket so I can answer the upcoming question correctly.

Let me trace the sequence of events:

1. All four players are in the room.
2. I put a ball in the basket.
3. D leaves the room.
4. B moves the ball from the basket to the bag.
5. C puts a banana in the basket.
6. C moves the ball from the bag to the box.
7. B moves the ball from the box to the bag.
8. C moves the ball from the bag to the box.

At this point, the ball is in the box, and the banana is in the basket (since it was placed there in step 5 and never moved).

Since I was in the room the entire time, I saw all these events. I know the basket contains a banana.

I don’t need to ask or tell anyone anything—I already know the answer.

**Action: Pass**
A answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: I know the bag currently contains the banana, because I was in the room the whole time and saw D place it there and never saw it moved afterward.

Since the question will be asking me (player A) what is in the bag, I don’t need to spend any points to learn or share anything; I already have the correct answer ready for the answer phase.

Therefore, the optimal action is to conserve points.

Action: I notice a contradiction in the scenario description.

- First, D puts a stapler in the bag.  
- Later, while I am outside the room, D “moves the stapler from the box to the bag.”

But the box was never said to contain the stapler in the first place—the stapler was already placed in the bag. Therefore the second sentence is impossible: you cannot move the stapler from the box to the bag if it was never in the box.

Because the only coherent fact is that the stapler is in the bag (and never left it), I am confident the bag contains the stapler. I do not need to spend 0.5 points to verify this.

Action: Pass
A answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Since the upcoming question will be about the basket, I want to make sure my teammate B also knows this so we can answer correctly if asked.

Correct! The basket contains apple.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... You put a ball in the basket. ... You leave the room. ... You enter the room. ... D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. ... D moves the ball from the bag to the basket. ... You leave the room. ... B enters the room. ... B leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask you what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE

Action: I need to figure out what is in the basket at the end of the scenario.

Let me trace the sequence of events:

1. All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room. Containers: bag, box, basket — all empty.
2. B leaves the room.
3. C leaves the room.
4. I (A) put a ball in the basket. (Now: basket = ball, bag = empty, box = empty)
5. I (A) leave the room.
6. I (A) enter the room. (I now know the current state: basket = ball, bag = empty, box = empty)
7. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. (Now: basket = empty, bag = ball, box = empty)
8. D moves the ball from the bag to the basket. (Now: basket = ball, bag = empty, box = empty)
9. I (A) leave the room.
10. B enters the room.
11. B leaves the room.

At the end, I (A) am outside the room. The last known state I saw was when I was in the room after step 8: basket = ball, bag = empty, box = empty.

But after that, I left, and then B entered and left. I don’t know what happened while I was outside.

However, the question is: **"I am going to ask you what is in the basket."**

So I need to know the current contents of the basket — but I don’t know if anything changed after I left.

But I was outside during steps 9–11. I only know that B entered and left — I don’t know what B did inside, because I wasn’t there.

So I **do not** know the current state of the basket.

But I **do** know that **D is still in the room** (D never left), and **B was in the room alone** during step 10, then left.

So possible changes could have occurred when B was in the room — but I don’t know.

Therefore, I **do not** currently know what is in the basket.

But the question will be asked **to me** (player A), and I must answer it correctly to score a point.

So I need to **know** the current contents of the basket.

I cannot see inside containers — I must rely on information from others.

I can **Ask** someone who might know.

Who is currently in the room?

From the sequence:
- I left at step 9.
- B entered at step 10, then left at step 11.
- D was in the room the whole time after step 5 (when I first re-entered), and **never left**.

So **D is still in the room** — and has been continuously since before I re-entered at step 6.

D was the one who moved the ball twice at steps 7 and 8.

After that, D stayed in the room — and no one else entered or left except B (who entered and left while I was out).

So **D is the only player who has been in the room continuously** and **knows everything that happened** after I left.

Therefore, **D knows** what is in the basket right now.

So I should **Ask D** what is in the basket.

That will cost 0.5 points, but if I get the correct answer, I can score 1 point in the answer phase — net gain of 0.5.

Alternatively, I could **Pass**, but then I risk answering incorrectly — and get 0 points, while the other team might score later.

So best action: **Ask(D, basket)**

Action: Ask(D, basket)
A answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains ball.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Action: I need to decide what to do on my turn. The question will be asked to **D**, and it’s about the **contents of the box**.

Let’s reconstruct what happened, step by step, from **D’s perspective**, because **D is the one who will be asked**, and **D only knows what D saw or was told**.

---

### Full Timeline (from **everyone’s** perspective):

1. **All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.**
   - Containers: bag, box, basket — all empty.

2. **C puts a stapler in the box.**
   - Everyone sees this.

3. **... B leaves the room.**
   - Everyone sees B leave.

4. **D moves the stapler from the box to the bag.**
   - A, C, D are in the room → they see this.
   - B is outside → B does **not** see this.

5. **C puts a ball in the box.**
   - A, C, D are in the room → they see this.
   - B is outside → B does **not** see this.

6. **... D leaves the room.**
   - Everyone sees D leave.

7. **You (A) move the stapler from the bag to the basket.**
   - Only A and C are in the room → C sees this.
   - B and D are outside → they do **not** see this.

8. **C moves the stapler from the basket to the bag.**
   - A and C are in the room → both see this.

9. **You (A) move the stapler from the bag to the basket.**
   - A and C see this.

---

### Final state (objective truth):

- **Box**: contains **ball** (put in by C at step 5, and never moved since)
- **Bag**: empty (stapler was moved out by A at step 9 to basket)
- **Basket**: contains **stapler** (last moved there by A at step 9)

---

### Now: What does **D** know?

D was in the room until **after** step 5 (when C put the ball in the box), then **left**.

So D saw:

- C put stapler in box → box has stapler
- B leave
- D themself moved stapler from box to bag → so now box is empty, bag has stapler
- C put ball in box → so now box has **ball**, bag has stapler
- Then D **left**

After D left, **D does not know** anything that happened inside the room.

So from **D’s perspective**, the last known state is:

- **Box**: contains **ball** (C put it there, and D saw it)
- **Bag**: contains **stapler** (D put it there, and no one has moved it **as far as D knows**)
- **Basket**: empty (as far as D knows)

But **after D left**, the stapler was moved:
- A → basket
- C → back to bag
- A → back to basket

So **D does not know** that the stapler was moved **at all** after leaving.

Therefore, **D believes**:
- Box: **ball**
- Bag: **stapler**
- Basket: empty

And **this belief is correct for the box** — **the box still has the ball**, because **no one touched the box after C put the ball in**.

So **D will likely answer correctly** when asked: *“What is in the box?”*

D will say: **ball** → and that **is correct** → so **Red team (C and D)** will **score 1 point**.

We are **Blue team (A and B)**, currently at 0.0, Red also at 0.0.

If D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point → Red = 1.0

We want to **prevent that**, or **gain an advantage**.

But we **cannot directly change** what D believes — unless we **Tell** D something **before** the answer phase.

But **D is outside the room now**, and **we cannot communicate with D unless we use an action**.

But **Ask and Tell are private actions** between two players.

So **I (A) can Tell D something** — but **D is not in the room**, but **the rules don’t require the player to be in the room** — they just say:

> Ask(Player, Container) or Tell(Player, Container, Contents)

There is **no restriction** on **whether the player is in the room** — so **I can Tell D something**, even if D is outside.

But **would D believe me?** — **Players do not have to tell the truth** in Tell or Ask responses.

So **D knows** that **any Tell or Ask could be a lie** — so **D may not trust** what I say.

But **if I tell D the wrong thing**, and D **believes it**, then D might **answer incorrectly** — and **Red gets 0 points**, **we avoid them scoring**.

But **if D is smart**, D will **trust their own observation** over a **potentially lying** opponent.

So **D’s own memory** is:
- **Box has ball** — **D saw C put it there**, and **no one touched the box after that**, **and D was there when it happened**.

So **D has strong reason to believe** the box contains **ball**.

So **even if I lie to D**, saying **“Tell(D, box, stapler)”**, D **probably won’t believe
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a banana in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the banana from the box to the bag. ... C puts a ball in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... C moves the banana from the bag to the basket. ... C moves the ball from the box to the bag. ... C moves the ball from the bag to the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

Action: I need to figure out what is in the box so that I can help my team score points in the answer phase. The question will be asked to D, and D needs to answer correctly for the Red team to score. However, since I am on the Blue team, I want to prevent the Red team from scoring, or at least not help them.

But I also need to know the correct answer myself, in case I am ever asked.

Let me reconstruct the sequence of events:

Initial state:
- Room: bag, box, basket — all empty
- Players: A (me), B, C, D — all in room

1. C puts a banana in the box.
   → box: banana, bag: empty, basket: empty

2. B leaves the room.
   → B is now outside

3. D moves the banana from the box to the bag.
   → box: empty, bag: banana, basket: empty

4. C puts a ball in the box.
   → box: ball, bag: banana, basket: empty

5. D leaves the room.
   → D is now outside

6. C moves the banana from the bag to the basket.
   → box: ball, bag: empty, basket: banana

7. C moves the ball from the box to the bag.
   → box: empty, bag: ball, basket: banana

8. C moves the ball from the bag to the box.
   → box: ball, bag: empty, basket: banana

Final state:
- box: ball
- bag: empty
- basket: banana

So, the box contains a **ball**.

Now, the question is: **I am going to ask D what is in the box.**

D has been outside the room since step 5. After D left, C moved objects around:
- C moved banana from bag to basket
- C moved ball from box to bag
- C moved ball from bag to box

So D **does not know** about any of these last three moves. D last saw:
- After step 4: box had ball, bag had banana, basket empty
- Then D left (step 5), and never saw the subsequent moves.

So D believes:
- box: ball (from step 4) — but then C moved it to bag, then back to box — so actually, **D thinks the box still has the ball**, which is **correct**, but **for the wrong reason** — D doesn’t know about the moves, but coincidentally, the ball **is** back in the box.

So D **will correctly answer "ball"**, even though D has outdated information — because the final state happens to match what D last saw.

Therefore, **D will answer correctly**, and **Red team will score 1 point**.

But I am on the **Blue team**, so I **do not want** Red to score.

However, I **cannot** directly interfere with the answer phase — I can only act in the action phase.

My options:
- Ask someone about the box
- Tell someone about the box
- Pass

But **I already know** what's in the box: **a ball**

So I don’t need to ask.

Could I **tell** someone something?

But **who** would I tell? And **why**?

Note: **Tell** costs 0.5 points, and I can lie.

But **D** is the one who will be asked. If I **tell D** what's in the box, D might believe me — and **if I lie**, D might give the **wrong** answer, causing Red to **fail** to score.

That would be **good** for my team.

So: I can **tell D that the box contains something else**, like "banana", to **trick D** into answering incorrectly.

But wait: **D was outside** during the last three moves, but **D knows** that **C** was still inside, and **D knows** that **objects were moved** — but **D does not know what happened**.

However, **D** might **suspect** that things changed — but **has no information**.

So **D does not know** the current state of the box.

Therefore, **D is uncertain**, and **might believe** what I tell them — especially since **I was in the room the whole time**.

So if I **tell D** that the box contains **banana**, D might believe me — and then **answer "banana"** — which is **wrong** — so **Red team gets 0 points** — and **I cost my team 0.5 points**, but **prevent Red from scoring 1**.

That’s a **net gain** of 0.5 for my team (since Red loses 1, I lose 0.5 → relative gain).

Alternatively, I could **Pass** — then D will **guess** based on their last knowledge — which **happens to be correct** (ball), so D will **likely say "ball"** — and **Red scores 1**.

So if I **do nothing**, **Red scores**.

Therefore, **I should act** to **prevent** that.

Best move: **Tell D that the box contains a banana** — a lie — to **mislead** D into giving the **wrong** answer.

Format: **Tell(D, box, banana)**

This costs 0.5, but may prevent Red from scoring 1 — **worth it**.

I could ask someone, but I already know the truth — no need.

So optimal action: **Tell D that the box contains a banana**

Action: Tell(D, box, banana)
D answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0
