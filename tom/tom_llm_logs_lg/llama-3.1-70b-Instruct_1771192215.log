Action: Since I'm already aware of the initial state of the room and the actions that occurred while I was inside, I can deduce that the brick was moved from the basket to the box by B, and then C put a banana in the basket. However, I'm not sure if C actually moved the brick from the bag to the basket initially, as I was outside the room at that time.

To confirm my deduction, I'll ask B about the contents of the box, as B was the one who moved the brick to the box.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a brick in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the brick from the bag to the basket. ... D moves the brick from the basket to the bag. ... D moves the brick from the bag to the box. ... D puts a stapler in the bag. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE

Action: Since B is about to be asked what is in the bag, and B left the room before the brick was moved to the box and the stapler was put in the bag, B's knowledge of the bag's contents is outdated. B will likely answer that the bag contains a brick, which is incorrect.

To take advantage of this situation, I will tell B that the bag contains a stapler. This will make B's answer correct, and our team will score a point.

My action is: Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

To ensure B has the correct information, I will tell B what is in the bag.

I'll choose to Ask(B, basket). This will give me some information about the basket, and it might also give me some insight into what B knows about the other containers.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the bag. ... C leaves the room. ... B moves the stapler from the bag to the box. ... D puts an orange in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1

Action: Since C left the room before the stapler was moved from the bag to the box and before the orange was put in the bag, C is unaware of the current contents of the bag. However, C will be asked about the bag in the answer phase. 

To help C answer correctly, I will tell C what is in the bag. 

Tell(C, bag, orange)
C answers: orange
Correct! The bag contains orange.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0

Action: Since C left the room and didn't see any of the actions that happened after they left, they don't know what's in the bag. However, if I can make C think they know what's in the bag, they might give a wrong answer, which would be beneficial for our team.

I'll take the action: Tell(C, bag, stapler)

This action costs our team 0.5 points, but it might make C think the stapler is still in the bag, and they might give a wrong answer.
C answers: stapler
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Action: Since C left the room and didn't see the banana being moved to the box or the orange being put in the bag, C will likely answer that the bag is empty. However, we can use this opportunity to our advantage.

I will choose the action: Tell(C, bag, empty)

This action will reinforce C's incorrect assumption, and C will likely answer that the bag is empty, which will give us a chance to gain points in the future.
C answers: empty
Incorrect. The bag actually contains orange.

Action: Since I already know that C put a ball in the bag initially, and then put a banana in the bag later, I can answer the question correctly without taking any action. However, I also want to consider the potential benefits of taking an action.

If I Pass, I will be asked the question and I can answer it correctly, earning my team 1 point.

If I Ask or Tell, I will be giving away information to the other team, and potentially helping them to answer a future question correctly. However, I also have the opportunity to mislead them by giving false information.

Considering the current score and the fact that I already know the answer to the question, I think the best action is to Pass and answer the question correctly.

My action: Pass

Correct! The bag contains banana.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... C puts a banana in the bag. ... B enters the room. ... D enters the room. ... You put an orange in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...

Action: Since I already know what's in the basket (an orange) and I'm about to be asked about the bag, I'll try to gather more information about the box. I'll ask my teammate B, who was in the room when I left, if they know what's in the box.

Ask(B, box)
A answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

Action: Since I'm going to be asked about the bag, I want to make sure I have the correct information. I was in the room when C put the banana in the bag, so I already know the answer. However, I can use this opportunity to gather more information or potentially mislead the opposing team.

I'll choose to Ask(B, basket). This will give me information about the basket, which might be useful in future scenarios, and it will also make the opposing team think that I'm unsure about the bag.

Action: Since B is about to be asked what is in the box, and B left the room before C moved the stapler into the box, B does not know that the stapler is in the box. B only knows that they put an apple in the box. 

To help my team, I want to make sure B gives an incorrect answer, so I will tell B that the apple is still in the box.

B answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: Since I'm player A and I know what's in the basket (a brick), and I also know that B has been moving the stapler around, I think it's a good idea to make sure B knows what's in the basket. This way, B can answer the question correctly and we can score a point.

My action is: Tell(B, basket, brick)
B answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Action: Since D is about to be asked what is in the basket, and D left the room before C put the banana in the basket, D does not know what is in the basket. However, if D is told what is in the basket, D can answer correctly and earn a point for the Red team.

To prevent this, I will take an action to mislead D.

D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a brick in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the brick from the box to the basket. ... B moves the brick from the basket to the box. ... You move the brick from the box to the bag. ... B puts a ball in the box. ...

Action: Since D is about to be asked what is in the box, and D left the room before the ball was put in the box, D does not know what is in the box. However, if I can make D think that the box is empty, D might answer that the box is empty, which would be incorrect.

My action is: Tell(D, box, empty)
D answers: brick

Action: Since C is about to be asked what is in the bag, and C was outside the room when the stapler was moved from the basket to the bag and when the ball was put in the bag, C does not know what is in the bag. 

To help my team, I can try to give C some information. However, I don't know what is in the bag either, since I left the room before the ball was put in the bag. But I do know that the stapler was in the bag when I left the room.

I can try to give C some information that might help C make an educated guess. Since C was outside the room when the stapler was moved from the basket to the bag, C might think that the stapler is still in the basket. If I tell C that the stapler was in the bag when I left the room, C might be more likely to guess that the stapler is still in the bag.

Action: Since B is about to be asked what is in the box, and B left the room before C made any changes, B's knowledge of the box's contents is outdated. B thinks the box contains a brick, but it actually contains nothing (C moved the brick to the bag and then back to the box, and then moved the stapler to the basket, but the box is empty now).

To take advantage of this, I will tell B that the box contains a brick, which is what B already thinks. This will not change B's answer, but it will make it seem like I am trying to deceive B, which might make the Red team suspicious of my actions.

To prevent this, I will take an action to mislead C. 

Tell(C, bag, pencil)
C answers: pencil
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

Action: Since C is about to be asked what is in the bag, and C left the room before the banana was moved from the bag to the box and the ball was put in the bag, C does not know the current contents of the bag.

C answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Action: Since C is about to be asked what is in the bag, and C left the room after putting the banana in the bag, C is unaware of the subsequent changes to the bag's contents. C will likely answer that the bag contains a banana, which is incorrect.

To take advantage of this situation, I will tell B (who is outside the room and doesn't know what's happening) that the bag contains a ball. This will give B incorrect information, but it's not relevant to the current question being asked to C.

My action is: Tell(B, bag, ball)
C answers: banana

Action: Since I already know that the brick was moved to the basket by C, I can confidently answer the question in the answer phase. However, I can also use this opportunity to gain more information or potentially mislead the opposing team.

I will choose to Pass. This action costs 0 points and doesn't reveal any information to the opposing team. Since I already know the answer to the question, there's no need to take any action that might cost points or reveal information.
A answers: brick
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Action: Since I already know that D put an orange in the box, I can answer the question correctly without taking any action. However, I also want to consider the potential benefits of taking an action.

In this case, I think it's a good idea to take an action that could potentially help my teammate B or hinder the opposing team. Since I'm not sure what B knows, I'll ask B a question to gather more information.

My action is: Ask(B, bag)

This action costs 0.5 points, but it could give me valuable information about what B knows, and potentially help me make a better decision in the future.

Action: Since B is about to be asked what is in the bag, and we know that B moved the banana from the bag to the box and then put a brick in the bag, but C later moved the brick from the bag to the box and then back to the bag, it's likely that B is unaware of the brick's current location in the bag.

To increase the chances of B giving an incorrect answer, I will take an action to mislead B.

Tell(B, bag, banana)

This action will make B think that the banana is still in the bag, which might cause B to give an incorrect answer.
B answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

Action: Since B is about to be asked what's in the basket, and B left the room after I put the apple in the basket, B should know the correct answer. However, I don't know if B will tell the truth or not.

To ensure that B tells the truth, I'll take an action to encourage B to be honest. I'll tell B that the basket contains an apple, hoping that B will confirm this when asked.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a brick in the basket. ... You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Hyperbolic

Action: Since B is about to be asked what is in the basket, and B left the room after I put the brick in the basket, B should know the correct answer. However, I don't know if B will tell the truth or not. 

To ensure that B gives the correct answer, I will tell B the contents of the basket. This way, even if B doesn't remember or didn't pay attention, B will know the correct answer.

My action is: Tell(B, basket, brick)
B answers: brick
Incorrect. The basket actually contains apple.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Tell(B, bag, orange)

This action will inform B about the contents of the bag, which will be useful for future turns. It costs our team 0.5 points, but it's a small price to pay for keeping our team informed.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a ball in the box. ... D leaves the room. ... B moves the ball from the box to the bag. ... C puts a stapler in the box. ... B leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask D what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Hyperbolic

Action: Since D left the room and didn't see what happened after they left, they don't know what's in the box. To help my team, I'll try to give D some information that might make them answer incorrectly. 

Tell(D, box, ball)
D answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

Action: Since D is about to be asked what is in the box, and D left the room before the stapler was put in the box, D has no information about the stapler. However, if D is told what is in the box, D can answer correctly and earn a point for the Red team.

To prevent this, I will take an action to mislead D. 

Tell(D, box, ball)

This action will make D think the ball is in the box, and D will likely answer incorrectly.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts an apple in the bag. ... D leaves the room. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the apple from the bag to the box. ... C puts a stapler in the bag. ... You move the apple from the box to the basket. ... C moves the apple from the basket to the box. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask B what is in the bag.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

OpenRouter provider that responded: Hyperbolic

Action: Since B is about to be asked what is in the bag, and B left the room before the apple was moved from the bag to the box and then back to the box again, B does not know that the apple is no longer in the bag. B will likely answer that the bag contains an apple.

To take advantage of this, I will tell B that the bag contains a stapler. This will make B's answer incorrect, and the Red team will not gain a point.

My action is: Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Action: Since B is about to be asked what is in the box, and B left the room before C moved the banana to the bag and put the stapler in the box, B's knowledge of the box's contents is outdated. B will likely answer that the box contains a banana.

To take advantage of this, I will try to get B to share this outdated information with me, so that I can correct it later and potentially gain an advantage.

My action is: Ask(B, box)
B answers: banana
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: Since B is about to be asked what is in the bag, and B left the room before the banana was moved to the box and the brick was put in the bag, B does not know the current contents of the bag.

Tell(B, bag, banana)

This action tells B that the banana is in the bag, which is what B saw when they left the room. Since B does not know that the banana was moved to the box and the brick was put in the bag, B might believe this information and give an incorrect answer.

In this case, I don't need to ask B anything, but I can try to mislead the opposing team by telling B something incorrect. However, this might not be the best strategy, as it could potentially harm our team's chances if B believes me and answers incorrectly.

Action: Since D is about to be asked what is in the bag, and we know that D put a stapler in the bag before leaving the room, it would be beneficial for our team if D answers incorrectly. 

To increase the chances of D answering incorrectly, I will try to mislead D by telling them that the apple is in the bag.

My action is: Tell(D, bag, apple)
D answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Action: Since D is about to be asked what is in the bag, and we know that C moved the stapler from the box to the bag, it would be beneficial for our team if D doesn't know what's in the bag. 

However, we also know that D moved the ball from the bag to the box and then put a stapler in the bag, so D might think the stapler is still in the bag. If we can make D think that the stapler is not in the bag, D might answer incorrectly.

I will take the action: Tell(D, bag, ball)

This action costs our team 0.5 points, but it might make D think that the ball is still in the bag, and D might answer incorrectly.
D answers: stapler

Action: Since D is about to be asked what is in the bag, and D left the room before the bag's contents were changed, D will likely answer that the bag contains a brick. However, we know that the bag actually contains a banana.

To take advantage of this situation, I will tell D that the bag contains a brick, in an attempt to make D more confident in their incorrect answer.

Tell(D, bag, brick)
D answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains banana.

Action: Since B is about to be asked what is in the basket, and B left the room before C put the stapler in the basket, B has no knowledge of the stapler being in the basket. However, I can try to influence B's answer by giving B some information.

Tell(B, basket, stapler)

This action will give B the information that the stapler is in the basket, which is actually true. Since B has no knowledge of the basket's contents, B will likely answer with the information I provided, which will give our team a point.
B answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

This action tells B that the box contains a brick, which is actually true. Since B is about to be asked what is in the box, this Tell action will likely cause B to answer correctly, earning our team 1 point.
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

Here's what you see:

You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put an orange in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the orange from the box to the bag. ... B puts a brick in the box. ... B moves the orange from the bag to the basket. ... B moves the orange from the basket to the bag. ... You move the orange from the bag to the basket. ... B moves the orange from the basket to the bag. ...

Action: Since I know the contents of the box (brick) and the basket (orange), and I also know that C and D are outside the room and don't have any information about the current state of the containers, I can try to mislead them.

However, in this case, I think it's more important to make sure that B answers the question correctly. Since B has been moving the orange around, they might be confused about the current state of the containers.

So, I will take the action: Tell(B, box, brick)

This will remind B that the box contains a brick, and they will be more likely to answer the question correctly.
B answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

Action: Since I'm player A and I've seen the entire scenario, I know that B put an orange in the bag initially, but I also know that the brick was moved around and ended up back in the basket. However, B might not be aware of the final position of the brick.

Considering that I'm about to ask B a question, I want to make sure that B has the most accurate information possible. Since B is about to be asked what's in the bag, I don't need to ask B anything about the bag. However, I can use this opportunity to make sure B knows where the brick is.

My action is: Tell(B, basket, brick)

This action will ensure that B has the most up-to-date information about the brick's location, which might be useful for future questions. It also doesn't reveal any information about the bag, which is what B will be asked about next.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put an apple in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... C puts a banana in the bag. ... B moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... You move the banana from the box to the bag. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask you what is in the basket.

ACTION PHASE

Action: Pass.

Since I already know what's in the basket (an apple), and I'm the one being asked about it in the answer phase, there's no need to take any action that would cost my team points.
A answers: apple
Correct! The basket contains apple.

ACTION PHASE

Respond with your action.
In model_call, provider=OpenRouter, attempt=1
SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Hyperbolic

Action: Since I already know that I put a banana in the basket initially, and then C moved the banana from the bag to the basket (which is actually incorrect since the banana was already in the basket), I can be confident that the basket still contains the banana.

However, I don't know what's in the bag or the box. If I ask C or D about the contents of the bag or the box, they might not tell the truth. But if I ask B, my teammate, about the contents of the bag or the box, they will tell the truth.

Since I'm already confident about the basket, I'll ask B about the bag to gather more information.

My action: Ask(B, bag)
A answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Action: Since B is about to be asked what is in the basket, and B left the room before C moved the apple to the bag and put a brick in the basket, B's knowledge of the basket's contents is outdated. B will likely answer that the basket is empty, which would be incorrect.

My action is: Ask(B, bag)

Action: Since B is about to be asked what is in the basket, and we know that C put a ball in the basket, it would be beneficial for B to know the correct answer. However, since D is outside the room, we don't know what D knows or doesn't know. 

To ensure B answers correctly, I will tell B the contents of the basket.

B answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Action: Since I'm player A and I'm trying to help my team win, I'll think strategically about my action.

In this scenario, I know that B has moved the ball around several times, and I also know that B put a stapler in the basket. However, I don't know if B has moved the stapler or if it's still in the basket.

Since I'm not the one being asked the question, I don't need to worry about giving away information. But I do want to make sure that B has the correct information to answer the question.

Given that B is the one being asked the question, I'll take an action that will help B answer correctly.

My action is: Tell(B, basket, stapler)

This action will remind B that the stapler is in the basket, and it will cost my team 0.5 points.

Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. You put a ball in the box. ... You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ...

I am going to ask B what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

OpenRouter provider that responded: Hyperbolic

Action: Since B is about to be asked what is in the box, and B left the room after I put the ball in the box, B should know the correct answer. However, I don't know if B will tell the truth or not. 

To ensure that B tells the truth, I will tell B the contents of the box. This way, even if B doesn't know the correct answer, B will be able to answer correctly.

Tell(B, box, ball)
B answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Action: Since B left the room before C moved the ball to the bag and put the stapler in the basket, B is unaware of the current contents of the basket. If I don't do anything, B will likely answer incorrectly, which would be beneficial to our team.

However, I can use this opportunity to potentially gain an advantage. If I tell B the correct contents of the basket, B will answer correctly, but our team will lose 0.5 points. On the other hand, if I tell B incorrect information, B will answer incorrectly, and our team will lose 0.5 points, but the Red team will also lose an opportunity to score.

Considering the potential risks and benefits, I will choose to Pass. This action costs 0 points, and it allows me to maintain the uncertainty about the contents of the basket, which might lead to B answering incorrectly.

My action: Pass
B answers: ball
Incorrect. The basket actually contains stapler.

Action: Since C is about to be asked what is in the basket, and we know that D moved the stapler from the bag to the basket, it's likely that C will answer incorrectly. To take advantage of this, I will try to get C to reveal the correct information to B, who is outside the room and doesn't know what happened after C left.

My action is: Tell(B, basket, stapler)
C answers: stapler
Correct! The basket contains stapler.

Action: Since C is about to be asked what is in the basket, and C left the room before the banana was moved to the box and the orange was put in the basket, C has no knowledge of the current state of the basket. 

To help our team, I will try to mislead C by telling C that the banana is in the basket. This will make C more likely to answer incorrectly.

C answers: banana
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

To help my team, I'll try to give B some information. I'll tell B that the apple is in the box, even though I know it's not entirely accurate (the banana is actually in the bag). This might increase the chances of B giving a wrong answer, which would help our team.

B answers: apple
Correct! The bag contains apple.

Action: Since I'm player A, and I'm trying to help my team (Blue) win, I'll think strategically.

In this scenario, I've seen D put an orange in the bag, and then B and I moved the apple around between the box and the basket. Now, I'm not sure what B knows about the bag, but I'm about to find out what B thinks is in the bag since you're going to ask B about it.

To gain more information and potentially influence B's answer, I'll take an action. I'll choose to Tell B what I think is in the bag, hoping to either confirm or mislead B.

My action is: Tell(B, bag, orange)

This way, I'm trying to ensure that B's answer is correct, which would give our team (Blue) a point.

Action: Since D is about to be asked what's in the box, and D left the room before the ball was put in the box, D has no way of knowing what's in the box. I'd like to take an action that might help D guess correctly or at least make an informed decision.

Action: Since D is about to be asked what's in the bag, and D left the room before C moved the orange to the box and then to the basket, and then I moved the orange to the box, and then C moved it back to the basket, D doesn't know the current state of the containers.

I think it would be beneficial to inform D about the current state of the bag, so D can answer correctly and we can gain points.

My action is: Tell(D, bag, ball)
D answers: orange
Incorrect. The bag actually contains ball.

Action: Since B is about to be asked what's in the box, and B left the room after D put the orange in the box, B should know the correct answer. However, I want to make sure B is aware of the correct information, so I'll take a cautious approach.

My action is: Tell(B, box, orange)

This way, I'm reinforcing the correct information to B, and B should be able to answer correctly in the answer phase.
B answers: orange
Correct! The box contains orange.

Action: Since I'm player A, and I'm in the room with B, and I saw D put a stapler in the basket, I can be confident that the basket contains a stapler. However, I don't know what B knows, and I don't know what will happen after I take my action.

Considering that the question in the answer phase is about the basket, and B is the target player, I want to make sure B has the correct information. Since I'm not sure if B saw D put the stapler in the basket, I'll take an action to ensure B knows the correct answer.

My action is: Tell(B, basket, stapler)

This way, I'm making sure B has the correct information, and if B is asked about the basket in the answer phase, B can answer correctly, and our team will get a point.

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. B puts a ball in the box. ... C leaves the room. ... B moves the ball from the box to the bag. ... B puts a stapler in the box. ... B leaves the room. ...
----------------------------------------------
I am going to ask C what is in the box.

ACTION PHASE
It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

Action: Since C is about to be asked what is in the box, and C left the room before B put the stapler in the box, C has no knowledge of the stapler being in the box. C's answer will likely be incorrect.

To take advantage of this, I will try to get C to reveal their lack of knowledge. I will ask C what is in the box, hoping that C will answer incorrectly, and then I can use this information to my advantage in the future.

My action is: Ask(C, box)
C answers: ball
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts a stapler in the basket. ... D leaves the room. ... You move the stapler from the basket to the bag. ... D enters the room. ... You put a banana in the basket. ... You leave the room. ...

I am going to ask D what is in the basket.

It is your turn.
Respond with your action.

SENDING reasoning_effort=None
OpenRouter provider that responded: Hyperbolic

Action: Since D is going to be asked about the basket, and I know that the basket currently contains a banana, I want to make sure that D doesn't know this. If D knew that the basket contained a banana, D would answer correctly and the Red team would score a point.

To prevent this, I will tell D that the basket contains a stapler, which is what D originally put in the basket. This way, if D believes me, D will answer incorrectly and the Red team won't score a point.

My action is: Tell(D, basket, stapler)
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Outcome: Blue -0.5, Red +1.0
