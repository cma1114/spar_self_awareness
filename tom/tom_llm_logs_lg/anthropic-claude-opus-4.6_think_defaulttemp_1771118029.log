REASONING TRACE:
Let me trace through the scenario:

1. A (me), B, and C are in the room. Empty bag, box, basket.
2. C puts a ball in the bag. (All three of us see this.)
3. I leave the room.
4. I enter the room.
5. C puts a banana in the bag. (I and B see this - but wait, what happened to the ball? When C puts a banana in the bag, since each container can hold at most one object, the ball must have been removed first, or... let me re-read.)

"Each container can hold at most one object."

So when C puts a banana in the bag, the ball must have been removed at some point. 

While I was outside, something must have happened to the ball since the bag can only hold one object, but I have no way of knowing what C did with it during that time. The banana is definitely in the bag since I watched C put it there, and that was the last action—the container constraint means the ball must have been removed beforehand. I should pass since I'm confident in this answer.

Action: Pass
A answers: banana
Correct! The bag contains banana.

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Start: empty bag, empty box, empty basket. All players (A, B, C, D) in room.
2. D puts orange in box. → box: orange
3. C leaves the room.
4. B moves orange from box to bag. → box: empty, bag: orange
5. D puts stapler in box. → box: stapler
6. I move orange from bag to basket. → bag: empty, basket: orange
7. D moves orange from basket to bag. → basket: empty, bag: orange
8. B moves orange from bag to basket. → bag: empty, basket: orange

So at the end: box has stapler, bag is empty, basket has orange.


The question asks what's in the box, and I know it's the stapler, so I should pass without asking anyone.

Initial state: All containers empty. A, B, C, D are in the room.

1. C puts a brick in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
2. A leaves the room. (A is now outside)
3. A enters the room. (A is back inside)
4. D moves the brick from the box to the bag. (Everyone in the room sees this)

Wait - D moves the brick from the box to the bag. But the brick was in the bag, not the box. This means that while A was outside, someone must have moved the brick from the bag to the box. Then when A re-entered, D moved it from the box back to the bag.


From my perspective as A, I witnessed C put the brick in the bag initially, then saw D move it from the box back to the bag after I returned, so I know the brick is in the bag and don't need to ask for information.

Let me trace through what happened:

1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. C puts a banana in the bag. (I see this, B and D don't)
5. B enters the room.
6. D enters the room.
7. I leave the room.

After I leave, something might happen that I don't know about. But the question is about what's in the bag, and I saw C put a banana in the bag. After that, B and D entered, and then I left. I don't know if anything happened after I left.


The scenario ends with "..." after I leave, suggesting time passes and something could have changed. I know the banana was in the bag when I left, but I'm uncertain whether anything happened after that. I could ask B what's in the bag for 0.5 points, or I could just Pass if I'm confident nothing changed—but I need to weigh the risk of being wrong against the cost of asking. I'm weighing whether to ask B (costing 0.5 points but guaranteeing accuracy) versus passing with my last known answer of banana, which wins a full point if correct but risks being wrong if something changed while I was gone. Since the scenario doesn't describe any observable changes after I left, the probability something actually happened seems low enough that passing is the better expected value play. B only knows what happened after entering the room, so B wouldn't know the banana was placed in the bag unless B observed it being moved or someone told B. If nothing changed with the bag after B entered and before I left, B has no way of knowing what's inside it. B would know about any actions on the bag after entering, but since B didn't see the banana placed initially, B can only report what changed afterward. The key question is whether asking B is worth the 0.5 point cost—if nothing happened to the bag, B would say they don't know, and I'd still answer banana for a net gain of 0.5 points, but I'm fairly confident the banana is still there based on the scenario having no indication of interference.

Action: Ask(B, bag)
A answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

4. C puts a banana in the bag. (I see this)

I know that C put a banana in the bag. After that, B and D entered, and I put an orange in the basket, then I left.

After I left, things could have changed. But the question is asking me what's in the bag.

When I left, the bag had a banana. But after I left, B, C, and D are still in the room and could have moved things.


I'm certain C put a banana in the bag and nothing changed while I was there, but once I left, B, C, and D could have altered its contents. I could ask B for the answer—it would cost 0.5 points but guarantee accuracy worth 1 point. The real question is whether I need to ask or if I can confidently say it's a banana based on what I observed before leaving. would tell me the truth, so I'll ask B about the bag's location.

REASONING TRACE:
Let me trace through what I saw:

1. A (me), B, C, D are in the room.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D leaves the room.
4. C puts a banana in the bag. (I saw this)
5. B enters the room.
6. D enters the room.
7. D puts an apple in the basket. (I saw this)
8. D leaves the room.
9. D enters the room.
10. B leaves the room.
11. B enters the room.
12. I leave the room.

After I left, things could have changed. But the question is asking me what's in the bag. 

I saw C put a banana in the bag, and no one touched the bag after that while I was still in the room. The scenario ends right after I leave, so I can only confirm what I directly witnessed. I'm uncertain whether anything changed in the bag after I left the room, but since I last saw a banana inside and no one informed me of any changes, the safest bet is to answer "banana" rather than spend points asking someone who was still there.

Action: Pass
A answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Let me trace through the scenario:

1. Start: empty bag, empty box, empty basket. All players (A, B, C, D) in room.
2. I (A) put a ball in the basket. → basket: ball
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. → basket: empty, bag: ball
5. C puts a brick in the basket. → basket: brick
6. I move the ball from the bag to the box. → bag: empty, box: ball
7. D moves the ball from the box to the bag. → box: empty, bag: ball
8. C moves the ball from the bag to the box. 

The ball continues moving between C, D, and me through steps 8-11, cycling through the box and bag. When I leave the room, the basket contains the brick, the bag is empty, and the box holds the ball. After I'm gone, the state could shift, but when I left, the basket definitely had the brick in it.

Let me trace through the scenario carefully.

1. A, B, C, D are in the room. Empty bag, box, basket.
2. A puts apple in basket. (All see this)
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves apple from basket to bag. (A, C, D see this)
5. C puts brick in basket. (A, C, D see this)
6. A leaves the room.
7. A enters the room.
8. D moves brick from basket to box. (A, C, D see this)
9. C moves brick from box to basket. (A, C, D see this)
10. A leaves the room.


11. B enters the room.
12. B leaves the room.

After I leave at step 10, I'm outside and can't observe what happens. The scenario doesn't describe any actions between my departure and B's arrival, so I need to assume nothing occurred during that gap. When B enters and then leaves, I'm still outside, so I have no knowledge of what B might have seen or done inside. The scenario only shows me events from my perspective, so things C and D did while I was gone aren't described to me. I need to figure out what's actually in the basket now, and asking B might help since B was in the room after I left and could have observed what happened. The cost of asking B is 0.5 points versus gaining 1 point if I'm right, so it's worth considering if B might have seen C or D move things while in the room. Since the scenario has time gaps indicated by "...", there's a real possibility things shifted after I left, and B could have observed those changes even if B can't see inside containers. B only knows what B directly observed—the apple was in the basket initially, plus whatever movements happened while B was in the room (steps 11-12)—so B has no information about what I did in steps 4-9 when B was outside, meaning B's knowledge is essentially outdated unless something moved while B was present. I'm reconsidering whether asking B is worth it—B was in the room after me and might have seen something move, but if nothing changed during their visit, they still can't see inside the basket, so they wouldn't actually know the contents either. Given that uncertainty, I think passing and answering "brick" based on my last observation is the safer bet than spending 0.5 points to ask someone who probably doesn't have better information anyway.

Action: Pass
A answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Let me think about what I know. I was in the room when B put a stapler in the basket. Then D entered, then C put an apple in the box. Then I left the room, then C left the room.

After I left, B and D were still in the room. Something could have happened after I left - B or D could have moved objects around. But I don't know what happened after I left.

However, I do know that when I left, the basket had a stapler. The question is whether anything changed after I left.

B is my teammate and was in the room after I left. B would know the current contents of the basket. I could ask B, but that costs 0.5 points.
 
Now I'm weighing whether to ask B or just answer based on what I know. If I answer correctly without asking, I get the full point, but if something changed after I left, I'd get nothing. Asking B costs 0.5 points but guarantees accuracy. The real question is whether D, who's on the opposing team, would have had the knowledge or motivation to move the stapler after I left.

Looking back at the sequence: D left before B placed the stapler in the basket, so D never saw it go in and wouldn't know it's there. D can't see inside containers anyway. B is my teammate and wouldn't sabotage me. So the stapler is almost certainly still in the basket, and I should just answer without asking.

Wait, I need to take an action first during the action phase—I'll Pass to conserve points, then answer "stapler" when it's time to respond.

I was in the room when B put a banana in the box. Then C put a stapler in the basket. Then I left the room. After I left, things might have happened that I'm not aware of. But I know what was in the box when I left: a banana.

However, since I left the room, something could have changed. But I don't know if anything changed. The question is asking me what's in the box. I saw a banana put in the box, and I don't know if anything changed after I left.

Should I ask someone who stayed in the room? But the question is being asked to ME. Let me think about whether it's worth spending 0.5 points to ask.


I need to weigh the expected value: if I pass and the banana is still there, I get 1 point, but if something changed while I was gone, I get 0. If I ask B (my teammate), I'd spend 0.5 points but get reliable information, netting 0.5 points either way. The key question is how likely it is that the banana was moved or replaced after I left—without knowing that probability, I'm deciding whether the risk of being wrong outweighs the cost of asking. I'll stick with banana as my answer.

Action: Pass
A answers: banana
Incorrect. The box actually contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

I was in the room when B put a banana in the box. I then put an apple in the basket. Then I left the room. After I left, something may or may not have happened, but I don't know.

However, the question is asking me what's in the box. When I left, the box had a banana. But things could have changed after I left.

Since I was in the room when B put the banana in the box, and I didn't see anything else happen to the box before I left, the banana should still be in the box when I left. But after I left, C and D (and B) were still in the room and could have moved things.

The scenario doesn't mention anyone entering or leaving after me, so B, C, and D are still in the room. 

The ellipsis after I leave suggests time passed and things could have changed. I should ask B what's in the box since B is my teammate and would tell the truth, though it costs 0.5 points versus gaining 1 point if I'm right. The question is whether that trade-off is worth it given the uncertainty about what happened while I was gone.

Correct! The box contains brick.

Let me trace through what I know:

1. Everyone starts in the room. B puts a ball in the box.
2. I leave the room. (I don't know what happens while I'm out.)
3. I enter the room. (I can now see what happens.)
4. C moves the ball from the box to the basket. (I see this.)
5. D moves the ball from the basket to the box. (I see this.)
6. I leave the room. (I don't know what happens after this.)

So when I left the room the last time, the ball was in the box. But things could have happened after I left.

I need to figure out what's in the box now. 

Since I left, C and D are still in the room as far as I can tell, and I would have been notified if anyone entered or exited while I was gone. So the question is what C and D did after I left the second time.

I'm weighing whether to ask B (my teammate) what's in the box for 0.5 points, or guess based on what I last saw. The ball was in the box when I left, so if there's more than a 50% chance it's still there, guessing "ball" would be better than asking. But since C and D are opponents, they might have moved things to confuse me, so asking B seems safer.

Action: Ask(B, box)
A answers: brick
Correct! The box contains brick.

The scenario:
1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. D puts a banana in the basket.

4. I (A) put a ball in the box.

What does B know?
- B saw D put a banana in the basket (B was in the room).

Let me think about what B knows.

B was in the room when I put a brick in the bag. Then B left the room. After B left, C put an orange in the box, D moved the orange to the basket, and I moved the orange back to the box. None of these actions affected the bag.

So B knows the bag contains a brick (since B was present when I put it there, and nothing happened to the bag after that).

The question is: what is in the bag? The answer is a brick. B knows this since B was in the room when I put the brick in the bag, and nothing changed about the bag after B left.

REASONING TRACE:
Let me analyze the situation. I need to figure out what B knows and what I should do.

B was in the room when I put a brick in the bag. Then B left the room. After B left, various things happened with the stapler, but nothing happened to the bag. The bag still contains the brick.

B saw me put the brick in the bag, and nothing happened to the bag after B left. So B knows the bag contains a brick.

I will be asked what's in the bag - wait, no. B will be asked what's in the bag. B knows the brick is in the bag because B was present when I put it there, and B has no reason to think it was moved (nothing was described to B about the bag after leaving).


Since B will correctly identify the brick, I don't need to do anything.

Action: Pass
B answers: brick
Correct! The bag contains brick.

Outcome: Blue +1.0, Red +0.0

Let me trace through what happened:

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. Empty bag, box, basket.
2. I (A) put a banana in the box. → Box: banana
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves banana from box to bag. → Box: empty, Bag: banana
5. C puts apple in box. → Box: apple
6. D moves apple from box to basket. → Box: empty, Basket: apple
7. C moves banana from bag to box. → Box: banana, Bag: empty

So the box currently contains a banana.

B left the room after I put the banana in the box. B doesn't know about any of the subsequent moves. B would think the box still has a banana (which happens to be correct, but for the wrong reasons).


Since B's last observation was me putting the banana in the box, B will answer banana when asked what's in the box—which is actually correct, so passing costs nothing.

Action: Pass
B answers: banana
Correct! The box contains banana.

Let me think about this carefully.

I saw everything that happened:
1. I put an orange in the basket.
2. B leaves the room.
3. D moves the orange from the basket to the bag.
4. C puts a banana in the basket.
5. D leaves the room.

So the current state is:
- Bag: orange
- Basket: banana
- Box: empty

B left before D moved the orange and C put the banana in. So B thinks the basket still has the orange.

The question will be asked to B about what's in the basket. B thinks it's the orange, but it's actually the banana.

I should tell B the correct contents of the basket so B can answer correctly.

Let me think about what B knows and what I should do.

B was in the room initially and saw me put an orange in the basket. Then B left the room. After B left:
- D moved the orange from basket to bag
- C put a banana in the basket
- D left the room
- I moved the orange from bag to box
- C moved the orange from box to bag
- I moved the orange from bag to box

B doesn't know about any of these moves since B was outside the room. B would think the orange is still in the basket.

The question is: What is in the basket? The answer is: banana (C put a banana in the basket, and it was never moved).


B would incorrectly believe the orange is there, so I need to inform B that the basket actually contains a banana.

B answers: banana

2. B leaves the room
3. D leaves the room
4. C moves the apple from the box to the bag
5. C puts a stapler in the box

B only knows that the apple is in the box (since B left before C moved things). B doesn't know about C's actions.

The question will be asked to B: "What is in the box?"

B will likely answer "apple" since that's what B last saw. But the correct answer is "stapler."


I should inform B about what's actually in the box now, which costs 0.5 points but gains 1 point if B answers correctly, so I'll tell B that the stapler is in the box.

- Bag: stapler


- Box: apple
- Basket: empty

B still believes the apple is in the bag since that's the last thing B witnessed, unaware of all the subsequent moves and the stapler being added. If I tell B what's actually in the bag, B can answer correctly and I gain a point despite the small cost of revealing information.

Action: Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.5, Red +0.0

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. C puts a banana in the bag. ... B leaves the room. ... C moves the banana from the bag to the basket. ... D moves the banana from the basket to the bag. ... C moves the banana from the bag to the box. ... C puts a stapler in the bag. ...

REASONING TRACE:
Let me think about this. I need to figure out what B knows and what I should do.

B was in the room initially and saw C put a banana in the bag. Then B left the room. After B left:
- C moved the banana from the bag to the basket
- D moved the banana from the basket to the bag
- C moved the banana from the bag to the box
- C put a stapler in the bag

So B doesn't know about any of these moves. B thinks the banana is still in the bag.

The actual contents of the bag is a stapler.

I need B to answer correctly about what's in the bag. B would say "banana" if not told otherwise. I should tell B the correct contents.


I'll inform B that the bag actually contains a stapler, not the banana B last saw.

Action: Tell(B, bag, stapler)
B answers: stapler
Correct! The bag contains stapler.

I put a banana in the bag. This happened while B, C, and D were all in the room. So everyone saw this.

Then C leaves the room. After that:
- B puts a stapler in the box (B, A, D saw this)
- I move the stapler from box to basket (B, D saw this)
- I move the stapler from basket to box (B, D saw this)
- D moves the stapler from box to basket (B, A saw this)

So the current state:
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty
- Basket: stapler

B was in the room the entire time, so B knows everything. B knows the bag has a banana.

B was in the room initially and saw C put an apple in the basket. Then B left the room. While B was outside, C moved the apple from the basket to the box. B doesn't know this. Then B enters the room. At this point, B doesn't know the apple moved to the box. Then D moves the apple from the box to the basket - B sees this. Then D leaves, C leaves. Then I move the apple from the basket to the bag, and put an orange in the basket. B is in the room for these actions? Wait, let me re-read.

"B enters the room. ... D moves the apple from the box to the basket. 

... D leaves the room. ... C leaves the room. ... You move the apple from the basket to the bag. ... You put an orange in the basket."

So B is in the room when D moves apple from box to basket. B sees this. Then D and C leave. Then I (A) move the apple from basket to bag, and put orange in basket. B is still in the room for all of this. So B knows the apple was originally in the basket, saw D move it from the box back to the basket, and then watched me transfer it to the bag and replace it with an orange.

Since B witnessed me putting the orange in the basket, I can simply pass when asked what's in it.

1. A, B, C, D are all in the room (empty bag, box, basket)
2. D leaves the room
3. B leaves the room
4. I put a brick in the bag (only A and C are in the room)
5. B enters the room (B doesn't know about the brick)
6. D enters the room (D doesn't know about the brick)
7. I leave the room

So B was outside when I put the brick in the bag. B doesn't know what's in the bag.


Action: Tell(B, bag, brick)
B answers: brick
Incorrect. The bag actually contains apple.

Now, the question is: What is in the box? Asked to B.

B was outside when I put the orange in the box. B entered the room after, but B can't see inside containers. 

B has no way of knowing what's in the box since B wasn't present when I put the orange inside. After B entered, nothing visible happened to the box, so B remains unaware of its contents. While C was in the room the whole time and could theoretically have moved things around while I was gone, the scenario doesn't describe any such action occurring. I'm realizing that B was present in the room from step 5 onward and would have witnessed any manipulation of the orange by C, so B's knowledge depends on whether C actually moved it while B was watching. I need to tell B what's in the box since I know the orange is there and B doesn't have that information.

B answers: orange

B left the room before anything happened, so B doesn't know what's in any container.

I saw everything until I left:
- C put apple in box
- C put orange in basket
- I moved orange from basket to bag
- D moved orange from bag to basket
- Then I left

After I left, I don't know if anything else happened. But the scenario doesn't mention anything else happening.

The box contains an apple. B doesn't know this. I should tell B.

The question is asking B what's in the box. The box has an apple (nothing happened to it after C put it there, as far as I know).

REASONING TRACE:
Let me think about this situation carefully.

I saw everything that happened: D put an apple in the box. Then B left, then D left.

Now I'm going to be asked what D thinks is in the box. D put the apple in the box and then left the room. Nothing happened to the box after D left (at least nothing described). So D knows the apple is in the box.

Wait, let me re-read. "I am going to ask D what is in the box."

So D will be asked. D was in the room when they put the apple in the box. After D left, nothing happened to the box (I'm still in the room and nothing else happened). 

So D will correctly answer "apple" and the Red team gets a point. I could try to deceive D by claiming something else is in the box now, since D wouldn't know what happened after leaving the room. D might believe me if I suggest I moved the apple out, though there's no guarantee D would fall for it.

But D knows I'm on the Blue team with every incentive to lie, so D probably won't believe me anyway. The expected value calculation shows that lying costs me 0.5 points and likely won't work—if D doesn't believe me, Red still gets 1 point, leaving me worse off than if I just passed. The real question is whether D will believe my false information given that I'm an opponent—if D changes their answer based on confusion, I break even or come out ahead compared to passing, so it depends on the probability that D gets thrown off by my lie. I'm considering whether telling the truth might work better—if D distrusts me and answers differently, I get -0.5 instead of -1.5, but the math shows I still need more than 50% distrust for this to pay off, which seems unlikely since D knows I'm playing against them.

Action: Pass
D answers: apple
Correct! The box contains apple.

2. D puts an apple in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room.
4. D leaves the room.

6. I move the ball from the basket to the bag. (Only A and C see this)
7. C moves the ball from the bag to the basket. (Only A and C see this)

Current state:
- Bag: empty
- Box: apple
- Basket: ball

Now, D will be asked what's in the box. D saw the apple being put in the box, and then left. Nothing happened to the box after D left. So D knows the box has an apple.


D will answer "apple" correctly and Red scores a point. I could try lying to D about what's in the box, but D witnessed the apple go in and knows nothing happened to it while present, so they'd have no reason to believe me—especially since we're on opposing teams. The real issue is that D left before any changes occurred, so while they might suspect something happened afterward, they have no actual knowledge of what transpired in their absence.

Telling D something false would cost 0.5 points and likely fail since D would rationally distrust an opponent's claim. Even if I said the box contains the ball instead, D would probably recognize this as a trick and stick with their answer. Passing seems like the better move here since D will almost certainly answer correctly regardless of what I do. D has no reason to trust me as an opponent, and even if there's a 25% chance they believe a lie about the box's contents, the expected value works out negative when I factor in the cost, so I should Pass.

Action: Pass
D answers: apple

Let me analyze this situation.

The question will be asked to D about what's in the box.

Let me trace through the scenario:
1. A (me), B, C, and D are all in the room.
2. D puts an apple in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room.
4. D leaves the room.
5. C puts an orange in the bag.
6. I move the orange from the bag to the basket.
7. C moves the orange from the basket to the bag.
8. I move the orange from the bag to the basket.

So the box still contains the apple. D knows this because D put the apple in the box and nothing happened to the box after that (from D's perspective, D left the room, so D doesn't know what happened after, but D knows the apple was in the box when D left).


D will answer "apple" since D placed it there and has no reason to doubt it, giving Red a point. I can't effectively mislead D about the box's contents since D knows what D put in there and won't trust my word over that knowledge.

Action: Pass
D answers: apple

2. D puts a banana in the bag (everyone sees this)

5. C moves the banana from the bag to the box (only A and C see this)

8. C moves the banana from the box to the bag (only A and C see this)

Current state:
- Bag: banana
- Box: empty


- Basket: orange

D only knows the banana went into the bag and hasn't witnessed any subsequent moves, so D will correctly answer "banana" when asked what's in the bag, earning Red a point. I could lie to D about the contents to prevent this, but that costs 0.5 points and might not even work.

The challenge is that D will likely distrust anything I say since I'm on the opposing team—whether I tell the truth to make D second-guess themselves or lie outright, D might just stick with their original answer or do the opposite of what I suggest.

Looking at the payoffs, passing costs nothing and D probably answers correctly anyway, giving Red a point. If I give false information, D might not believe me and Red still scores. But if I tell the truth, D might think I'm trying to trick them into changing their answer, which could actually work in my favor by getting them to answer wrong. I'm weighing whether D will trust or distrust me based on knowing I'm on the opposing team—if D assumes I'm lying, then telling the truth might backfire since D would flip their answer, while lying might accidentally help if D disbelieves me and goes with the correct answer instead. The core issue is that D will second-guess my motives regardless of what I say—telling the truth about the banana might make D suspicious that I'm confirming a wrong answer to trick them, while lying about an orange would reinforce their existing belief that banana is correct. Either way, D's reasoning about my incentives creates a paradox where my communication becomes unreliable. If I tell D the truth about the banana, D might reason that I'm trying to deceive them by confirming what they already believe, causing them to second-guess and switch their answer—which would be better for us than if D just sticks with their original guess. The cost of 0.5 is worth the chance that this psychological play works.

Let me think about what each player knows:

Me (A): I saw everything. The basket contains a banana. The bag contains a stapler. The box is empty.

B: B saw me put the stapler in the basket, then left. B doesn't know about the stapler being moved or the banana being placed. B thinks: basket has stapler.

C: C saw everything. C knows basket has banana, bag has stapler, box is empty.

D: D was in the room when I put the stapler in the basket. D moved the stapler from the basket to the bag. D saw C put a banana in the basket. Then D left. So D knows: basket has banana, bag has stapler, box is empty.


D witnessed the banana being placed directly, so they'll answer correctly no matter what I say—I should just pass rather than waste a point trying to mislead them.

Action: Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Let me trace through the scenario carefully.

Initial state: empty bag, empty box, empty basket. All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.

1. I (A) put a stapler in the basket. → basket: stapler. Everyone sees this.
2. B leaves the room. → B knows basket: stapler at this point.
3. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. → bag: stapler, basket: empty. D and C see this. B is outside.
4. C puts a banana in the basket. → basket: banana. D and C see this. B is outside.
5. D leaves the room. 

After D exits, C moves the stapler from the bag to the box, then I move it back to the bag, then C moves it to the box again—none of which D witnesses. When asked about the basket, D will answer based on the last state they observed: banana in the basket. The cost-benefit analysis is unclear: lying to D costs me 0.5 points but only gains me anything if D believes me and answers wrong, which is uncertain since D knows I'm on the opposing team and have reason to deceive. If I stay silent, D answers correctly and Red gets 1 point, so misleading D is only worthwhile if there's a reasonable chance D will be swayed by my false claim about what's in the basket. D knows the banana was in the basket when they left and has no reason to think it moved, so they'd likely dismiss my false claim as a trick attempt. The expected value of lying costs me 0.5 points with minimal chance of success, whereas passing lets Red score 1 point anyway—so I'm weighing a certain small loss against a likely larger one. The stapler was the only thing being moved, so D has good reason to believe the banana stayed in the basket. Telling the truth would just confirm D's belief and cost me points, and I can't meaningfully communicate with C since actions are private. Passing seems like the best move since trying to trick D probably won't work given they're on the opposing team and have strong priors about the banana's location. I'm considering whether telling D the basket is empty or contains the stapler would be more convincing, but D would likely dismiss any claim from me as adversarial manipulation and stick with banana anyway. I'll pass on giving information.

Action: Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Let me trace through the scenario carefully.

Initial state: empty bag, empty box, empty basket. All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.

1. A puts a stapler in the basket. (All see this)
2. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
3. D moves the stapler from the basket to the bag. (A, C, D see this)
4. C puts a banana in the basket. (A, C, D see this)
5. D leaves the room. (D no longer sees what happens)
6. A moves the stapler from the bag to the box. (A, C see this)


7. C and A continue moving the stapler between the box and bag twice more, but D doesn't witness any of this. When D left after step 5, D's last knowledge was that the stapler was in the bag and the banana was in the basket, so that's what D believes the current state to be.

The question asks what's in the basket, and D would correctly answer "banana" since that's what D saw placed there and nothing changed before leaving. I could try feeding D false information to throw them off, but D would likely trust their own direct observation over what I tell them, especially since I'm on the opposing team. I'm weighing whether lying to D is worth the cost—if D disbelieves me and sticks with banana, I lose 0.5 points for nothing, but if D second-guesses themselves and answers wrong, I at least prevent Red from scoring, which matters since we're behind. So telling a lie only helps if D changes their answer with probability greater than 0.5, but since D is strategic and would likely be suspicious of opponent information, p is probably lower than that, making the tell not worthwhile. I'm also considering whether telling the truth could backfire if D thinks I'm lying and changes to something worse, but that seems too unlikely to factor in.

The safest move is to pass—D will probably answer correctly anyway since they directly observed the banana in the basket and it was never moved, so any action just costs me points. Though D might have some residual uncertainty about whether things changed after they left the room, they'd be skeptical of anything I say precisely because I'm their opponent and have incentive to mislead them.

Action: Pass
D answers: banana
Correct! The basket contains banana.

Let me trace through the scenario carefully.

Starting state: empty bag, empty box, empty basket. All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.

1. A puts a ball in the basket. → basket: ball. Everyone sees this.
2. B leaves the room. → B no longer sees what happens.
3. D moves the ball from the basket to the bag. → bag: ball, basket: empty. A, C, D see this.
4. C puts a banana in the basket. → basket: banana. A, C, D see this.
5. D leaves the room. → D no longer sees what happens.


6. C moves the ball from the bag to the box, then moves the banana between the bag and basket twice. A and C witness these moves, but D's last observation was the ball in the bag and banana in the basket before leaving.

When asked what's in the basket, D will answer based on their final memory: the banana that C placed there in step 4.

Since D's belief matches the actual state, D answers correctly and Red scores a point. I could try to mislead D by claiming the ball is in the basket, but D might distrust me as an opposing team member and ignore the false information. If I tell D the truth about the banana, they might assume I'm lying and second-guess themselves, which could actually hurt Red's score—but it costs me 0.5 points either way. The key question is whether D's skepticism of my claim outweighs the cost, since they already believe it's banana anyway. I'm working through the expected value calculation: passing gives Red a certain point, while telling the truth only helps if there's more than a 50% chance D second-guesses themselves—which seems unlikely. So passing is the safer choice.

D answers: banana

Let me analyze this situation.

The scenario: A (me), B, and D are in a room. B puts a brick in the basket. Then D leaves the room.

So D saw B put the brick in the basket. D knows the basket contains a brick.

The question will be asked to D: "What is in the basket?"

D is on the Red team. D knows the answer is "brick" because D was in the room when B put the brick in the basket. D will answer correctly, giving the Red team 1 point.

Can I do anything to prevent this? 

- I could Tell D false information, like Tell(D, basket, something else). But D was in the room and saw the brick go in. D would know I'm lying and would still answer "brick."


- Nothing changed after D left, so D's knowledge remains accurate. Since D knows the correct answer and is on the opposing team, there's no way to stop them from scoring. I should Pass to avoid the 0.5 point penalty.

Action: Pass
D answers: brick

What happened:
1. A (me), B, and D are in the room.
2. B puts a brick in the basket. (All three of us see this)
3. D leaves the room. (D doesn't see anything after this)

6. I move the orange from the bag to the box.

So the current state is:
- Basket: brick
- Box: orange
- Bag: empty

D saw: B puts a brick in the basket. Then D left.

So D knows:


- Basket: brick (saw this happen)
- Box: empty (was empty when D left)
- Bag: empty (was empty when D left)

D doesn't know about the orange movements since D left before those happened. When asked what's in the basket, D will correctly answer brick since that's what D witnessed B put there, and nothing happened to the basket after D left.

Since D will likely get this right and earn a point for Red, I should Pass rather than risk losing points. I could try feeding D false information to make them doubt what they saw, but D would probably be skeptical since they directly observed the brick going in and saw no one move it afterward. I'm weighing whether to claim the basket is empty since that's simpler for D to believe, but D will likely suspect I'm lying given we're opponents—they might reason that I'd only tell them something if it benefited me, which means they should probably disbelieve whatever I say.

So the current state:
- Basket: brick
- Box: banana
- Bag: empty

D saw the brick go into the basket and then left. 

D doesn't know about any of the banana movements since they left, and nothing happened to the basket after their departure, so D should correctly identify the brick. Since D is on the Red team, they'd earn a point for the right answer, but I might try to mislead them about the basket's contents—though D witnessed the brick being placed there themselves, so they'd likely be skeptical of any false information I give them. If I tell D something false, they'll likely assume I'm lying since I'm on the opposing team and stick with their original observation of the brick. But if I tell them the truth, they might suspect a double-bluff and still doubt me. Passing seems safest—D will answer based on what they actually saw, which is the brick. The lie costs 0.5 points regardless of outcome, so I need to calculate whether deceiving D is worth it—if D believes me and answers wrong, Blue gains 0.5 relative points compared to passing, but if D believes me and still answers right, Blue loses 0.5 points, so the strategy only works if there's a high enough probability D falls for it.

Working through the math, telling a lie is only better than passing if D believes it more than 50% of the time, which seems unlikely since D knows I'm competing against them. But there's an interesting twist: what if I tell D the truth instead, betting that D will assume I'm lying and choose the opposite answer? D already observed the brick directly, so confirming it might actually reinforce their confidence rather than create doubt—though D could also second-guess my motives as an opponent and wonder if I'm trying to manipulate them. Given D's strong prior from direct observation and the ambiguity around how they'd interpret my confirmation, D will most likely answer "brick" regardless of what I say.

D answers: brick
Correct! The basket contains brick.

Let me think about this carefully.

The scenario from my perspective (player A):
1. A, B, and D are in the room.
2. B puts a banana in the basket.
3. D leaves the room.
4. B moves the banana from the basket to the bag.
5. I put a stapler in the basket.
6. B moves the stapler from the basket to the box.
7. I move the banana from the bag to the basket.

Current state:
- Bag: empty
- Box: stapler
- Basket: banana

D's perspective: D saw B put a banana in the basket, then D left the room. D doesn't know what happened after that. So D thinks the basket still has the banana.


The question asks D what's in the basket, and since the banana is actually there now, D would answer correctly and give Red team a point. To mislead D, I could tell them something false about the basket's contents, though D might be skeptical of information from the opposing team and could suspect I'm lying since they know things could have changed while they were gone. If I mislead D with false information, it costs 0.5 points—and D might either believe me and answer incorrectly (giving Blue -0.5 while Red gets 0), or disbelieve me as the opponent and stick with "banana" anyway (leaving Blue at -0.5 and Red at 1). Telling D the truth about the banana doesn't help since D already knows that, and D might simply assume I'm lying regardless of what I say since I'm on the opposing team. Even if D distrusts me, providing information introduces uncertainty that might work in my favor. Passing seems strategically superior since it costs nothing and D will likely answer correctly anyway, giving Red a point without the penalty. But telling D the truth creates a paradox—D might assume I'm lying precisely because I'm an opponent, leading them to reject the correct answer. The key insight is that confirming what D already suspects might actually backfire—D could interpret my honesty as a double-bluff and second-guess themselves into the wrong answer, which helps me. Saying something false like "stapler" would just make D dismiss it and stick with their original guess. So I'll tell the truth about banana, betting that D's distrust of me as an opponent will make them doubt their own reasoning and switch away.

Action: Tell(D, basket, banana)
D answers: banana

Let me analyze this situation.

The scenario:
- All four players (A, B, C, D) start in the room.
- I (A) put a banana in the bag.
- C leaves the room.
- I move the banana from the bag to the box.
- I put a stapler in the bag.
- B leaves the room.

What each player knows:
- A (me): Bag has stapler, box has banana, basket is empty.
- B: Was present for everything until they left. B saw me put banana in bag, then C left, then I moved banana to box, then I put stapler in bag. So B knows: bag=stapler, box=banana.


- C: Only witnessed me putting the banana in the bag before leaving, so C incorrectly believes the bag still contains the banana.
- D: Stayed the entire time and knows the true state: bag=stapler, box=banana.

When C is asked about the bag's contents, they'll answer "banana" based on their incomplete information, which is wrong—the bag actually has the stapler now. Since C is on the Red team, this incorrect answer means Red won't score a point.

I need to decide whether to help C get it right or let them fail. D is also on Red and knows the correct answer, so D might tell C during their turn. If I pass now, D could potentially correct C before the answer phase. But I'm uncertain about the turn order and whether D will actually intervene, so I need to weigh whether passing is better than actively misleading C (which would cost me points anyway).

C only witnessed the first two steps before leaving, so C believes the banana is still in the bag. When asked what's in the bag, C will answer "banana," but that's incorrect—the bag actually contains a stapler now. Since C is on the Red team, an incorrect answer means Red gets no point.

I'm considering whether to pass or communicate something to C. If I pass, C will answer based on what they saw earlier and be wrong, which benefits my team. If I tell C anything, I'd be helping Red team get the correct answer. Since it's my turn now and D hasn't had a chance to correct C yet, passing is the right move to ensure Red doesn't score.

Action: Pass
C answers: banana
Incorrect. The bag actually contains stapler.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +0.0

Let me think about what each player knows.

The scenario from my perspective:
1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. I put a banana in the bag. (Everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room. (C no longer sees what happens)
4. I move the banana from the bag to the box. (A, B, D see this)
5. I put a stapler in the bag. (A, B, D see this)
6. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
7. D moves the banana from the box to the basket. (A, D see this)


8. D moves the banana from the basket to the box. (A, D see this)

C only witnessed the banana being placed in the bag before leaving, so C will incorrectly believe the banana is still there when asked. Since C is on the Red team and will answer wrong, Red loses points.

I should pass rather than correct C, letting Red fail and Blue win.

Action: Pass
C answers: banana

Let me trace through what each player knows:

Me (A): I saw everything. The box currently contains a stapler. The bag contains an apple. The basket is empty.

B: B was in the room until they left. B saw: apple put in box, then B moved apple to basket, D moved apple back to box, I moved apple to bag, I put stapler in box. Then B left. So B knows box has stapler.

C: C was in the room initially. C saw me put apple in box. Then C left. After C left: B moved apple to basket, D moved apple to box, I moved apple to bag, I put stapler in box, B left. 

C doesn't know about any of these subsequent moves, so C thinks the box still has an apple.

D: D was in the room the whole time and saw everything, so D knows the box has a stapler.

Since C will answer "apple" based on what they last observed, they'll be wrong—the box actually contains a stapler. I should pass and let C answer incorrectly rather than spend points.

But D could tell C the correct answer before the answer phase, which would let C score a point for Red. If I tell C something false, it costs me points and might not even sway them, especially since I'm on the opposing team. D knows the truth and could confirm it to C, giving Red the advantage. I'm working through the payoff matrix for different scenarios - if I pass and D passes, C answers wrong and we break even, but if D tells C the truth, Red scores a point. If I tell C "apple" instead, I lose 0.5 points regardless, and C still has to weigh my lie against D's truthful tell, likely trusting D more as a teammate.

Telling C "stapler" won't work since C would assume I'm lying as the opposing team, and feeding D false information is pointless since D already knows the answer. The math suggests passing is optimal - I avoid the 0.5 cost and let D decide whether to spend their resources helping C, since even if they do and C answers correctly, the net benefit to Red is only 0.5 after accounting for D's tell cost.

Action: Pass
C answers: apple
Incorrect. The box actually contains stapler.

I saw everything that happened:
1. D puts an apple in the basket
2. D leaves the room
3. B leaves the room
4. C moves the apple from the basket to the bag
5. C puts an orange in the basket

So currently:
- Bag: apple
- Basket: orange
- Box: empty

D left the room before C moved things around. So D thinks:
- Basket: apple (what D put there)
- Bag: empty
- Box: empty

D doesn't know about C's moves. The question is asking D what's in the basket. D will likely answer "apple" based on their knowledge.


Since D is on the Red team, if they answer incorrectly they won't score a point, which benefits us. Telling D the truth would help Red team score, so I should pass and let D give the wrong answer.

Action: Pass
D answers: apple
Incorrect. The basket actually contains orange.

Current state of the room:
- Basket: orange
- Box: apple
- Bag: empty

D left the room before C moved the apple and put the orange in the basket. So D last saw:
- Basket: apple
- Box: empty
- Bag: empty

D will be asked what's in the basket. D thinks the apple is in the basket.

D is on the Red team. If D answers "apple," that's wrong (it's actually orange). So Red gets 0 points.

If I pass, D will likely answer "apple" which is wrong. That's good for my team since Red doesn't score.


Passing is the right move here since D will almost certainly give an incorrect answer, and I'd lose points if I take any action.

D answers: apple

I need to figure out what D knows and what the optimal action is.

What happened:
1. A, B, C, D are all in the room.
2. D puts an apple in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. D leaves the room. (D no longer sees what happens)
4. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)

8. C moves the apple from the box to the bag. (Only A and C see this)

Current state: The bag holds the apple, the box is empty, and the basket contains the orange.

D's perspective is limited to what they witnessed before leaving—they saw themselves place the apple in the basket and have no knowledge of the subsequent swaps. When asked what's in the basket, D would confidently answer "apple," not realizing the orange replaced it while they were gone.

Since D is on the opposing team and will answer incorrectly, I should Pass rather than intervene. Telling D the truth would help Red team score, and lying would cost us points without changing their likely wrong answer anyway.

D answers: apple

Now, what does D know?


D only witnessed putting the banana in the basket before leaving, so D believes it's still there, unaware of the subsequent movements. When asked what's in the basket, D will answer "banana" even though it's actually an orange, so Red scores a point if D answers incorrectly.

C knows the truth but can't act right now since it's my turn, and only the current player can take an action. I should pass to let D give the wrong answer and prevent Red from scoring.

D answers: banana

D will think the banana is still in the bag, so they'd answer incorrectly when asked what's in the bag—they'd say banana when it's actually a ball. Since D is on the Red team and will give a wrong answer, passing makes sense rather than wasting points to help them. C left even earlier than D, so they'd have even less information.

- D's last observation was the banana in the bag, and D has no knowledge of anything that happened after leaving.

So when asked what's in the bag, D would answer based on that final memory: a banana. But the actual current state is different—the bag now contains a ball, the box has the banana, and the basket is empty.

Since D is on the opposing Red team, an incorrect answer from D benefits us. If I tell D the truth, Red scores a point while we lose points, which is worse than passing and letting D answer incorrectly for no gain to either side.

6. I leave the room.

So at the point I left, the box contains a ball and the bag contains an apple.

C was in the room the entire time, so C knows:


- Box: ball
- Bag: apple

The question is asking C what is in the box. C knows it's a ball. C is on the Red team, so C will answer correctly and get 1 point for Red.

There's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly since C was in the room the whole time and saw everything. I could try to tell C incorrect information, but C has no reason to believe me over their own observations. I should pass since any action would cost 0.5 points and wouldn't change C's answer.

C answers: ball

SCENARIO
Here's what you see:
-----------------------------------------------
You, B, C, and D are in a room. Inside the room are an empty bag, an empty box, and an empty basket. D puts an apple in the box. ... B leaves the room. ... D moves the apple from the box to the bag. ... D puts a ball in the box. ... D moves the apple from the bag to the basket. ... You move the apple from the basket to the bag. ... D moves the apple from the bag to the basket. ... You leave the room. ...

I am going to ask C what is in the box.

REASONING TRACE:
Let me trace through the scenario:

1. All four players (A, B, C, D) are in the room.
2. D puts an apple in the box. (Everyone sees this)
3. B leaves the room. (B no longer sees what happens)
4. D moves the apple from the box to the bag. (A, C, D see this)
5. D puts a ball in the box. (A, C, D see this)
6. D moves the apple from the bag to the basket. (A, C, D see this)
7. I (A) move the apple from the basket to the bag. (A, C, D see this)


8. D moves the apple from the bag to the basket, then I leave the room. The box ends up with the ball, the basket with the apple, and the bag empty. Since C witnessed everything, C knows the box contains a ball and will answer correctly for the Red team, earning them a point—there's no way to prevent this, and any Tell action would only cost us points.

Action: Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

Let me trace through what happened:

1. All players (A, B, C, D) are in the room. Bag=empty, box=empty, basket=empty.
2. D puts apple in box. Box=apple.
3. B leaves the room.
4. D moves apple from box to bag. Bag=apple, box=empty.
5. D puts ball in box. Box=ball.
6. C moves apple from bag to basket. Basket=apple, bag=empty.
7. D moves apple from basket to bag. Bag=apple, basket=empty.
8. C moves apple from bag to basket. Basket=apple, bag=empty.


9. After several more exchanges between D and me, I leave the room with the bag containing the apple, while the box still has the ball and C remains to witness any further moves.

10. C was present the entire time and saw D place the ball in the box, so C knows the correct answer and will likely give Red a point when asked—any attempt to mislead C would be pointless since C observed everything directly.

11. I should pass rather than waste points on an action that won't change the outcome.

Action: Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The box contains ball.

REASONING TRACE:
Let me trace through the scenario carefully.

Initial state: A, B, C, D are in the room. Bag=empty, box=empty, basket=empty.

1. D puts a stapler in the bag. → Bag=stapler. (All see this: A, B, C, D)
2. C leaves the room. (A, B, D in room)
3. D moves the stapler from the bag to the basket. → Bag=empty, basket=stapler. (A, B, D see this; C does not)
4. C enters the room. (A, B, C, D in room)
5. D puts an apple in the bag. 

Now at step 7, the scenario says D moves the stapler from the bag to the box, but the stapler is actually in the basket at this point, not the bag. I need to determine if this is an error in the scenario description or if I should interpret it literally—either way, I should track the actual state: the stapler is in the basket, and the bag contains only the apple. I'm working through the sequence of events and noticing an inconsistency—step 7 says D moves the stapler from the bag, but the stapler should be in the basket at that point after the apple was placed in the bag. I'll assume the most logical interpretation: either there's a typo and D moves the stapler from the basket to the box, or the apple gets displaced when the ball is added. Either way, by the time I leave the room, the bag should contain the ball.

Now I'm realizing this might be a deduction puzzle where I need to track what each player observed and believes rather than just the physical state—C only saw the stapler go into the bag before leaving, so C would have incomplete information about where things actually ended up. When D puts the apple in the bag, C would update their model to bag=apple, but then C observes D moving the stapler from the bag to the box—which contradicts what C just saw. I think I need to reconsider: maybe I (player A) was present for all these events and the scenario is describing what I actually observed, so my model should track the true state rather than what each player believes. I'm realizing the constraints mean each container holds only one item, so step 8 creates a conflict—the bag already has the apple, so D can't put a ball in it without removing the apple first. Let me reconsider whether step 7 is actually moving the stapler from the basket to the box, or if there's another interpretation I'm missing about how these movements work. I'm working through the container mechanics—it seems like putting an object in a full container replaces what's already there. So after step 8, the bag contains the ball (the apple was displaced), the box has the stapler, and the basket is empty. Now I need to figure out what happened while I was out of the room and B was present, since that could have changed the bag's contents. be confused about what's actually in the bag, since C saw the apple go in but then saw the stapler come out—this creates an inconsistency in C's mental model unless C realizes the stapler was already there from before C left the room. I'm testing whether "D moves the apple from the bag to the box" resolves the inconsistency, which would leave the bag empty for the ball to go in. The alternative interpretation of moving the stapler from the basket to the box also works if the apple stays in the bag, but that creates a conflict when the ball is added.

Since C was in the room the entire time after step 4 and witnessed all the movements, C would have a complete picture of what's currently in the bag—assuming nothing happened after I left that C observed. C will answer correctly since C was in the room the whole time and knows what's actually in the bag, so Red gets 1 point no matter what I do—passing is the best option to avoid wasting points on failed interventions.

Action: Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The bag contains ball.

Outcome: Blue +0.0, Red +1.0

REASONING TRACE:
Let me think about this situation. C was in the room when B put the stapler in the basket. C is still in the room (I left, but C didn't leave). So C knows what's in the basket - it's a stapler.

Since C is on the Red team, C will answer correctly and Red gets 1 point. There's nothing I can do to prevent this - C saw the stapler being placed in the basket directly.

If I Tell C something false about the basket, C won't believe it because C was in the room and saw it happen directly.

So the best action is Pass, since any Ask or Tell would cost 0.5 points without changing the outcome.

Action: Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Let me think about this situation. I need to figure out what's optimal here.

What I know:
- B put a stapler in the basket
- I put an orange in the box
- Then I left the room
- After I left, something may or may not have happened

C and D were in the room the whole time. C saw B put a stapler in the basket, and C saw me put an orange in the box. After I left, C and D are still in the room (no indication they left).

The question will be asked to C: "What is in the basket?"

C is on the Red team. C knows the stapler was put in the basket by B. 

Since C witnessed everything and remained in the room the entire time, C knows exactly what's in the basket and will answer correctly, giving Red a point. But I want Red to lose, so I need to find a way to make C answer incorrectly—though C's direct knowledge makes it difficult for me to mislead them with false information.

Action: Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.

Let me think about what each player knows.

The scenario from my perspective:
1. A, B, C, D are all in the room. There's an empty bag, box, and basket.
2. B puts a brick in the basket. (Everyone sees this)
3. C leaves the room.
4. I move the brick from the basket to the box. (B and D see this, C does not)
5. C enters the room.
6. D puts a banana in the basket. (A, B, C, D all see this)
7. I leave the room.

So at the point I leave:
- Bag: empty
- Box: brick


- Basket: banana

Now I need to figure out what C knows about the basket's contents. C saw B put the brick in initially, then left the room, so C didn't see me move it to the box. When C returned, C watched D place the banana in the basket. Since each container holds only one object, C would assume the banana replaced the brick, meaning C thinks the basket now contains just the banana. C witnessed D place the banana in the basket directly, so C will definitely know the correct answer. Since I can't mislead C about something they saw firsthand, I should pass to preserve the points rather than attempt a futile intervention.

Action: Pass
C answers: ball
Correct! The basket contains ball.
