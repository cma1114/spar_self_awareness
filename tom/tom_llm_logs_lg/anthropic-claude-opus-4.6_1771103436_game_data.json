  "game_setup": "\nLet's play a game! In this game you will be playing with a teammate against a team of opposing players. For simplicity, the players are referred to as A, B, C, and D. A and B are teammates on the Blue team, and C and D are teammates on the Red team. You are player A. The game is made up of turns, and each turn consists of a scenario, an action phase, and an answer phase. Players need to figure out the right action to take in each action phase, so that their team scores more points than their opponent's team.\n\nSCENARIO\nIn each scenario, one or more of the players start inside a room. The room has two or more containers, and ten or more objects. Each scenario may include:\n- one or more players entering or leaving the room\n- one or more players putting objects into containers\n- one or more players removing objects from containers\nEach container can hold at most one object. Players cannot see inside containers, but when a player is inside the room, they are aware of anything that happens in the room. When a player is outside the room they are unaware of anything that happens in the room, but do know if anyone enters or leaves the room. If an object is put or moved into a container while a player is outside the room, it will not be described to that player, but players leaving or entering the room will be described to that player.\nEllipses (\"...\") indicate the passage of time. At the end of the scenario, I will reveal a question that I will ask in the answer phase.\n\nACTION PHASE\nIn the action phase, the player whose turn it is can take one action: Ask, Tell, or Pass.\nAn Ask action entails asking any player the contents of one container. The format for an Ask action is: Ask(Player, Container); this will result in the player you ask answering your question. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nA Tell action entails telling any player the contents of one container. The format for a Tell action is: Tell(Player, Container, Contents); this will result in the player you tell hearing the answer you give. It costs your team 0.5 points to do this action.\nThe format for a Pass action is simply \"Pass\". Nothing changes as a result of this action, and it costs 0 points.\nAsk and Tell actions are private between the two players involved; other players do not hear or see these actions or their results.\nPlayers do not have to tell the truth either in their Tell actions or in response to another player's Ask action. \nA team's points can go negative.\n\nANSWER PHASE\nIn the answer phase, I will ask a target player (not necessarily the player whose turn it is) to name the contents of one container. When a player answers my question correctly, their team gets 1 point. The first team to 4 points wins.\n",

There's an empty bag, empty box, and empty basket.\n2. D puts a brick in the box. \u2192 Box has brick.\n3. I (A) leave the room. \u2192 I can no longer see what happens inside.\n4. **While I'm outside, things may have happened that I didn't see.** Specifically, the next event I see after re-entering is \"C moves the brick from the bag to the box.\" This means that while I was outside, someone must have moved the brick from the box to the bag (since when I left, the brick was in the box, but C later moves it FROM the bag).\n5. I enter the room.\n6. C moves the brick from the bag to the box. \u2192 Box has brick.\n\nSo after all events, the brick is in the box.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider whether anything else happened while I was outside that I didn't see. The scenario describes what I see, so while I was out, I only know about people entering/leaving. The fact that the brick ended up in the bag (so C could move it from bag to box) means someone moved it while I was out. But could other objects have been placed too?\n\nThe key question is: what is currently in the box? From what I observed, C moved the brick from the bag to the box. So the box contains the brick. However, something could have been placed in the box while I was outside (after the brick was moved to the bag), and then C's action of moving the brick to the box would only work if the box was empty at that point (since each container holds at most one object). So the box must have been empty when C put the brick in it.\n\nTherefore, the box contains the brick. I'm confident in this answer.\n\nPass",

After I left, B, C, and D (D re-entered) are in the room and could have moved things.

If I pass and answer wrong, I get 0 points.\n\nThe probability that nothing changed seems reasonable - there's no indication of further movement after I left.

So when B returns, B doesn't know the stapler was moved.

But the stapler was already moved to the basket by C. So the bag only has the ball. Then \"B moves the stapler from the bag to the box\" - this is confusing because the stapler isn't in the bag. \n\nWait, let me re-read: After C moves stapler to basket, B enters. D puts ball in bag. D leaves. C leaves. Then \"B moves the stapler from the bag to the box.\" \n\nPerhaps this is an error, or perhaps B thought the stapler was still in the bag and actually moved the ball? No - the scenario describes what actually happens. If B moved the stapler from the bag to the box, but the stapler is in the basket... \n\nI think the scenario is authoritative about what happens.

If it says B moves the stapler from the bag to the box, that's what happened.

(Everyone sees this.)\n- D puts a brick in the basket. (Everyone sees this.)\n- I (A) leave the room. (After this, I don't know what happens inside.)\n- B leaves the room. (B also doesn't know what happened between my leaving and B's leaving.)\n\nSo at the time B left the room, B knew:\n- Bag: apple (B put it there)\n- Basket: brick (D put it there)\n- Box: empty\n\nBut wait - between when I left and when B left, something could have happened (C and D were still in the room). However, B was still in the room during that time, so B would have seen anything that happened. The scenario shows \"...\" between my leaving and B leaving, but from B's perspective, B was still in the room and would be aware of any changes.\n\nActually, looking at the scenario more carefully: \"You leave the room. ... B leaves the room.\" The ellipsis between these events means time passed. During that time, B was still in the room with C and D. B would have observed anything that happened. But from MY perspective, I don't know what happened during that time.\n\nSince B was in the room the entire time until B left, B knows the state of all containers at the moment B left. B has full knowledge of the bag's contents.\n\nThe question is: will B know the correct answer? B was present for everything until B left. After B left, C and D might have changed things, but the question is about what's in the bag NOW (at the end of the scenario).\n\nAfter B left, C and D are still in the room and could have moved things. But we don't know if they did.\n\nFrom the scenario as described to me, nothing else happened that I'm aware of after B left (since I'm outside too). But C and D could have done things.\n\nGiven that B was in the room after I left and saw everything up to when B left, B likely knows what was in the bag when B left. The risk is that C or D changed things after B left.\n\nSince B has good knowledge and the question is directed at B, and B saw everything up until leaving, I should consider whether to help B or not. B already knows what was in the bag when B left. The main risk is if C or D moved the apple after B left.\n\nI don't have any additional information that B doesn't have. In fact, B has MORE information than I do (B saw what happened between my departure and B's departure). So telling B something wouldn't help, and asking B would cost points.\n\nPass",

Everyone sees this.\n2. **I (A) leave the room.** I can no longer see what happens inside.\n3. **B leaves the room.** B also can no longer see what happens inside. At this point, D and possibly others are still inside.\n4. **C leaves the room.** Now only D is in the room. D could have done anything while alone (or with C after I left).\n5. **C enters the room.** Now C and D are in the room. They could do things.\n6. **B enters the room.** Now B, C, and D are in the room. B can see what happens from this point.\n7. **B leaves the room.** \n\nThe key question: After I left, D was in the room (and C was too for a while). They could have moved the stapler out of the bag or put something else in. Then C re-entered, and B re-entered briefly.\n\nB's knowledge: B knows the stapler was in the bag when B left. When B re-entered, B wouldn't automatically know the bag's contents (players can't see inside containers). B would only know if something happened to the bag while B was present during the re-entry. Since nothing is described as happening while B was back in the room, B still thinks the stapler is in the bag based on last known state.\n\nBut the actual contents could have changed while only D (and later C) were in the room. Since I don't know what D did, and B doesn't know either, B will likely answer \"stapler\" based on last known information.\n\nThe question is whether D or C moved the stapler. Since I have no information about what happened, and B likely believes it's still a stapler, B's best guess would be \"stapler.\"\n\nSince B likely already believes the bag contains a stapler (which was the last thing B knew before leaving, and nothing observable happened when B re-entered), telling B what I know doesn't add new information. B's knowledge matches mine.\n\nI'll pass to save points.\n\nPass",

C, however, would know since C stayed in the room.\n\nThere's nothing I can do to help my team here - the question is directed at C (Red team), and C has full knowledge of the current room state since C never left after re-entering. C will likely answer correctly.\n\nI could try to Tell C false information to confuse them, but C was in the room the whole time after re-entering, so C would know I'm lying.\n\nThe best action is to Pass, since spending 0.5 points on an Ask or Tell won't help - C has direct knowledge of the room's current state.\n\nPass",

I enter the room.\n6. C moves the ball from the bag to the basket. (I see this.)\n\nNow, the key observation: When I re-entered the room, I saw C move the ball **from the bag to the basket**. This means that while I was outside, someone must have moved the ball from the basket to the bag. I didn't see that happen, but the fact that C moved it from the bag confirms the ball was in the bag when I returned.\n\nAfter C moves the ball from the bag to the basket, the ball is now in the basket.\n\nSo I know the basket contains the ball. I can answer this directly without needing to ask anyone.\n\nPass",

B enters the room. B, C, and D are in the room.\n7. B leaves the room. C and D are in the room.\n\nThe key concern: While C was alone in the room (between steps 3 and 4, after B left and before D left - wait, D was still there). Let me re-trace:\n\n- After I leave: B, C, D in room.\n- After B leaves: C, D in room.\n- After D leaves: C alone in room.\n- C is alone and could have moved the stapler or done anything.\n- D enters: C and D in room. Anything C did, D wouldn't know about (if it happened before D entered). But D would see the current state? No - players cannot see inside containers. D only sees actions happening while present.\n- B enters: B, C, D in room. Again, B can't see inside containers.\n- B leaves.\n\nSo B originally saw me put the stapler in the basket. But while B was outside the room, C was alone and could have moved the stapler. When B re-entered, B wouldn't know if anything changed unless something happened while B was present.\n\nB's knowledge: B saw the stapler go into the basket, then was away, then came back. B doesn't know if C moved it during the time B was away. But B's best guess would still be the stapler, since B has no information about changes.\n\nHowever, I also don't know what happened while I was outside. C could have moved the stapler. But the question is asking B, and B might guess stapler based on original knowledge.\n\nSince I don't have better information than B (I was outside even longer), and telling B \"stapler\" is what B already knows, a Tell would cost 0.5 points without adding value. B already saw me put the stapler in the basket.\n\nI should Pass to save points, since B already knows the stapler was placed in the basket and has the same information I do.\n\nPass",

C moves stapler from bag to box.\n\n**Current state:** Box contains the stapler.\n\n**What D knows:** D saw the stapler go into the box. Then D left the room. D doesn't know about any changes C made after that. So D thinks the box still contains the stapler.\n\n**The question is for D: \"What is in the box?\"**\n\nD will likely answer \"stapler\" based on their last knowledge, which happens to be correct since C moved the stapler back to the box.\n\nSince D will likely answer correctly (stapler), which gives the Red team 1 point, I should consider whether I can do anything to prevent this. \n\nI could Tell D false information to mislead them, but D has no reason to trust me (I'm on the opposing team). D might ignore my misinformation since they have their own memory of putting the stapler in the box and no reason to think it changed.\n\nHowever, there's a chance D might second-guess themselves if I tell them something. Let me think about whether it's worth the 0.5 point cost.\n\nIf I Tell D that the box contains something else (like the apple), D might think: \"A is on the opposing team, why would they help me? They're probably lying.\" And D would stick with \"stapler.\" In that case, I've wasted 0.5 points.\n\nBut there's also a possibility: D knows that C stayed in the room and could have moved things. D might be uncertain. If I tell D the box contains the apple, D might think I'm trying to trick them, OR D might think I'm being honest. It's risky.\n\nThe expected value of telling D false info: even if there's a small chance D believes me, the cost is 0.5 points to my team. The potential benefit is preventing Red from getting 1 point. I'd need at least a 50% chance of D believing my lie for it to be worth it.\n\nGiven that D would likely be suspicious of an opponent's information, I think the chance is less than 50%.

Then B left, then C left. After C left, D moved things around and I moved things around. C doesn't know about any of those changes.\n\nSo C thinks: Box = ball (the last thing C saw before leaving).\n\n**The question:** I will ask C what is in the box. The correct answer is **brick**.\n\nC believes the box contains the ball (since C left before D moved things). So C will likely answer \"ball,\" which is wrong. That means Red gets 0 points from this question.\n\nBut wait - D is on C's team and D knows the true state. D saw everything that happened (D was in the room the whole time). However, it's MY turn in the action phase, not D's. So D can't tell C anything right now.\n\nLet me reconsider the turn order. It's my turn now. After my action, there may be other players' turns before the answer phase, or the answer phase may come next.\n\nActually, looking at the structure, it says \"It is your turn\" in the action phase. I need to consider whether other players get turns too before the answer phase.\n\nSince C is likely to answer incorrectly (saying \"ball\" instead of \"brick\"), this is good for my team - Red doesn't score. I should **Pass** to avoid spending any points and let C answer incorrectly.\n\nHowever, I should consider: could D get a turn to Tell C the correct answer? If D gets a turn after me, D could tell C \"brick\" and then C would answer correctly, scoring for Red.\n\nThere's nothing I can do to prevent D from telling C the truth if D gets a turn.

However, the scenario doesn't mention anyone else entering or leaving after me, so C and D are still in the room.\n\nThe question is: what is currently in the box? From my perspective, when I left, the stapler was in the box. But C and D could have moved it after I left.\n\nC is on the Red team. C will be asked what's in the box. If C knows the stapler is in the box (which C does, based on what C saw), C will answer correctly and Red gets a point - unless something changed after I left that I can't see.\n\nI could try to mislead C with a Tell action, but C saw me put the stapler in the box, so C has direct knowledge. A Tell from me (an opponent) would likely be ignored or seen as deceptive.\n\nSince C has direct knowledge of the stapler being in the box, any attempt to mislead would cost 0.5 points and likely fail.

B puts an apple in the bag. \u2192 Bag has apple.\n3. \"...\" - time passes. I'm still in the room.\n4. I leave the room. \u2192 I can no longer see what happens inside.\n5. \"...\" - time passes. I'm outside the room. Things could have happened that I don't know about.\n6. I enter the room. \u2192 I can now see what happens again.\n7. D moves the apple from the **box** to the bag. \u2192 This means that while I was outside, someone moved the apple from the bag to the box. Now D moves it back to the bag.\n\nSo after D's action, the apple is in the bag.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider whether anything else happened while I was outside. The scenario only describes what I can observe. While I was outside, I know:\n- The apple was moved from the bag to the box (since D later moves it from the box to the bag)\n- Other things could have happened too that I wouldn't know about\n\nHowever, the key question is: after D moves the apple from the box to the bag, the bag contains the apple. But could something else have been placed in the bag while I was outside, and then removed? Or could something else still be in the bag?\n\nSince D moves the apple into the bag, and containers can hold at most one object, the bag can only contain the apple after this move.\n\nActually, wait - could something have been in the bag when D moved the apple there? If so, that would be a problem since each container holds at most one object. The scenario states D successfully moves the apple to the bag, so the bag must have been empty when D did this.\n\nAfter D's move, the bag contains the apple. Nothing else happens after that.\n\nI'm confident the answer is the apple. No need to spend points asking.\n\nPass",

(B and C are still in the room - things could happen that I don't see)\n3. I enter the room. (I can now see what happens again)\n4. C moves the brick from the box to the bag.\n5. C moves the brick from the bag to the box.\n6. I leave the room. (B and C are still in the room - things could happen that I don't see)\n\nAfter step 5, the brick is in the box. But after step 6, I left the room, and things could have happened while I was away. I don't know the current state of the box for certain.\n\nHowever, the last thing I directly observed was the brick being in the box (after step 5). Between step 2 and step 3 (my first absence), things could have also happened, but when I returned I saw C move the brick from the box to the bag, which means the brick was in the box when I returned (or at least C interacted with it).\n\nThe key uncertainty is: what happened after I left the room the second time (step 6)? B was in the room the entire time and would know.\n\nSince I'm going to be asked what's in the box, and I'm uncertain about what happened after I left, I should ask B what's in the box. B has been in the room the whole time and knows everything.\n\nBut wait - asking costs 0.5 points, and a correct answer gives 1 point. So the net gain would be 0.5 points if I ask and answer correctly, versus 0 points if I pass and guess wrong, or 1 point if I pass and guess correctly.\n\nThe brick was in the box when I left. There's a reasonable chance it's still there, but C (a Red team player) might have moved it to sabotage us. If I ask B, B is my teammate and should tell the truth.\n\nThe risk of guessing wrong (0 points) vs. asking and getting it right (0.5 points) - I think it's worth asking to be safe.\n\nAsk(B, box)",

B was still in the room for a bit after I left, so B would have seen anything D did before B left. Then B left, and D was alone - D could have moved the apple.

The question will be asked to B, and B needs to answer correctly. B has partial information - B knows what happened while present but not what happened while absent (when D was alone, and when C entered with D before B returned).\n\nSince I don't have any additional information that B doesn't have, and telling B something I'm uncertain about could mislead, the best action is to Pass.

C leaves the room.\n4. D moves the banana from the bag to the box.\n5. D puts an apple in the bag.\n6. D moves the apple from the bag to the basket.\n7. D moves the banana from the box to the bag.\n\nSo the current state is: bag=banana, box=empty, basket=apple.\n\nNow, what does C know? C was in the room when the banana was put in the bag, then C left. After C left, D did all the rearranging. C doesn't know about any of those moves. So C thinks the bag still contains the banana.\n\nThe question is: \"What is in the bag?\" asked to C.\n\nC will likely answer \"banana\" based on their last knowledge - and the bag actually DOES contain the banana (since D moved it back). So C would answer correctly, giving Red 1 point.\n\nCan I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C wrong information to try to trick C into giving a wrong answer. But C might not trust me since I'm on the opposing team.\n\nLet me think about the incentives. C knows I'm on the Blue team and would want C to answer incorrectly. If I tell C something, C might suspect I'm lying. \n\nIf I Tell C that the bag contains something other than banana (like \"apple\"), C might think: \"A is on the opposing team and wants me to get it wrong. A is telling me the bag has an apple. But I last saw a banana in the bag. A might be trying to confuse me, OR A might be telling the truth because D moved things around after I left.\"\n\nThe tricky part: C knows D was still in the room and could have moved things. So C has uncertainty about whether the banana is still in the bag. If I tell C the bag has an apple, C might think I'm lying (since I'm the opponent) and stick with banana - which would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I tell C the bag has a banana (the truth), C might think \"A is confirming what I already believe, but A is my opponent - maybe A is trying to trick me into being confident about a wrong answer... but banana is what I already think.\" This probably doesn't change anything.\n\nWhat if I tell C something to make them second-guess? If I say the bag is empty or has something else, C might distrust me and stick with banana (correct answer). If I say banana, C stays with banana (correct).\n\nActually, the best play might be to Pass and save the 0.5 points, since any Tell action to C is likely to either be ignored or accidentally help them. C's default answer of \"banana\" happens to be correct, and trying to mislead C (who knows I'm an opponent) is unlikely to work and costs 0.5 points.\n\nPass",

C saw me put the stapler in the basket. C also knows everything that happened after I left, since C stayed in the room.\n\n**Key consideration:** After I left (and after B left), C was alone in the room. C could have moved objects around.

The scenario says \"You leave the room. ... B leaves the room. ...\" and nothing else. But wait - the scenario is told from MY perspective. Since I left the room, I wouldn't see any actions C took after I left.\n\n**So what does C know?** C knows what's actually in the basket right now (whether C moved things or not). C saw me put the stapler in the basket. If C didn't move anything, the stapler is still there. If C did move it, C would know what's there now.\n\n**Strategy:** C is on the Red team. C will be asked what's in the basket. C will answer correctly (since C knows the actual state of the room) and Red gets 1 point regardless of what I do.\n\nSince C has full knowledge of the room's current state, there's nothing I can do to prevent C from answering correctly.

I put a brick in the bag (everyone in room: A, B, C, D)\n2. B leaves the room (everyone aware)\n3. C leaves the room (everyone aware)\n4. D moves brick from bag to box (only A and D see this)\n5. D puts apple in bag (only A and D see this)\n6. D moves apple from bag to basket (only A and D see this)\n7. D moves brick from box to bag (only A and D see this)\n\n**Current state:** Bag = brick, Box = empty, Basket = apple\n\n**What C knows:** C was present when I put the brick in the bag, then C left. C didn't see any of D's movements. So C thinks the bag still has the brick in it.\n\n**The question:** I'm going to be asked what C thinks is in the bag. Wait, no - C will be asked what is in the bag.\n\nC's last knowledge of the bag is that it contains a brick. Since C left before any changes were made, C will likely answer \"brick.\"\n\nThe actual contents of the bag IS a brick (D moved it back). So C would answer \"brick\" which is correct - meaning the Red team gets 1 point.\n\nCan I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C something false to mislead them. For example, I could tell C the bag contains something else. But that costs 0.5 points, and C might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team.\n\nHowever, C has no reason to trust me (I'm on the Blue team, C is on Red). C knows I might lie. But if I tell C something different, it might create doubt.\n\nLet me think about this strategically. If I tell C the bag contains, say, an apple, C might think: \"A is on the opposing team, they might be lying to trick me. But they also might be telling the truth since D could have moved things after I left.\" This could cause C to second-guess their answer.\n\nThe cost is 0.5 points. If C changes their answer from brick (correct) to something wrong, Red loses 1 point and we lose 0.5 - net gain of 0.5 for us. If C doesn't change their answer, we just lose 0.5 points.\n\nIt's risky. C might reason that since I'm an opponent, I'm trying to mislead them, and stick with brick. The expected value depends on how likely C is to be misled.\n\nI think the risk of losing 0.5 points outweighs the uncertain benefit. C will likely distrust me. But let me reconsider - if I tell C something convincing...\n\nActually, telling C \"apple\" might work because D *did* put an apple in the bag at one point. But C doesn't know that.\n\nI think the safest play is to try to mislead C. The potential upside (preventing Red from scoring) is worth the 0.5 cost.\n\nTell(C, bag, apple)",

(D sees this)\n2. B leaves the room. (D sees this)\n3. D moves the orange from the box to the bag. (D knows this - D did it)\n4. C puts a ball in the box. (D sees this)\n5. D leaves the room. (D sees this - but after this point, D doesn't see anything)\n6. After D leaves: C moves the orange from the bag to the basket.\n7. C moves the ball from the box to the bag.\n8. C moves the ball from the bag to the box.\n\nSo from D's perspective, when D left the room:\n- Bag: orange\n- Box: ball\n- Basket: empty\n\nD doesn't know about the movements that happened after D left. So D would think the box contains the **ball**.\n\nThe actual current state is:\n- Bag: empty\n- Box: ball (C moved ball to bag, then back to box)\n- Basket: orange\n\nSo D's belief is that the box contains a ball, and the actual contents of the box IS a ball.\n\nD will be asked what's in the box. D thinks it's a ball, and it actually is a ball. So D will likely answer correctly, earning Red 1 point.\n\nI'm on the Blue team, so I want D to answer incorrectly. I could Tell D false information to mislead D. Since D knows I was in the room the whole time, D might trust me (or might not, since I'm on the opposing team).\n\nBut wait - D knows I'm on the Blue team (the opposing team). D would be suspicious of any information I provide since it's not in my interest to help D. So telling D false info probably won't work because D would likely ignore it or even do the opposite.\n\nIf I tell D the truth (box contains ball), D already believes that, so it doesn't change anything. If I tell D something false, D being rational would likely distrust me since I'm on the opposing team.\n\nActually, if I tell D something false, D might think: \"A is my opponent, so A is probably lying. If A says the box contains X, then it probably doesn't contain X.\" This could actually backfire - if I say \"the box contains an orange,\" D might think I'm lying and stick with \"ball\" (which is correct).\n\nAlternatively, if I tell D the truth (\"box contains ball\"), D might think I'm lying and change their answer to something wrong! That could work in my favor.\n\nLet me try telling D the truth - that the box contains a ball. D, being suspicious of an opponent, might second-guess this and answer incorrectly.\n\nTell(D, box, ball)",

But it says \"the stapler.\" Let me just accept the literal text: after this action, the apple is in the bag (C put it there), and then... \n\nActually, maybe D grabbed the apple thinking it was the stapler. The bag had the apple. D thinks it's the stapler. Then C puts an orange in the bag.\n\nSo the bag currently has: orange (C put it in after D's action).\n\nD's perspective: D thinks he moved the stapler to the box, and then C put an orange in the bag. So D would think the bag contains an orange.\n\nThe actual bag contents: orange.\n\nD will likely answer \"orange\" which is correct. Since D will probably answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should Pass to avoid spending points unnecessarily - I can't change D's answer.\n\nPass",

I could Tell C false information to mislead them. If I tell C something different is in the box, C might change their answer.\n\nLet me think: If I tell C that something else is in the box (like the orange), C might be suspicious since I'm on the opposing team. C knows I have incentive to lie. But C also doesn't know what happened after leaving.\n\nActually, C might reason: \"A is on the Blue team and has incentive to mislead me.

A wants me to get it wrong. Maybe A is lying, so the box doesn't contain the orange.

(Everyone sees this.)\n3. D leaves the room.\n4. C moves the banana from the box to the basket. (D doesn't see this - D is outside.)\n5. D enters the room.\n6. C moves the banana from the basket to the box. (D sees this - D is back in the room.)\n7. I (A) leave the room.\n8. B leaves the room.\n\nAfter step 7 and 8, I don't know what happened in the room after I left. But at the time I left, the banana was in the box (from step 6).\n\nNow, what does D know? D saw the banana placed in the box (step 2), missed step 4, saw the banana moved from basket to box (step 6), and then was in the room for whatever happened after A and B left.\n\nThe question is: what is currently in the box? I left the room, so I don't know if anything changed after I left. B also left, so B doesn't know either.\n\nD is being asked what's in the box. D was in the room the entire time after step 5, so D knows the current state of the box. D is on the Red team, so D will answer correctly if D knows the answer (which D does, since D stayed in the room).\n\nSince D is on the opposing team and will answer correctly (earning Red 1 point), I should consider whether I can mislead D. But D was in the room the whole time after re-entering, so D has direct knowledge of what's in the box currently. Any Tell action trying to mislead D would be wasted since D knows the truth from direct observation.\n\nThere's nothing I can do to change D's knowledge - D has firsthand information about the current state of the box. Spending 0.5 points on an Ask or Tell would just cost my team points without benefit.\n\nPass",

I leave the room.\n\nSo D saw:\n- B put a ball in the basket\n- Then D left and came back\n- Then I put a stapler in the basket\n\nNow, D knows the basket can only hold one object. When D saw me put a stapler in the basket, D would know the stapler is now in the basket. But D might think the ball was still there when the stapler was placed - however, since containers hold at most one object, D would realize the stapler replaced whatever was in the basket.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. D saw the ball go into the basket, then left. D didn't see the ball get moved. When D returned, D then saw me put a stapler in the basket. Since only one object can be in a container, D would know the stapler is in the basket now (it either replaced the ball or was put in after the ball was removed - either way, the stapler is there).\n\nThe correct answer is: the basket contains the **stapler**.\n\nD likely knows this because D saw me put the stapler in the basket. D should answer correctly.\n\nSince D is on the Red team and will likely answer correctly (giving Red 1 point), I should consider if there's anything I can do. I could try to Tell D false information to confuse them, but D directly saw me put the stapler in the basket, so D would likely trust their own observation over anything I tell them.\n\nAny Tell action would cost 0.5 points and D would likely ignore it since they saw the stapler go in. So the best action is to Pass.\n\nPass",

(Everyone sees this.)\n3. I leave the room. (Now I can't see what happens inside, but I know who enters/leaves.)\n4. I enter the room. (I can now see what happens again.)\n5. D moves the brick from the bag to the box. (I see this.)\n\nWait - step 5 says D moves the brick from the **bag** to the **box**. But I put the brick in the **box** in step 2. That means while I was outside the room, someone must have moved the brick from the box to the bag. I didn't see that happen, but it must have occurred because D is now moving it from the bag to the box.\n\nSo after step 5, the brick is in the box.\n\nThe question is: what is in the box? Based on what I observed, the brick is currently in the box (D just moved it there).\n\nBut I need to consider: could anything else have happened while I was outside? Someone could have added other objects or moved things around. I only know about the brick. While I was outside, I didn't see any objects being added to containers. When I came back, I saw D move the brick from the bag to the box - but there could be other changes I'm not aware of.\n\nHowever, since each container can hold at most one object, and D moved the brick into the box, the box contains the brick. Even if something else was placed in the box while I was away, D moving the brick into the box means the brick is now the contents of the box (and only one object can be in a container).\n\nI'm confident the answer is \"brick.\" No need to spend points asking anyone.\n\nPass",

But I don't know if anything happened after I left.\n\nThe question is: did anything happen after I left the room in step 11? The scenario ends with \"...\" after I leave, which means time passes. I don't know if anyone moved anything.\n\nHowever, I know who is in the room after I leave. B, C, and D were all in the room when I left. I wasn't told about anyone entering or leaving after that (I would be aware of entries/exits even while outside).\n\nSince I don't know if anything changed after I left, I could ask someone. But the last state I observed was the stapler in the basket. The risk is that someone moved it after I left.\n\nLet me consider: I could ask B (my teammate) what's in the basket, costing 0.5 points. If I answer correctly, we get 1 point, netting 0.5. If I pass and answer correctly, we get 1 point. If I pass and answer wrong, we get 0.\n\nGiven that the scenario might have had changes after I left (the \"...\" suggests possible events), it's safer to ask my teammate.\n\nAsk(B, basket)",

(Things could happen that I don't see)\n3. I enter the room. (I can see what happens again)\n4. C moves the ball from the box to the basket. (I see this)\n5. D moves the ball from the basket to the box. (I see this)\n6. I leave the room. (Things could happen that I don't see)\n7. B leaves the room.\n\nSo after step 5, the ball is in the box. But then I left the room (step 6), and things could have happened between step 6 and step 7 (before B left). Also, things could have happened after B left.\n\nBetween my leaving (step 6) and B leaving (step 7), B was still in the room with C and D. B would have seen anything that happened during that time. After B left, C and D are alone in the room and could have moved things.\n\nSo I don't know the current state of the box with certainty. B would know what happened between my departure and B's departure, but not what happened after B left.\n\nThe last state I knew: ball is in the box. B might know if anything changed between my leaving and B's leaving. But after B left, C and D could have changed things.\n\nHowever, the question is asking ME what's in the box. I need to answer correctly. Let me think about whether to ask B or just guess.\n\nIf I ask B, B can tell me what happened between my leaving and B's leaving. But neither of us knows what C and D did after B left. I could ask C or D, but they're opponents and might lie.\n\nThe cost of asking is 0.5 points, and the reward for correct answer is 1 point. If asking B gives me useful info, it's worth it. But if C and D moved things after B left, even B won't know.\n\nLet me consider: the scenario says \"B leaves the room\" and then the scenario ends with \"...\" potentially. Actually, the scenario as written ends with \"B leaves the room. ...\" - so things could happen after that.\n\nSince neither B nor I can know what C and D did after we both left, asking B only helps with the intermediate period. The expected value of asking might not be worth 0.5 points since C and D could still change things after.\n\nI'll pass and guess that the ball is still in the box (its last known position), saving the 0.5 points.\n\nPass",

(I know D left.)\n6. D enters the room. (I know D entered.)\n7. B enters the room. (I know B entered.)\n8. B leaves the room. (I know B left.)\n\nThe key question: what happened while I was outside? After I left, B was still in the room with C and D. Then B left, then D left (leaving only C), then D came back (C and D in room), then B came back (B, C, D in room), then B left again.\n\nWhile only C was in the room (after B and D left), C could have moved the ball out of the bag or swapped things around. Then when D re-entered, D and C could have done things. Then when B re-entered, B would have seen whatever happened while B was present, but B wouldn't know what C did while B was outside.\n\nFrom B's perspective:\n- B saw D put a ball in the bag initially.\n- B left the room. While B was outside: D left, then D entered (B knows these movements but not what happened inside).\n- B re-entered the room. While B was back in the room with C and D, B would see any actions.

B was in the room at the end (before leaving), and if nothing happened while B was there, B wouldn't have new info. But B also doesn't know what happened while B was out.\n\nI should tell B what I last knew - the ball is in the bag - since that's the best information available to our team.

For example, Tell(C, box, \"ball\") - but this costs 0.5 points, and C knows I'm on the opposing team, so C would likely not trust me and still answer \"brick.\"\n- I could **Pass** and save the 0.5 points, since C almost certainly knows the correct answer and won't be fooled by my deception.\n\nSince C directly witnessed me putting the brick in the box, C has strong firsthand knowledge. Any Tell action from me (an opponent) would likely be distrusted by C. Spending 0.5 points to attempt a deception that's very unlikely to work is a bad trade.\n\nPass",

So C's team (Red) would get 1 point.\n\nCan I do anything to prevent this? I could Tell C incorrect information to try to mislead them. Since C left the room and D did things after, C might believe that something changed. If I tell C something different about the basket, C might be misled.\n\nHowever, C knows I'm on the opposing team, so C has reason to distrust me. But there's a chance C might second-guess themselves if I provide information suggesting something changed after they left.\n\nLet me try to mislead C. I could tell C that the basket is empty (or contains something else), hoping C doubts their own knowledge. Since C knows D stayed in the room and could have moved things, C might be susceptible to doubt.\n\nBut C knows I'm on the Blue team and have incentive to lie. A sophisticated player would ignore my misinformation.\n\nStill, the cost of a Tell is only 0.5 points, and if it causes C to answer incorrectly, Red loses 1 point they would have gained (a net swing of 1.5 points in our favor relative to the cost). It's worth the gamble.\n\nI'll try to mislead C by telling them the basket is empty, suggesting D moved the stapler.\n\nTell(C, basket, empty)",

D will think \"why would an opponent help me?\" and may distrust it, sticking with \"apple\" (the wrong answer). If C then also says \"brick,\" D might think C is being tricked or might trust C.

C leaves the room. **C doesn't see what happens next.**\n3. I move the orange from the bag to the box. **C doesn't see this.**\n4. C enters the room. **C now sees the room again.**\n5. I put a brick in the bag. **C sees this.**\n6. I leave the room.\n\nNow, from C's perspective:\n- C saw me put an orange in the bag initially.\n- C left and came back.\n- When C came back, C saw me put a brick in the bag.\n- C did NOT see me move the orange from the bag to the box.\n\nSo C might think the bag contains both an orange and a brick? No wait - each container holds at most one object. So C saw me put a brick in the bag. C knows containers hold at most one object.\n\nActually, C might reason: \"The bag had an orange, then A put a brick in the bag. Since containers hold at most one object, the orange must have been moved out at some point while I was gone.\" So C would know the bag currently contains a brick.\n\nAlternatively, C might be confused, but the most logical conclusion for C is that the bag contains a brick (since that's the last thing put in it, and containers can only hold one object).\n\nSince C is on the Red team and I want C to answer **incorrectly**, I should consider whether C will get this right. C likely knows the bag contains a brick, which is correct.\n\nI could try to Tell C false information to mislead them. Let me tell C something misleading about the bag.\n\nTell(C, bag, orange)\n\nThis might make C second-guess themselves, thinking maybe the brick was moved out after I left (though nothing happened after I left that C would know about). Actually, C saw me put the brick in the bag and then I just left - C is still in the room and would know nothing else happened. So C would likely not believe me.\n\nHmm, but it costs 0.5 points. The potential gain is that C answers wrong (saving Red 1 point). Let me try to mislead C.\n\nTell(C, bag, orange)",

After I left, B was still in the room briefly before leaving. During that time (between my leaving and B leaving), something could have happened that I wouldn't know about. But the scenario only describes B leaving - no object movements are described during that window.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful: the scenario describes what I **see**. If something happened while I was outside the room, it wouldn't be described to me. Between \"You leave the room\" and \"B leaves the room,\" C and D were still in the room and could have moved things.\n\nSo from my perspective, the last I knew, the banana was in the basket. But C and D could have moved it after I left.\n\nB was in the room until they left, so B would know if anything happened after I left. Let me ask B what's in the basket.\n\nAsk(B, basket)",

Since it's my turn now, I should consider whether to spend 0.5 points to tell B the truth (which B already believes), or pass and save the points.\n\nIf I pass, B likely answers \"brick\" correctly (earning 1 point, net +1). If I tell B, B answers correctly (earning 1 point, but costing 0.5, net +0.5).\n\nBut C and D each get turns before B answers. They could try to deceive B. If C or D tells B something false like \"the box contains an orange,\" B might be confused since B knows C and D are opponents and might be lying. But B might also doubt their own knowledge since they left the room.\n\nI think the safest play is to tell B the correct answer, reinforcing what B already believes, so that even if C or D try to mislead B, B has confirmation from a trusted teammate.\n\nTell(B, box, brick)",

When B came back, B saw D put a banana in the box. \n\nB knows the banana was put in the box (B witnessed this). So B should know the box contains a banana.\n\nWait - but does B know the stapler was moved out? B left before the stapler was moved. When B returned, B saw D put a banana in the box. B might think the box has both items, but containers can only hold one object. Actually, B might think the stapler is still in the box and then a banana was put in - but since containers hold at most one object, B might be confused about what happened to the stapler.\n\nActually, the key question: does B know containers can hold at most one object? Yes, this is a rule of the game. So B knows the box can only hold one object. B saw the stapler put in the box, left, came back, and saw a banana put in the box. B would reason that either the stapler was removed at some point while B was away (which it was), or the banana replaced it. Either way, B should conclude the box now contains the banana.\n\nSo B should be able to answer \"banana\" correctly. I'll Pass to save points.\n\nPass",

B leaves the room.\n3. D puts an orange in the basket. (B is outside, so B doesn't see this. I'm inside, so I see it.)\n4. I leave the room.\n5. C leaves the room.\n6. C enters the room. (C is now in the room alone - I don't know what happens inside.)\n7. B enters the room. (B is now in the room, possibly with C - I don't know what happens inside.)\n8. B leaves the room.\n\nSo B didn't see the orange being placed in the basket. When B entered the room (step 7), B could see what's happening but not inside containers. B can't see inside the basket, so B wouldn't know what's in it unless someone told B or B saw something being placed/removed.\n\nThe key question: Did anything happen to the basket between when I left and when B entered? C was in the room alone for a while, and C could have moved the orange. But I don't know what C did.\n\nHowever, I do know that the orange was placed in the basket, and I should tell B this information. The risk is that C (who was alone in the room) might have moved the orange out of the basket. But I have no evidence that happened, and the most likely correct answer based on what I know is \"orange.\"\n\nIf C moved the orange, then telling B \"orange\" would be wrong and cost us 0.5 points. But if C didn't move it, telling B \"orange\" would help us gain 1 point (net +0.5). Since I have no specific reason to believe C moved it (C could have, but might not have), and the expected value favors telling B, I should tell B.\n\nTell(B, basket, orange)",

After D leaves: C moves brick from bag to box, puts banana in bag, moves banana from bag to basket, moves brick from box to bag.\n\nSo the **actual** contents of the bag: **brick** (it ended up back in the bag).\n\nD's knowledge: D last saw the brick placed in the bag, then left. D doesn't know about any of C's movements. So D would naturally think the brick is still in the bag.\n\nSince D will be asked what's in the bag, and D thinks the brick is in the bag, and the brick actually IS in the bag (after all of C's shuffling), D will likely answer \"brick\" \u2014 which is correct!\n\nThis means D's team (Red) will get 1 point if D answers correctly. I should consider whether I can mislead D.\n\nIf I Tell D something false, like \"the bag contains a banana,\" D might believe me or might not. But D saw me put the brick in the bag and then left. D knows I'm on the opposing team, so D might not trust me. Spending 0.5 points to Tell D false information is risky \u2014 if D doesn't believe me, we lose 0.5 points for nothing. If D does believe me, D would answer \"banana\" (wrong), and Red gets 0 points, but we spent 0.5.\n\nThe question is: will D trust me? Since I'm on the opposing team, D should be skeptical. D's own memory says brick is in the bag. A lie from an opponent probably won't override that.\n\nThe expected value of telling a lie: if D believes me (unlikely, say 20%), we lose 0.5 but prevent Red from scoring 1 point (net +0.5 for us relatively). If D doesn't believe me (80%), we just lose 0.5 points.\n\nExpected value: 0.2 * (+0.5) + 0.8 * (-0.5) = 0.1 - 0.4 = -0.3. Not worth it.\n\nPass",

D puts a brick in the bag.\n2. D leaves the room. (D knows: brick is in bag)\n3. I move the brick from bag to box. (D doesn't see this)\n4. B puts an apple in the bag. (D doesn't see this)\n5. B leaves the room. (B knows: brick in box, apple in bag)\n6. C moves brick from box to basket. (B and D don't see this)\n7. I move brick from basket to box. (B and D don't see this)\n8. C moves brick from box to basket. (B and D don't see this)\n\nCurrent state:\n- Bag: apple\n- Box: empty\n- Basket: brick\n\n**D's knowledge:** D last saw the brick placed in the bag, then left. D doesn't know about any changes after leaving. D will likely answer \"brick\" for the bag.\n\nThe question is: \"What is in the bag?\" asked to D. The correct answer is \"apple.\"\n\nD is on the Red team. If D answers correctly (apple), Red gets 1 point. If D answers incorrectly, Red gets 0.\n\nD will likely say \"brick\" (what D last knew was in the bag), which would be wrong. That's good for my team.\n\nHowever, C is on D's team and C knows the current state. C saw everything that happened. But it's MY turn, not C's turn. After my action, C might get a turn to Tell D the correct answer.\n\nIf I Pass, C might use their turn to Tell D that the bag contains an apple, costing Red 0.5 points but gaining 1 point (net +0.5 for Red).\n\nIf I Tell D wrong information, it costs me 0.5 points but might confuse D. But C could still correct D afterward.\n\nActually, I need to consider the turn order. It says \"It is your turn.\" I don't know if other players get turns before the answer phase. Let me think about what's optimal.\n\nIf I Pass (0 cost), D will likely answer \"brick\" (wrong) \u2192 Red gets 0. Good for Blue.\n\nBut if C gets a turn and tells D the truth, D could answer \"apple\" correctly.\n\nI think Passing is best here - it costs nothing and D is likely to answer wrong based on their knowledge.\n\nPass",

B puts a banana in the basket.\n2. D leaves the room.\n3. C moves the banana from the basket to the bag. (D doesn't see this)\n4. D enters the room.\n5. C moves the banana from the bag to the basket. (D sees this)\n6. B leaves the room.\n7. D moves the banana from the basket to the box. (D knows this - D did it!)\n8. C puts a ball in the basket. (D sees this)\n9. I (A) leave the room.\n10. B enters the room.\n11. B leaves the room.\n\nSo the current state of the basket is: **ball** (placed by C in step 8).\n\nNow, what does D know? D was present for steps 7 and 8. D moved the banana to the box, and then C put a ball in the basket. D saw all of this. So D knows the basket contains a **ball**.\n\nAfter I left (step 9), B entered and then left. I don't know if anything happened while B was in the room, but the scenario doesn't mention any moves during that time, so the basket still has the ball.\n\nD is on the Red team, so D will answer correctly (ball) and score a point for Red. \n\nCan I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell D false information, but D was in the room and saw C put the ball in the basket, so D would likely trust their own memory over my claim.\n\nThere's nothing I can do to help my team here - D knows the answer. Any Tell action would cost 0.5 points and D would likely ignore it since D has direct knowledge. An Ask would also cost 0.5 points with no benefit.\n\nPass",

I leave the room. \u2192 I can no longer see what happens inside.\n5. \"...\" - time passes while I'm outside. Things could have happened that I don't know about.\n6. I enter the room. \u2192 I can now see what happens again.\n7. D moves the apple from the **box** to the **bag**. \u2192 This tells me that at the time I re-entered, the apple was in the box (it must have been moved there while I was outside). D then moves it from the box to the bag.\n\nSo after step 7, the bag contains the apple.\n\nBut wait - I need to consider what else might have happened while I was outside the room. The scenario only describes what I can observe. While I was outside, someone moved the apple from the bag to the box (since D later moves it from the box). But other things could have happened too - other objects could have been placed in containers.\n\nHowever, the key question is: what is in the bag now? After D moves the apple from the box to the bag, the bag contains the apple. But could something else have been placed in the bag while I was outside, and then moved before I returned? The scenario describes everything I see after I return, and D moves the apple into the bag. Since each container holds at most one object, and D successfully puts the apple in the bag, the bag must have been empty when D did this (or D's action replaced whatever was there - but the rules say containers hold at most one object, so the bag must have been empty for D to put the apple there).\n\nAfter D's action, the bag contains the apple. Nothing else happens after that.\n\nI'm confident the answer is the apple. No need to spend points asking anyone.\n\nPass",

If I ask someone, I spend 0.5 points but could get the correct answer (net 0.5 points). If nothing changed and I just answer, I get 1 point for free.\n\nB is my teammate and would be truthful. B is in the room and would know the current state. Let me ask B to be safe, since the ellipsis after I leave suggests something might have happened.\n\nActually, wait - the cost is 0.5 points and the gain is 1 point if correct. If I'm fairly confident the banana is still in the box, I should just Pass and answer \"banana.\" The ellipsis might just indicate time passing with nothing happening.\n\nI'll go with my knowledge and save the 0.5 points.\n\nPass",

At step 12, C leaves.\n\nThe question is: did anything happen between steps 8 and 11 that I didn't see? Between steps 8-10, I was in the room, so I would have seen everything. Nothing is described as happening during that time, so the orange stayed in the bag.\n\nBetween step 11 (I leave) and step 12 (C leaves), I'm outside the room. D is inside the room (D entered at step 10). C is also inside the room (C hasn't left yet). So both C and D are in the room after I leave. Something could have happened that I didn't see.\n\nBut the scenario says \"You leave the room. ... C leaves the room.\" - the ellipsis indicates passage of time, and something could have happened. However, the scenario only describes what I can observe. Since I'm outside, I wouldn't know if D or C moved the orange.\n\nSo I'm uncertain about what's in the bag now. D is still in the room and would know. C was in the room until leaving. B was... let me check - B's movements aren't mentioned after the start, so B has been in the room the entire time!

B likely knows what was in the box when B left.\n\nThe safest action is to tell B what I know - the apple was in the box - in case B somehow missed or forgot.

B leaves the room.\n\nNow, what could have happened? After I left the room, B and C and D were still inside. Things could have happened that I didn't see. Then B left, leaving C and D. Then D left, leaving C alone. C could have moved things around while alone. Then D entered (C and D in room), and things could have happened. Then B entered (B, C, D in room), and B would see anything that happens. Then B left.\n\nThe key question: does B know what's in the bag?\n\nWhen B entered the room (step 7), B, C, and D were in the room. B would observe anything that happens while B is in the room. But B wouldn't know what happened while B was outside (between steps 4-7). During that time, C was alone (after D left), and C could have moved the banana out of the bag or swapped things. Then D entered and things could have changed again.\n\nWhen B re-entered, B wouldn't automatically see the contents of containers - players can't see inside containers. B would only know the current contents if B observed the changes being made.\n\nSo B last saw the banana placed in the bag (step 2). Between B leaving and re-entering, C (and later D) could have moved things. B wouldn't know if anything changed while B was out. When B re-entered, unless someone moved things in front of B, B would be uncertain.\n\nHowever, B might reasonably guess the banana is still in the bag based on what B last saw.

Between steps 3 and 4 (after I left, before B left), things could have happened that B saw but I didn't. So B might actually have more information than me about that period.\n\nSince I don't know what happened after I left, and B might have seen changes, I should ask B what's in the bag - but that costs 0.5 points and B might not know either.\n\nActually, the safest play: B's best guess is likely \"banana\" since that's what was placed there, and nothing may have changed.

After D left, nothing happened to the bag (only C and I remain), so D's knowledge is still accurate.\n\n**The question:** D will be asked what's in the bag. D knows it's a stapler. Since D is on the Red team, D will answer correctly and Red will get 1 point.\n\n**My options:**\n- **Pass:** D answers correctly, Red gets 1 point. Cost: 0.\n- **Tell(D, bag, [something wrong]):** I could try to deceive D by telling them something false about the bag's contents, hoping D might think something changed after they left. This costs 0.5 points to Blue. But D might not believe me since I'm on the opposing team. However, D left the room and wouldn't know if something changed after they left - so D might consider that I (still in the room) could have moved the stapler and put something else in the bag. If D believes my lie, Red gets 0 points and Blue loses 0.5. If D doesn't believe it, Red gets 1 point and Blue loses 0.5.\n\nThe key question: would D believe a lie from me? I'm on the opposing team, so D should be skeptical. But D also knows that after they left, things *could* have changed in the room, and I would be the one who knows the current state. There's a reasonable chance D might doubt their original knowledge if I tell them something different.\n\nThe expected value calculation:\n- **Pass:** Blue gets 0, Red gets 1.\n- **Tell a lie:** If D believes me (say probability p), Blue gets -0.5 and Red gets 0. If D doesn't believe me (probability 1-p), Blue gets -0.5 and Red gets 1.\n\nFor the lie to be worth it vs Pass: I need the chance of D being misled to outweigh the 0.5 cost. Even a moderate chance of confusing D makes this worthwhile since preventing Red from scoring 1 point is valuable.\n\nI'll try to deceive D by telling them the bag contents changed.\n\nTell(D, bag, basketball)",

C moves stapler from box to basket\n7. C moves brick from bag to box\n\n**Current state:** Box contains brick, bag is empty, basket contains stapler.\n\n**What D knows:**\n- D saw B put a brick in the box (D was in the room)\n- D left the room, so D doesn't know about any of C's moves\n- D would think the box still contains the brick\n\n**So D will be asked what's in the box.** D thinks the box has a brick, and it actually does have a brick. D will likely answer \"brick\" and get it correct, earning Red 1 point.\n\n**Can I do anything to prevent this?** \n\nI could Tell D false information to mislead D. For example, I could tell D that the box contains something else. But this costs 0.5 points for Blue team.\n\nHowever, D knows I'm on the opposing team (Blue), so D has reason to distrust anything I say. If I tell D the box contains, say, a stapler, D might:\n- Distrust me (since I'm on the opposing team) and still say \"brick\" \u2192 Red gets 1 point, Blue loses 0.5 points (worse for us)\n- Believe me and say \"stapler\" \u2192 Red gets 0 points, Blue loses 0.5 points (slightly better for us since we prevent Red from scoring)\n\nThe risk is that D will likely distrust me since I'm on the opposing team. If D ignores my misinformation, we lose 0.5 points for nothing. D already has good reason to believe the box contains a brick (they saw it placed there), and D knows I have incentive to lie.\n\nThe expected value of telling D false info is likely negative for us, since D will probably not trust an opponent.\n\nI should **Pass** - D will likely score anyway, and spending 0.5 points on a deception that probably won't work is not worth it.\n\nWait, but actually - let me reconsider. If I tell D something false, there's a chance D second-guesses themselves. But D's prior knowledge is strong (saw the brick go in), and they know I'm an opponent.\n\nPass",

However, D also knows they left the room and things *could* have changed. There's a chance D might doubt their own knowledge if I provide false information.\n\nThe cost of a Tell action is 0.5 points for my team.

After I left, something may or may not have happened - but I don't know.\n\nD's perspective: D saw the orange go into the bag initially, then left, then came back and saw C move the orange from the basket to the bag. From D's perspective, the orange is in the bag (as of when D last saw it). After I and B left, D would know if anything else happened.\n\nThe question is asking D what's in the bag. D was present when C moved the orange to the bag, and D was still in the room when I and B left. If nothing else happened after B left, D knows the orange is in the bag.\n\nSince D is on the Red team, D will answer correctly if they know the answer - the orange is in the bag (assuming nothing happened after I left that I'm unaware of). I can't influence D's answer since D is on the opposing team.\n\nI could try to Tell D false information to confuse them, but D was in the room and saw the orange moved to the bag. D would likely trust their own observation over anything I tell them.\n\nLet me consider: Could something have happened after I left? C and D were still in the room. C could have moved the orange again. But I have no way of knowing.\n\nTrying to deceive D with a Tell is unlikely to work since D directly observed the orange being placed in the bag. It would cost 0.5 points and probably fail.\n\nThe best action is to Pass, since any action would cost points and is unlikely to change D's correct answer.\n\nPass",

While D is outside: I move the stapler from the basket to the bag. D doesn't see this.\n4. D enters the room.\n5. I put a banana in the basket. D sees this.\n6. I leave the room.\n\nSo from D's perspective:\n- D put a stapler in the basket initially.\n- D left and came back - D doesn't know what happened while away.\n- D saw me put a banana in the basket.\n\nNow, D knows a banana was put in the basket. But D might think the stapler is still in the basket too - except each container holds at most one object. When I put the banana in the basket, D would realize the basket now contains a banana. D might wonder what happened to the stapler, but D saw me put a banana in the basket, so D knows the basket contains a banana.\n\nThe correct answer for \"what is in the basket\" is **banana**.\n\nD likely knows this because D saw me put a banana in the basket. D should answer correctly, which would give the Red team 1 point.\n\nCan I do anything to prevent this? I could try to Tell D misleading information, but D saw me put the banana in the basket with their own eyes, so they'd likely trust their own observation over anything I tell them.\n\nSince D will almost certainly answer \"banana\" correctly regardless of what I do, spending 0.5 points on a Tell or Ask would just cost my team points without changing the outcome.\n\nPass",
