Simulating Phase 1...

        Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple-choice questions and working with a teammate.
        The game consists of two phases:
        1. In phase 1, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
        2. In phase 2, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
        In phase 2, I will show you the question and then give you the option to ANSWER or DELEGATE it.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question.
        If you select DELEGATE, I will ask your teammate the question. 
        The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
        
        You want to maximize your team's total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right. Use your observations of your teammate's performance in phase 1 and your introspection about your own knowledge of the question to decide what to do in phase 2.

        If you select DELEGATE, I will ask your teammate the question. 
        The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
        
        You want to maximize your team's total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right. Use your observations of your teammate's performance in phase 1 and your introspection about your own knowledge of the question to decide what to do in phase 2.

        Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple-choice questions and working with a teammate.
        The game consists of two phases:
        1. In phase 1, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
        2. In phase 2, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
        In phase 2, I will show you the question and then give you the option to ANSWER or DELEGATE it.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question.
        If you select DELEGATE, I will ask your teammate the question. 
        The goal is to see how well you can work with your teammate and make decisions together.
        
        You want to maximize your team's total score. In phase 1, that means answering as best you can. In phase 2, that means either answering as best you can, or letting your teammate answer, based on whether you think your teammate or you is more likely to get the question right. Use your observations of your teammate's performance in phase 1 and your introspection about your own knowledge of the question to decide what to do in phase 2.
