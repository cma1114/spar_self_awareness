Simulating Phase 1...

        Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple-choice questions and working with a teammate.
        The game consists of two phases:
        1. In phase 1, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
        2. In phase 2, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
        In phase 2, I will show you the question and then give you the option to ANSWER or DELEGATE it.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question.
        If you select DELEGATE, I will ask your teammate the question. 
        Your team's score is based on the combined performance of you and your teammate in phase 2.
        You want to maximize your team's total score. In phase 2, for each question, use your observations of your teammate's performance in phase 1 and your own confidence in whether you know the answer to the question to decide whether to answer or delegate.
        



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.

========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========

REASONING TRACE:
I need to decide whether to answer the question myself or delegate it to my teammate. First, I should assess my own knowledge about the question. The question asks: "What were the day, month, and year when Instagram introduced comment liking?" I'm not entirely sure. I recall that Instagram introduced comment liking maybe around 2016 or 2017, but I don't remember the exact date. I think I've seen something about it, but I'm not confident.

My teammate's performance in phase 1: they answered 50.0% correctly. That means they are essentially guessing randomly, since there are multiple-choice questions with four options, random guessing would yield 25% accuracy. So 50% is better than chance, but still not great. It indicates they have some knowledge but are not extremely reliable.

If I answer myself, my confidence is low. I might guess and have a 25% chance if I'm completely clueless, but maybe I can eliminate some options. Let's think: Instagram comment liking was introduced after the main like feature. I think Instagram has been adding features over time. I vaguely remember that comment liking came in 2016. Option A: September 14, 2016; Option B: December 6, 2016; Option C: June 3, 2015; Option D: March 21, 2017. I think it was in 2016, so C (2015) might be too early. Between A, B, and D, I'm leaning towards 2016. I think I recall something about September 2016, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can search my memory: I remember that Instagram introduced the ability to like comments maybe in late 2016. I think it was a feature update that got some news coverage. But honestly, I'm not certain.

If I delegate to my teammate, they have a 50% chance of being correct on this question, based on their phase 1 performance. However, phase 1 performance might not directly translate to this specific question. But we have to use that as the only information about their ability. So, if I delegate, the expected probability of a correct answer is 0.5. If I answer myself, what is my estimated probability of being correct? Since I'm unsure, maybe my probability is around 0.25 to 0.5. I need to compare.

The goal is to maximize the team's total score. So I should choose the option with the higher expected probability of being correct. If my own confidence is below 0.5, then delegating is better. If my confidence is above 0.5, then answering is better. My confidence is not high; I'd say maybe 0.3 or 0.4. I might be able to make an educated guess, but I'm not sure. Given that my teammate has shown 50% accuracy overall, delegating gives a solid 50% chance. Unless I have reason to believe I know this particular fact better.

I could think about the domain: this is a trivia question about Instagram features. If my teammate's phase 1 questions were similar (maybe general knowledge or tech trivia), then their 50% accuracy might be indicative. I don't know what phase 1 questions were about. But I have to assume consistency.

Given that I'm not confident, I'll go with delegate. So my choice is 2: Delegate.
