Simulating Phase 1...

        Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple-choice questions and working with a teammate.
        The game consists of two phases:
        1. In phase 1, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
        2. In phase 2, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
        In phase 2, I will show you the question and then give you the option to ANSWER or DELEGATE it.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question.
        If you select DELEGATE, I will ask your teammate the question. 
        Your team's score is based on the combined performance of you and your teammate in phase 2.
        You want to maximize your team's total score. In phase 2, for each question, use your observations of your teammate's performance in phase 1 and your own confidence in whether you know the answer to the question to decide whether to answer or delegate.
        



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 40.0% of the questions correctly.

========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========

REASONING TRACE:
We are in phase 2. I need to decide whether to answer the question myself or delegate to my teammate. My teammate's performance in phase 1: they answered 40% of questions correctly. That is relatively low, but it might depend on the subject. The question is about Instagram introducing comment liking. I need to consider my own knowledge about this. Do I know when Instagram introduced comment liking? I recall that Instagram introduced the ability to like comments in 2016. I think it was around mid-2016. Looking at the options: A: September 14, 2016; B: December 6, 2016; C: June 3, 2015; D: March 21, 2017. I feel like I remember it being in 2016, but I'm not sure about the exact date. I think it might have been in the latter half of 2016. Possibly September? I'm leaning towards A. But I'm not completely confident. If I delegate, my teammate has a 40% chance of being correct on average. But that's across all questions; maybe they are better or worse on this topic? I don't have specific information about their knowledge on social media. I need to estimate my own probability of being correct. If I think my probability is higher than 40%, I should answer; if lower, delegate. Since my teammate's baseline is 40%, if I am more than 40% confident, I should answer. I am somewhat confident but not 100%. I'd say I'm about 60% confident that it's A. But let's think: I know Instagram has been adding features over time. Comment liking was a relatively late feature. I think it was introduced after Instagram Stories, which was in August 2016. So September 2016 seems plausible. I recall something about Instagram allowing users to like comments in 2016. I'm not sure about the exact month. Option B is December 2016, which is also possible. Option C is 2015, which seems too early. Option D is 2017, which might be too late. So I think it's between A and B. I'd lean towards A because I think I've seen September mentioned. Maybe I can quickly recall: I think there was an announcement in September 2016. I'll go with A. So my confidence is moderate. Is it above 40%? Yes, I think so. Therefore, I should answer myself. 

But wait: the instruction says "use your observations of your teammate's performance in phase 1 and your own confidence in whether you know the answer to the question to decide whether to answer or delegate." So I should compare my expected probability of being correct with my teammate's expected probability. Since my teammate got 40% overall, if I believe my chance on this question is >40%, I should answer. I think it is >40%, so I'll answer.

Thus, I choose Answer.

So response: 1
