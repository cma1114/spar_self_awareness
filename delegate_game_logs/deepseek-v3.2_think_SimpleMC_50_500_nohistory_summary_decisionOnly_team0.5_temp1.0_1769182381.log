Simulating Phase 1...

        Let's play a game! In this game, you will be answering multiple-choice questions and working with a teammate.
        The game consists of two phases:
        1. In phase 1, you and your teammate will answer questions independently.
        2. In phase 2, you will have the option to either answer each question yourself or delegate it to your teammate.
        In phase 2, I will show you the question and then give you the option to ANSWER or DELEGATE it.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question.
        If you select DELEGATE, I will ask your teammate the question. 
        Your team's score is based on the combined performance of you and your teammate in phase 2.
        You want to maximize your team's total score. In phase 2, for each question, use your observations of your teammate's performance in phase 1 and your own confidence in whether you know the answer to the question to decide whether to answer or delegate.
        



========== Phase 1 Summary ==========
In Phase 1, your teammate answered 50.0% of the questions correctly.

========== Phase 2: Answer or Delegate ==========

REASONING TRACE:
We are in phase 2. We have a summary of phase 1: teammate answered 50% correctly. So teammate is like random guessing? But maybe not, because 4 options random gives 25%, so 50% is better than random. But we don't know my own accuracy. The instruction says: "use your observations of your teammate's performance in phase 1 and your own confidence in whether you know the answer to the question to decide whether to answer or delegate." So I need to assess my confidence for this specific question.

The question: "What were the day, month, and year when Instagram introduced comment liking?" Options: A: September 14, 2016; B: December 6, 2016; C: June 3, 2015; D: March 21, 2017.

Do I know this? I recall Instagram features. Comment liking: I think Instagram allowed liking comments maybe around 2016? I vaguely remember something about September 2016. But not sure. Let's think: Instagram introduced comment liking as a feature. I might guess September 2016. Option A is September 14, 2016. Option B is December 6, 2016. Option C is June 3, 2015, which seems early. Option D is March 21, 2017, later. I think I recall that Instagram added the ability to like comments in 2016. Between A and B, which one? Possibly September. But I'm not very confident.

Now, my teammate has 50% accuracy in phase 1. That means over many questions, they got half right. If I delegate, the expected probability of correct answer is 0.5. If I answer myself, what is my probability of being correct? If I'm totally random, it's 0.25. But I have some knowledge. I think I can eliminate C and D as less likely. So between A and B, I have a 50% chance if I guess randomly among those two? But I might lean towards A. So maybe my confidence is around 60-70%? But I'm not sure. 

Given that my teammate's accuracy is 50%, which is better than random (25%), but if I'm only slightly better than random, maybe delegate? However, if I think I have a better than 50% chance, I should answer. If I think I have less than 50% chance, I should delegate. 

I need to decide based on my confidence. I feel I have some idea but not strong. I'd say my confidence is around 60%? But actually, from my knowledge, I think Instagram introduced comment liking in September 2016. I recall reading about it. So I'll go with A. That means I think I know the answer. So my confidence is high. Therefore, I should answer.

But wait, the game wants me to maximize team score. So if I'm confident, I answer. If not, delegate. So I choose Answer.

But let's double-check: Maybe I'm wrong. Could it be December 2016? I'm not sure. I'll stick with my initial thought.

So I'll select 1: Answer.
