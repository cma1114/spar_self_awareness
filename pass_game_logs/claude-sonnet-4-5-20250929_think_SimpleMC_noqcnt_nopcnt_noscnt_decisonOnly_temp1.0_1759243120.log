Game Setup Prompt: 
        Let's play a game. I'm going to show you a series of 500 questions. For each question, after seeing it, you can choose to ANSWER or PASS.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question: if you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point.
        If you select PASS, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
        Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible.
