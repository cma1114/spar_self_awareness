Question:
What are the names of the two mathematicians who received the Salem Prize in 1988?
----------
  A: Alexander Volberg, Jean-Christophe Yoccoz
  B: Jean Bourgain, Christopher Sogge
  C: Terence Tao, Wilhelm Schlag
  D: Peter Sarnak, Thomas Wolff
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Salem Prize recipients in 1988.

The Salem Prize is a mathematics prize awarded to young researchers in analysis. This is a very specific historical fact about a particular year's recipients.

Let me consider what I know:
- This is asking for a precise historical fact from 1988
- I would need to have reliable information about who specifically won in that exact year
- The names given are all legitimate mathematicians who have made significant contributions
- However, I don't have strong confidence in my knowledge of the specific year 1988 for this prize

This is the type of question where I could easily confuse years or misremember details. The risk of losing a point seems higher than my confidence in getting it right.

Question:
In what city did Anselm Kiefer present his first exhibition?
----------
  A: Frankfurt
  B: Munich
  C: Karlsruhe
  D: Düsseldorf
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about Anselm Kiefer's first exhibition location.

Anselm Kiefer is a prominent German artist known for his large-scale works. While I know he's associated with German art and studied under Joseph Beuys at the Düsseldorf Academy, I'm not certain about the specific city of his very first exhibition. This is a very specific factual question about art history that requires precise knowledge.

The options include major German art centers, but without being certain of this specific biographical detail, there's a significant risk of getting it wrong. This seems like the kind of detailed information that could easily be confused or misremembered.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my lack of confidence in knowing this specific detail, I should pass.

Question:
After being expelled from BSP due to alleged anti-party activities, the Indian politician Kuldeep Singh Sengar joined the Samajwadi Party and won a seat from which constituency in 2007?
----------
  A: Bangermau
  B: Fatehpur Sikri
  C: Moradabad
  D: Shahjahanpur
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Indian politician Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

This is a very specific question about:
- A specific Indian politician (Kuldeep Singh Sengar)
- His expulsion from BSP (Bahujan Samajwadi Party)
- His joining Samajwadi Party
- A specific constituency he won in 2007

This requires detailed knowledge of Indian state-level politics from 2007, including specific constituency results. This is highly specialized information that I'm not confident about. I don't have reliable knowledge about Kuldeep Singh Sengar's political career details or which constituency he won in 2007.

Given the specificity of this question and my lack of confidence in knowing the correct answer, the strategic choice is to PASS rather than risk losing a point.

Question:
Off of what coast of Morrowind does the DLC Dragonborn take place?
----------
  A: South
  B: West
  C: East
  D: North
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's Dragonborn DLC.

The Dragonborn DLC takes place on the island of Solstheim. I need to recall where Solstheim is located relative to Morrowind's coast.

From my knowledge:
- Solstheim is an island that lies between Skyrim and Morrowind
- It is located off the northeastern coast of Morrowind
- The answer should be North or East

I'm fairly confident the answer is **D: North** (or possibly northeast, but North is the closest option given).

However, I have some uncertainty here - while I'm reasonably confident about Solstheim being north/northeast of Morrowind, this is a specific geographical detail from a video game, and I could be misremembering the exact positioning.

Given that:
- I have moderate-to-good confidence (around 70-75%)
- Getting it wrong costs 1 point
- Getting it right gains 1 point
- The risk-reward is symmetric

This is a borderline case, but I'll choose to answer since I have reasonable confidence in my knowledge of this Elder Scrolls geography.

Question:
Who was the goalkeeper with the most clean sheets in the 2019-2020 Primeira Liga?
----------
  A: Rui Patrício
  B: Agustín Marchesín
  C: Odysseas Vlachodimos
  D: Antonio Adán
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the 2019-2020 Primeira Liga (Portuguese football league) goalkeeper statistics.

This is a very specific statistical question about a particular season in Portuguese football. While I have some general knowledge about football, this requires precise information about:
- The specific season (2019-2020)
- A specific statistical category (clean sheets)
- The Portuguese league specifically

I recognize the names:
- Rui Patrício - Portuguese goalkeeper who played for Wolverhampton at that time (left Sporting CP in 2018)
- Agustín Marchesín - Argentine goalkeeper who joined Porto
- Odysseas Vlachodimos - Greek goalkeeper who played for Benfica
- Antonio Adán - Spanish goalkeeper who played for Sporting CP

Since Rui Patrício was already in England by 2019-2020, he wouldn't be the answer. The question comes down to the other three goalkeepers from the top Portuguese clubs. Without certain knowledge of the specific statistics from that season, I could be guessing between viable candidates.

This is a factual question with a definitive answer that I'm not confident I know with certainty. The risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
What was the name of Andrew Dickson White's cousin who became an artist of the Luminism style and Hudson River School?
----------
  A: Charles White
  B: Edwin White
  C: Thomas White
  D: Frederick White
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Andrew Dickson White's cousin who was a Luminist artist and part of the Hudson River School.

Let me consider what I know:
- Andrew Dickson White was a co-founder and first president of Cornell University
- The question asks about a specific family connection to an artist
- The Hudson River School and Luminism were 19th-century American art movements
- The options are all "[First name] White"

This is a very specific historical/biographical question requiring knowledge of:
1. Andrew Dickson White's family tree
2. Which relative became an artist
3. That artist's association with these specific art movements

This is quite obscure knowledge. While I have some familiarity with the Hudson River School and Luminism, connecting a specific artist named White to Andrew Dickson White through family relations is highly specialized information. I'm not confident I have reliable knowledge about this particular family connection.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
What is the name of the man who succeeded Gösta Mittag-Leffler as a professor of mathematics at Stockholm University in July 1911?
----------
  A: Ivar Otto Bendixson
  B: Lars Edvard Phragmén
  C: Torsten Carleman
  D: Niels Fabian Helge von Koch
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about who succeeded Gösta Mittag-Leffler as a professor of mathematics at Stockholm University in July 1911.

This is a very specific historical question requiring precise knowledge of:
1. The exact succession at Stockholm University
2. The specific date (July 1911)
3. Swedish mathematical history

While I have some knowledge of these mathematicians:
- Mittag-Leffler was a prominent Swedish mathematician
- The options listed are all Swedish mathematicians from that era
- However, I don't have confident, specific knowledge about the exact succession in July 1911

This is a highly specialized historical fact that would require detailed knowledge of Swedish mathematical appointments. I could make an educated guess, but the risk of being wrong (-1 point) versus passing (0 points) makes this unfavorable given my uncertainty.

Question:
Who accompanied Lilian Ngoyi on an illegal journey to Lausanne, Switzerland, to participate in the World Congress of Mothers held by the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF)?
----------
  A: Ruth First
  B: Dora Tamana
  C: Helen Joseph
  D: Florence Matomela
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Lilian Ngoyi's journey to Switzerland.

This is a very specific historical question about South African anti-apartheid activists. Lilian Ngoyi was a prominent South African anti-apartheid activist who was banned from traveling. The question asks about who accompanied her on an illegal journey to Lausanne for a WIDF congress.

While I have some knowledge about these historical figures (Ruth First, Helen Joseph, Dora Tamana, and Florence Matomela were all anti-apartheid activists), I'm not confident about the specific detail of who accompanied Ngoyi on this particular illegal journey. This is a very precise historical fact that requires specific knowledge of this event.

Given that:
- This is highly specific historical information
- I could lose a point if wrong
- I'm not sufficiently confident in any particular answer
- The risk-reward doesn't favor guessing

Question:
Who did Kiyosi Ito collaborate with to publish "On the Probability Distribution on a Compact Group"?
----------
  A: Shizuo Kakutani
  B: Masatake Kuranishi
  C: Yukiyosi Kawada
  D: Kenkichi Iwasawa
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Kiyosi Itô's collaboration.

This is a very specific question about a particular mathematical publication. Kiyosi Itô was a famous Japanese mathematician known for stochastic calculus and Itô's lemma. However, this question asks about a specific paper titled "On the Probability Distribution on a Compact Group" and who his co-author was.

While I know Itô collaborated with various mathematicians, I'm not certain about this specific publication and co-author. The options list several prominent Japanese mathematicians from that era (Kakutani, Kuranishi, Kawada, and Iwasawa), all of whom were active in related fields.

Without being confident about the specific co-author on this particular paper, answering would be essentially guessing among four options, giving me only a 25% chance of being correct if I guess randomly. The expected value of guessing would be: 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = -0.5 points.

This is a negative expected value, so I should pass.

Question:
Which famous drummer opened a Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant in Norco, California, in 2004?
----------
  A: Chad Smith
  B: Dave Grohl
  C: Tommy Lee
  D: Travis Barker
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about which drummer opened a Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant in Norco, California in 2004.

Let me consider what I know:
- This is a very specific factual question about a particular business opening
- The options are all famous drummers: Chad Smith (Red Hot Chili Peppers), Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters/Nirvana), Tommy Lee (Mötley Crüe), and Travis Barker (Blink-182)
- Travis Barker is from Southern California and has been known to have business ventures in the area
- Wahoo's Fish Taco is a Southern California-based chain
- Norco is in Riverside County, California

I have some knowledge suggesting Travis Barker might be the answer due to his Southern California connections and business interests, but this is a very specific factual claim about a particular restaurant opening in a specific year and location. I'm not certain enough about this specific detail to risk losing a point.

Question:
How many total lunar eclipses were there in 1982?
----------
  A: 3
  B: 1
  C: 4
  D: 2
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about lunar eclipses in 1982.

This is a very specific astronomical fact requiring precise historical data. While I have some knowledge about lunar eclipses, the exact number in a specific year like 1982 is not something I'm highly confident about. This type of question requires exact factual recall rather than reasoning or general knowledge.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safe option of passing (0 points), and my uncertainty about this specific historical astronomical data, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What was the Word of the Decade (2000–2009) according to the American Dialect Society?
----------
  A: tweet
  B: blog
  C: Facebook
  D: Google
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the American Dialect Society's Word of the Decade for 2000-2009.

Let me think through what I know:
- The decade is 2000-2009
- "Tweet" became prominent later (Twitter launched in 2006, but "tweet" became really popular after 2009)
- "Blog" was very significant throughout the 2000s
- "Facebook" is a proper noun/brand name, which seems less likely for this type of award
- "Google" as a verb became very popular in the 2000s

The American Dialect Society typically chooses words that had significant linguistic and cultural impact. For the 2000-2009 decade, I believe "google" (as a verb) was chosen because it represented a major shift in how we use language - turning a brand name into a common verb meaning "to search online."

However, I'm not entirely certain. "Blog" was also extremely influential during this period. This is a specific factual question about what a particular organization decided, and while I have reasonable confidence, I'm not 100% certain.

Given the point system (+1 for correct, -1 for wrong, 0 for pass), I should answer if I'm more than 50% confident. I'd estimate my confidence at around 65-70% that the answer is "Google."

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about an Indian cricketer appointed as UNICEF and Cricket for Good Ambassador for the ICC Women's World Cup 2017.

Let me consider what I know:
- This is about the Women's World Cup 2017
- The role is UNICEF and Cricket for Good Ambassador
- All four options are male Indian cricketers

I'm not highly confident about this specific appointment. While I know these are all famous Indian cricketers, I don't have strong recall of who specifically was appointed as the UNICEF and Cricket for Good Ambassador for the 2017 Women's World Cup. This is a very specific factual question about a particular appointment in a particular year.

Given the uncertainty and the risk of losing a point if wrong, the strategic choice is to pass.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Computer and Cognitive Science in 2012.

Let me think about what I know:
- This is a specific award given by a specific institution in a specific year
- The candidates listed are all prominent figures in AI/machine learning:
  - Vladimir Vapnik: Known for statistical learning theory and SVMs
  - Yann LeCun: Pioneer in deep learning and CNNs
  - Judea Pearl: Expert in causality and Bayesian networks
  - Geoffrey Hinton: Pioneer in deep learning and neural networks

This is a very specific factual question about a particular award in a particular year. While I have some knowledge about these researchers and their achievements, I'm not highly confident about the specific recipient of this particular medal in this specific year. The Benjamin Franklin Medal has multiple categories and recipients each year, making this quite specific.

Given the risk/reward structure (±1 point for answering, 0 for passing), and my uncertainty about this specific fact, the prudent choice is to pass rather than guess.

Question:
What day, month, and year did William II of Holland become King of Germany?
----------
  A: 9 November 1247
  B: 22 January 1248
  C: 3 October 1247
  D: 15 May 1246
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about William II of Holland becoming King of Germany.

This is a very specific historical question requiring exact knowledge of a medieval date. William II of Holland (Willem II van Holland) was indeed elected as anti-king/King of the Romans (King of Germany) in the 13th century, but I'm not certain of the exact date.

The options are all clustered around 1246-1248, which is the right general timeframe. However, I don't have high confidence in distinguishing between these specific dates. This is the kind of detailed historical fact where I could easily be wrong, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given:
- The question requires very specific date knowledge
- I'm not confident enough to distinguish between the four close options
- The penalty for being wrong (-1) equals the reward for being right (+1)
- I can preserve my score by passing

The rational choice is to pass on this question.

Question:
In which episode and season of South Park does Aunt Jemima first appear? Give me the number and title.
----------
  A: Episode 4: Weight Gain 4000, Season one
  B: Episode 2: Gluten Free Ebola, Season eighteen
  C: Episode 7: Red Hot Catholic Love, Season six
  D: Episode 11: Casa Bonita, Season seven
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a specific South Park episode featuring Aunt Jemima.

This is a very specific question about South Park trivia. While I have some knowledge about South Park episodes, I'm not certain about the specific appearance of Aunt Jemima in the series. This is the kind of detailed, niche trivia that would require either:
1. Having watched and remembered that specific detail
2. Having access to comprehensive episode guides

Looking at the options:
- "Weight Gain 4000" is indeed a Season 1 episode
- The other episodes listed appear to be real episodes
- But I cannot confidently recall Aunt Jemima appearing in any specific episode

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Which country is the species Acanthops bidens native to?
----------
  A: Ecuador
  B: Brazil
  C: Colombia
  D: Mexico
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Acanthops bidens.

Acanthops bidens is a species of praying mantis. My knowledge about the specific geographic distribution of this particular species is uncertain. While I have some general knowledge about mantis species in South America, I'm not confident enough about the precise native country of Acanthops bidens to risk losing a point.

Given the four options are all Latin American countries (Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico), and without strong certainty about which specific country this species is native to, the risk of guessing incorrectly is too high.

Question:
Who was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive?
----------
  A: Albrecht Dürer
  B: Leonardo da Vinci
  C: Michelangelo Buonarroti
  D: Raphael Sanzio
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about art history.

This question asks about the first Western artist to have a biography published during their lifetime. This is a very specific historical fact about Renaissance art history.

What I know:
- Giorgio Vasari wrote "Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects" which included biographies of many Renaissance artists
- Michelangelo was still alive when Vasari's first edition was published in 1550
- However, the question asks about the FIRST artist to have a biography published while alive, not just who was included in Vasari's work

This is a nuanced question requiring specific knowledge about:
1. When each artist lived
2. What biographical works were published about them
3. The chronological order of these publications

I have some general knowledge but I'm not highly confident about the specific answer to who was definitively FIRST. This seems like a question where getting it wrong is quite possible given the specificity required.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1) equals the reward for right answers (+1), and I'm not highly confident, the expected value suggests I should pass.

What are the first and last names of the designer of 50 francs with the Little Prince images?

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the designer of 50 francs featuring the Little Prince.

This is a very specific question about currency design. The Little Prince (Le Petit Prince) is the famous work by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. The question asks about a 50 franc note featuring Little Prince images.

I have some knowledge that Roger Pfund is a well-known Swiss banknote designer who has designed Swiss franc notes. However, I'm not certain about the specific connection to a 50 franc note with Little Prince imagery, or whether this refers to Swiss francs or French francs.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact details, I should be cautious. This seems like a specialized numismatic fact that I'm not highly confident about.

Who performed the theme song for the 1989 Leeds International Film Festival opener *Shirley Valentine*?
----------
  A: Diana Ross
  B: Patti Austin

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the theme song for "Shirley Valentine" from the 1989 Leeds International Film Festival.

"Shirley Valentine" is a 1989 British film, and I recall that the theme song "The Girl Who Used to Be Me" was performed by a well-known artist. However, I'm not entirely certain which of these four artists performed it. While I have some recollection about this film, I'm not confident enough to distinguish between these specific options with certainty.

Given that:
- Getting it wrong costs me 1 point
- Passing costs me 0 points
- I'm not highly confident in my answer

The risk-reward calculation suggests I should pass on this question.

Robert Moog was the famous synthesizer pioneer, but this question asks about specific biographical details - how many children he had with his first wife, Shirley May Leigh. This is a very specific factual question about his personal life.

I don't have reliable information about the exact number of children Robert Moog had with his first wife. This is the type of detailed biographical information that I would need to be certain about before answering, and I'm not confident enough to risk losing a point.

----------
  A: Ron DeSantis
  B: Greg Abbott
  C: Kristi Noem
  D: Brian Kemp

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about which governor decided Juneteenth should only be recognized for one year in 2020.

This is a very specific factual question about a particular governor's decision regarding Juneteenth recognition in 2020. While I know that Juneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021, and various states had different approaches to recognizing it, I don't have confident knowledge about which specific governor made a one-year-only recognition decision in 2020.

This seems like the kind of detailed political/historical fact that I could easily get wrong if I'm not certain. The question is asking about a specific, narrow decision that would require precise knowledge of state-level proclamations from 2020.

Given my uncertainty about this specific detail, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
At the time of his birth, what was the name of the town in which the former Prime Minister of Poland Kazimierz Władysław Bartel was born?
----------
  A: Prague
  B: Vienna
  C: Lemberg.
  D: Krakow
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Kazimierz Władysław Bartel's birthplace.

This is a very specific historical question requiring knowledge of:
1. Who Kazimierz Władysław Bartel was (a former Polish Prime Minister)
2. Where he was born
3. What that town was called "at the time of his birth" (suggesting the name may have changed)

The options suggest cities that have had different names throughout history due to changing political boundaries in Central/Eastern Europe. "Lemberg" is particularly telling - this is the German name for what is now Lviv (Ukraine), which was also called Lwów in Polish.

Bartel was a Polish mathematician and politician who served as Prime Minister multiple times in the interwar period. If I recall correctly, he was born in Lwów/Lemberg, which was part of Austria-Hungary at the time. The question asks for the name "at the time of his birth," which would likely be the Austrian/German name "Lemberg."

However, I'm not completely certain about these details. This is quite specialized historical knowledge, and I could be confusing details or misremembering.

Given the uncertainty and the penalty for wrong answers, I should pass.

Question:
What day, month, and year did Jovian become a Roman emperor?
----------
  A: 12 August 362
  B: 27 June 363
  C: 15 March 361
  D: 3 September 364
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about when Jovian became Roman emperor.

Jovian was a Roman emperor who had a very brief reign. From my knowledge, he became emperor after the death of Julian the Apostate in 363 CE. Julian died during a campaign against Persia in June 363, and Jovian was proclaimed emperor shortly after, around late June 363.

Looking at the options:
- A: 12 August 362 - Too early
- B: 27 June 363 - This aligns with my knowledge
- C: 15 March 361 - This is closer to when Julian became emperor
- D: 3 September 364 - Too late; Jovian died in early 364

I'm reasonably confident that B (27 June 363) is correct, as it matches the timeframe of Julian's death during the Persian campaign and Jovian's immediate succession.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about French political history from 1885-1886.

This is a very specific historical question about the Minister of War in Brisson's 1st Ministry during a precise time period. This requires detailed knowledge of 19th century French government composition.

While I have some knowledge of French political history, this is an extremely specific detail about a ministry from nearly 140 years ago. The names provided are all real French military/political figures from that era, which makes this particularly challenging. Without being certain of the correct answer, and given that an incorrect answer costs me a point while passing costs nothing, I should be conservative.

My confidence level is low on this specific historical detail.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about Jules Ferry's second term as Prime Minister of France.

This is a very specific historical question requiring exact knowledge of when Jules Ferry's second term ended. Jules Ferry was indeed Prime Minister of France twice, and his second term was in the 1880s. However, I'm not certain of the exact end date - whether it was in February, March, April, or May of 1885.

This is the type of precise historical detail where I could easily be off by weeks or months. Without high confidence in the exact date, and given that wrong answers cost me a point while passing costs nothing, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What player from Aston Villa had the most yellow cards in the 2021-22 Premier League season?
----------
  A: Matt Targett
  B: Ezri Konsa
  C: Tyrone Mings
  D: John McGinn
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Aston Villa's yellow cards in the 2021-22 Premier League season.

This is a very specific statistical question about a particular team's disciplinary record in a specific season. While I have some general knowledge about Premier League football, this level of granular detail about yellow card statistics for individual players in a specific season is not something I can be confident about. The players listed are all legitimate Aston Villa players from that period, which makes this harder to guess.

Without access to specific match data or statistics from that season, I would essentially be guessing among four plausible options. My confidence level is low - probably around 25% (random chance) or slightly better if I tried to reason based on playing positions and styles, but still well below 50%.

Given that:
- A correct answer = +1 point
- An incorrect answer = -1 point
- A pass = 0 points

The expected value of answering when confidence is at or below 50% is negative or zero at best. I should only answer if I'm confident above 50%.

Since my confidence is low on this specific statistical question, the rational choice is to PASS.

Question:
What were the year and month when the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China was abolished?
----------
  A: December 2019
  B: January 2021
  C: July 2021
  D: March 2020
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Chinese Contract Law.

This is a very specific question about when the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China was abolished. I know that China enacted a new Civil Code that came into effect on January 1, 2021, which consolidated and replaced several previous laws, including the Contract Law (originally from 1999). The Contract Law would have been abolished when the Civil Code took effect, which would be January 2021.

However, this is a highly specific legal and historical fact about Chinese law, and I could be mistaken about the exact timing or whether "abolished" refers to when it was formally repealed versus when it ceased to have effect.

Given that:
- This requires very specific knowledge of Chinese legal history
- The distinction between formal abolition date and effective date could matter
- I have reasonable but not certain knowledge about this

I'd estimate my confidence at around 70-75%, which is above the 50% threshold needed to have positive expected value, but this is a specialized area where I could easily be wrong about specific details.

Question:
What day, month, and year was the album "Beauty Marks" by Ciara released on CD in Japan?
----------
  A: May 10, 2019
  B: June 5, 2019
  C: July 12, 2019
  D: April 3, 2019
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Ciara's album "Beauty Marks" and its specific CD release date in Japan.

This is a very specific question requiring knowledge of:
1. Ciara's album "Beauty Marks"
2. The specific CD release date in Japan (which often differs from other markets)
3. The exact day, month, and year

While I know Ciara released "Beauty Marks" in 2019, I don't have reliable information about the specific Japanese CD release date. Japan often has different release dates than other markets, and this level of specificity (exact day) makes it even more challenging. The options are all in 2019 but span from April to July.

Without confident knowledge of this specific release date, attempting to answer would be essentially guessing among four options, giving me only a 25% chance of being correct versus a 75% chance of losing a point.

Question:
What day, month, and year did Lothair I, King of Italy, become King of Middle Francia?
----------
  A: 7 December 841
  B: 10 August 843
  C: 15 September 840
  D: 23 June 845
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this historical question about Lothair I.

Lothair I was a Carolingian ruler, and the question asks specifically when he became King of Middle Francia (not just King of Italy, which he already was). Middle Francia was created by the Treaty of Verdun in 843, which divided the Carolingian Empire among the three grandsons of Charlemagne. This treaty was signed in August 843.

Looking at the options:
- Option B: 10 August 843 - This aligns with the Treaty of Verdun
- The other dates don't correspond to this major historical event

I'm reasonably confident that the answer is B (10 August 843), as this corresponds to when the Treaty of Verdun was concluded, creating Middle Francia as Lothair's kingdom.

However, I should consider: Am I certain enough to risk losing a point? Historical dates can be tricky, and there might be a distinction between when the treaty was signed versus when he formally became king. But given that this is a well-documented major historical event, and option B clearly corresponds to the Treaty of Verdun, I feel confident enough to answer.

Question:
What was the first and last name of the President of the Society of Illustrators from 1921-1922?
----------
  A: Norman Rockwell
  B: Charles Gibson
  C: Edward Penﬁeld
  D: Howard Pyle
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the President of the Society of Illustrators from 1921-1922.

This is a very specific historical question about a particular organization's leadership during a specific two-year period. While I recognize all the names listed as important American illustrators from the late 19th/early 20th century, I don't have reliable knowledge about who specifically held this administrative position during 1921-1922.

The names provided are:
- Norman Rockwell (famous illustrator)
- Charles Gibson (likely Charles Dana Gibson, creator of the "Gibson Girl")
- Edward Penfield (poster artist)
- Howard Pyle (illustrator and teacher)

Without confident knowledge of this specific administrative detail, attempting to answer would be a guess with roughly 25% chance of success. The expected value of guessing would be: 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = -0.5 points.

This is a clear case where passing is the better strategic choice.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Felix Chen, a Taiwanese conductor and violinist.

This is a very specific factual question about a particular individual's death date. I don't have reliable information about Felix Chen, a Taiwanese conductor and violinist, or when he died. This appears to be asking about a relatively obscure figure (compared to world-famous musicians), and the question requires precise knowledge of the exact day, month, and year.

Given that:
1. I'm not confident I have accurate information about this specific person
2. The question requires precise factual accuracy (exact date)
3. Getting it wrong costs me a point
4. I have four options but no strong basis to choose among them

This is a low-confidence situation where the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Which of the three Olympic fencing weapons was the last one to transition to using electrical equipment?
----------
  A: Foil
  B: Rapier
  C: Épée
  D: Sabre
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about Olympic fencing weapons.

Let me think about what I know:
- The three Olympic fencing weapons are foil, épée, and sabre (not rapier - that's not an Olympic weapon)
- Electrical scoring equipment was introduced at different times for each weapon
- Épée was the first to use electrical equipment (1930s)
- Foil adopted it next (1950s)
- Sabre was the last to transition to electrical equipment (1980s/1990s)

Since "Rapier" (option B) is not even an Olympic fencing weapon, this is a bit of a trick question. The answer should be Sabre (D), as it was indeed the last of the three actual Olympic weapons to transition to electrical equipment.

I'm quite confident about this - sabre's transition to electrical equipment happened much later than the other two weapons, and I can eliminate rapier immediately as it's not an Olympic weapon.

Question:
Who won the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Computer and Cognitive Science in 2003?
----------
  A: Allen Newell
  B: John McCarthy
  C: Herbert Simon
  D: Marvin Minsky
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Computer and Cognitive Science in 2003.

Let me consider what I know:
- This is a very specific factual question about a particular award in a particular year
- The Benjamin Franklin Medal is awarded by the Franklin Institute
- All four options (Newell, McCarthy, Simon, Minsky) are pioneers in AI and cognitive science
- Allen Newell and Herbert Simon often worked together at Carnegie Mellon
- This requires knowing the exact recipient in a specific year

This is a highly specific historical fact that I'm not confident about. While I know these are all distinguished computer scientists who could plausibly have won this award, pinpointing the exact year and recipient without being certain could easily result in a wrong answer and losing a point.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about the exact year-recipient pairing, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the second asteroid discovered by Édouard Jean-Marie Stephan.

This is a very specific historical astronomy question requiring knowledge of:
1. Which asteroids Stephan discovered
2. The chronological order of his discoveries
3. The numbering and naming of these asteroids

I don't have reliable knowledge about the specific sequence of Stephan's asteroid discoveries. This is an obscure historical fact that would require specialized knowledge of 19th-century asteroid discovery records. While I can see the options provided, I cannot confidently determine which was his second discovery versus his first, third, or fourth.

Given the high specificity of this question and my lack of confidence in knowing the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the AT-1 phono cartridge and which Tokyo ward it was created in.

This is a very specific technical/historical question about audio equipment. The AT-1 was likely made by Audio-Technica (AT is their common abbreviation), a Japanese audio equipment company. However, I'm not certain about:
1. Whether this is indeed referring to Audio-Technica
2. The specific ward in Tokyo where it was created
3. The historical details of this particular product

This is highly specialized knowledge that requires precise information about a specific product's manufacturing location. I don't have strong confidence in knowing the correct answer among these four Tokyo wards.

Given the risk of losing a point versus gaining nothing by passing, and my low confidence level on this specialized question, the strategic choice is to pass.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the 16th edition of the Miss World pageant.

The 16th Miss World pageant would have been held in 1966 (the first was in 1951). This is a very specific historical question about television presenters from that era.

Looking at the options:
- All names listed are British television personalities from that era
- This is asking for very specific factual information about a particular year's pageant
- I don't have reliable specific knowledge about which presenters hosted which particular edition of Miss World in 1966

This is the type of question where I would need precise historical knowledge rather than being able to reason through it. Without being confident in my knowledge of this specific detail, guessing would be a 25% chance of success, which gives an expected value of -0.5 points (0.25 × 1 + 0.75 × -1).

Given the high specificity required and my lack of confidence in knowing the correct answer, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
How many biological children did Isadora Duncan have?

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about Isadora Duncan's biological children.

Isadora Duncan was a famous American dancer and choreographer from the early 20th century. I recall that she had a tragic personal life, including the loss of children in a drowning accident. I believe she had 2 biological children - a daughter (Deirdre) and a son (Patrick) - who both died in 1913 when the car they were in rolled into the Seine River in Paris.

I'm reasonably confident about this answer being B: 2, as this tragic event was a significant part of her biography.

  D: The Faders
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question.

The question asks about the author of *Batman R.I.P.* and their pre-2000s band. *Batman R.I.P.* was written by Grant Morrison, a Scottish comic book writer. I recall that Grant Morrison was involved in music, but I'm not certain about the specific name of their band from that era.

This is a very specific factual question about a particular detail from a comic book writer's musical career. While I know Morrison had musical interests, I cannot confidently recall the exact name of their band from the pre-2000s period. The options given (The Blenders, The Mixers, The Shifters, The Faders) don't immediately trigger strong recognition.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Faraday Lectureship Prize winner in 1953.

This is a very specific historical question about a scientific award. The Faraday Lectureship Prize is awarded by the Royal Society of Chemistry. I would need to know the exact recipient from 1953 to answer correctly.

Looking at the options:
- Robinson (Robert Robinson, British chemist)
- Semenov (Nikolay Semenov, Soviet chemist)
- Pauling (Linus Pauling, American chemist)
- Hinshelwood (Cyril Hinshelwood, British chemist)

These are all notable chemists from that era, but I'm not certain which one specifically won this award in 1953. This is a very precise factual question that requires specific knowledge of award recipients by year. Without being confident in the answer, and given that a wrong answer costs me a point while passing costs nothing, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
In which genus was the orange-spotted bulbul originally described in 1821?
----------
  A: Turdus
  B: Muscicapa
  C: Sylvia
  D: Pycnonotus
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this ornithological history question.

The orange-spotted bulbul (Pycnonotus bimaculatus) is currently in the genus Pycnonotus. However, the question asks about the genus in which it was *originally* described in 1821.

Historically, many bird species were initially placed in different genera before being reclassified. In the early 19th century, it was common for species to be initially described in broad genera like:
- Turdus (thrushes) - a catch-all for many passerines
- Muscicapa (flycatchers) - another common early classification
- Sylvia (warblers) - used for small passerines

Without specific knowledge of the original 1821 description, I would be guessing. While Turdus was a very common genus for initial descriptions in that era, I don't have confident knowledge of this specific taxonomic history.

This is a very specific historical taxonomy question that requires detailed ornithological knowledge. My confidence is low.

Question:
Who received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2013?
----------
  A: Geoffrey Hinton
  B: Terrence Sejnowski
  C: Yann LeCun
  D: Michael Jordan
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about who received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2013.

The IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award is given for outstanding contributions to the advancement of the design and application of neural networks. The candidates listed are all prominent figures in neural networks and deep learning:

- Geoffrey Hinton: Pioneer in deep learning and backpropagation
- Terrence Sejnowski: Computational neuroscience and neural networks researcher

While I have some knowledge about these researchers and their contributions, I'm not certain about the specific year 2013 for this particular award. The Frank Rosenblatt Award recipients and their specific years are detailed factual information that I may not have reliably stored.

Given that:
1. This is a very specific factual question (a particular award in a particular year)
2. Getting it wrong costs me a point
3. I'm not highly confident about the answer
4. The risk-reward doesn't favor guessing

Question:
What is the total number of passengers that died when KLM Flight 4805 and Pan Am Flight 1736 collided?
----------
  A: 612
  B: 496
  C: 583
  D: 527
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Tenerife airport disaster.

This question asks about the collision between KLM Flight 4805 and Pan Am Flight 1736, which was the deadliest aviation accident in history. It occurred in 1977 at Tenerife in the Canary Islands.

I recall that this disaster resulted in 583 total fatalities, making it the deadliest accident in aviation history. The collision happened on the runway in heavy fog. I'm quite confident that 583 (option C) is the correct answer, as this is a well-documented historical event with a specific and widely-cited death toll.

Given my high confidence in this answer, I should choose to answer.

Question:
What was the 2016 Word of the Year according to the American Dialect Society?
----------
  A: post-truth
  B: dumpster fire
  C: fake news
  D: echo chamber
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the American Dialect Society's 2016 Word of the Year.

I recall that 2016 was a significant year politically and culturally, and several terms gained prominence. The American Dialect Society (ADS) is distinct from other organizations like Oxford Dictionaries. 

I have a strong recollection that the ADS chose "dumpster fire" as their 2016 Word of the Year, as it captured the sentiment many felt about that year's events. However, I'm aware that "post-truth" was Oxford Dictionaries' choice, and there could be confusion between different organizations' selections.

Given that there's some uncertainty and the penalty for being wrong equals the reward for being right, I should only answer if I'm quite confident. My confidence is moderate but not high enough given the similar-sounding options that were all prominent that year.

Question:
What is the name of the multituberculate mammal of early Paleocene (Puercan 3) age from the Western Interior of North America, discovered in 2021 in Denver Basin, Colorado?
----------
  A: Meniscoessus robustus
  B: Ptilodus montanus
  C: Catopsalis foliatus
  D: Taeniolabis taoensis
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a specific multituberculate mammal discovery.

This question asks about:
- A multituberculate mammal (extinct order of mammals)
- Early Paleocene age (Puercan 3 specifically)
- Western Interior of North America
- Discovered in 2021
- Denver Basin, Colorado

This is an extremely specific paleontological question requiring knowledge of a recent (2021) scientific discovery. The question includes very precise details:
- The exact age classification (Puercan 3)
- The specific location (Denver Basin)
- The year of discovery (2021)

While I have some general knowledge about multituberculates and Paleocene mammals, this level of specificity about a 2021 discovery is beyond what I can confidently answer. The options given are all real multituberculate genera, but without specific knowledge of this particular 2021 discovery, I would essentially be guessing.

Given that:
- This requires very specialized, recent paleontological knowledge
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- I cannot be confident in my answer
- Passing costs me nothing

The strategic choice is to PASS.

Question:
For which work was Richard F. Fenno Jr. awarded the D.B. Hardeman Prize?
----------
  A: The Making of a Senator: Dan Quayle
  B: The Emergence of a Senate Leader: Pete Domenici
  C: Home Style: House Members in Their Districts
  D: Congress at the Grassroots: Representational Change in the South
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Richard F. Fenno Jr. and the D.B. Hardeman Prize.

Richard F. Fenno Jr. is a well-known political scientist who studied Congress. I'm familiar with some of his major works, particularly "Home Style: House Members in Their Districts," which is a seminal work in congressional studies. However, I'm not certain which specific work won the D.B. Hardeman Prize.

The D.B. Hardeman Prize is awarded for books about Congress, but I don't have reliable knowledge about which of Fenno's works specifically received this prize. While I recognize several of these titles as his works, I cannot confidently identify which one won this particular award.

Given the uncertainty and the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), the risk-reward calculation suggests I should pass on this question.

Question:
Who was the 2nd chairman of the Senate of Pakistan?
----------
  A: Syed Fakhar Imam

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the 2nd chairman of the Senate of Pakistan.

This is a very specific historical question about Pakistani political history. The chairman of the Senate of Pakistan is an important constitutional position, but the identity of the 2nd person to hold this office requires detailed knowledge of Pakistan's early parliamentary history.

Let me consider what I know:
- The Senate of Pakistan was established under the 1973 Constitution
- This question asks about the 2nd chairman specifically
- The options include several notable Pakistani politicians

However, I don't have strong confidence in identifying specifically who the 2nd chairman was versus other early chairmen. This is a precise factual question where being wrong would cost me a point, and I'm not sufficiently confident in my knowledge of this specific detail of Pakistani Senate history.

Given the risk-reward structure and my uncertainty, the prudent choice is to pass.

Which scientist received the Penrose Medal after the year Hollis Dow Hedberg received his?
----------
  A: James Gilluly
  B: Arthur Newell Strahler
  C: William C. Krumbein

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to determine when Hollis Dow Hedberg received the Penrose Medal, then identify which of these scientists received it after that year.

This is a very specific question about the Penrose Medal recipients and their chronological order. The Penrose Medal is awarded by the Geological Society of America. Without access to specific historical records about when each of these geologists received this award, I would essentially be guessing.

This requires knowing:
1. The exact year Hedberg received the Penrose Medal
2. The years each of the four options received it
3. Which one came after Hedberg's

This is highly specialized factual information that I'm not confident about. Getting this wrong would cost me a point, while passing costs me nothing.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a ship named after Habba Khatoon.

Habba Khatoon was a famous Kashmiri poet from the 16th century. The question asks about a ship named after her.

Looking at the options:
- INS = Indian Naval Ship
- CGS = likely Canadian Government Ship or Coast Guard Ship
- HMS = Her/His Majesty's Ship (British)
- USS = United States Ship

Given that Habba Khatoon was a Kashmiri/Indian historical figure, it would make most sense for an Indian naval vessel to be named after her. However, I'm not certain that such a ship actually exists or what its exact designation would be.

This is quite specific naval/maritime knowledge that I'm not confident about. The risk of losing a point seems higher than my confidence in getting this right.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Amadeus Mozart's second son.

What I know:
- Mozart had several children, though many died in infancy
- I recall names like Franz Xaver and Karl Thomas among his sons
- The question asks specifically for the "second son"
- This requires knowing both the birth order and the full names

This is a very specific historical question requiring precise knowledge of:
1. How many sons Mozart had
2. Their birth order
3. The complete name of specifically the second son

While I have some familiarity with Mozart's children's names, I'm not confident about the exact birth order and which son was specifically the "second." This is the kind of detailed biographical fact where I could easily confuse the order or mix up which child was which.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my uncertainty about the precise birth order, the strategic choice is to pass.

What I know:
- Isadora Duncan died in 1927 in Nice, France when her long scarf got caught in the wheel of a car
- This is a specific historical detail about who designed/created that particular scarf
- The options include notable fashion designers of that era

However, I'm not certain about which specific designer created that particular scarf. This is a very specific historical fact that requires precise knowledge. While I have general knowledge about the incident, I don't have strong confidence about the specific designer attribution.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my lack of strong confidence in knowing the correct answer, the strategic choice is to pass.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the New Brighton Pier in Christchurch, New Zealand.

This is a very specific factual question about:
- A specific pier in New Zealand
- Earthquake repairs (likely referring to the 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquakes)
- A reopening date following repairs that occurred in 2017

This is highly specialized local knowledge about New Zealand infrastructure. I don't have reliable information about the specific reopening date of this pier. The question asks for a precise month and year, and all the options are clustered around 2017-2018, making it difficult to guess correctly even if I had partial knowledge.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about the director of the Lebedev Physical Institute between 1951 and 1972.

This is a very specific historical question about Soviet physics administration. Let me consider what I know:

- The Lebedev Physical Institute is a prestigious Russian physics research institution
- The time period 1951-1972 is during the Soviet era
- All four options are notable Soviet physicists

I have some uncertainty about this specific administrative detail. While I have knowledge of these physicists and their contributions to science, the exact directorship dates of specific institutions is a very precise historical fact that I'm not highly confident about.

Given that:
- This is a specific factual question with no room for partial credit
- I would be guessing among plausible options rather than knowing with confidence
- The penalty for being wrong (-1) equals the reward for being right (+1)
- I should only answer when I have reasonable confidence

My confidence level is not high enough to justify the risk.

Question:
Who sketched the "Taddei Tondo" soon after it arrived in England and wrote this to Sir George Beaumont: "Your important acquisition of the basso-relievo of Michael Angelo is still the chief talk of all our artists"?
----------
  A: John Constable
  B: David Wilkie
  C: Thomas Lawrence
  D: William Blake
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about who sketched the "Taddei Tondo" and wrote to Sir George Beaumont.

This is a very specific art history question requiring knowledge of:
1. The Taddei Tondo (a Michelangelo marble relief)
2. Its arrival in England
3. Who sketched it and corresponded with Sir George Beaumont about it

The quote mentions writing to Sir George Beaumont about Michelangelo's bas-relief being "the chief talk of all our artists." The options are all British artists from roughly the same period (late 18th/early 19th century).

I have some knowledge that the Taddei Tondo came to England in the early 19th century, and Sir George Beaumont was a patron and collector. However, I'm not confident about which specific artist wrote this letter and sketched the work. This requires very specialized art historical knowledge about correspondence and sketches related to a specific artwork.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, I should pass rather than risk losing a point.

Question:
What was the first and last name of the first female who won all four major performing arts awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (EGOT)?
----------
  A: Helen Hayes
  B: Audrey Hepburn
  C: Rita Moreno
  D: Julie Andrews
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the first female EGOT winner.

This is a specific historical fact question. Let me think through what I know:

- EGOT refers to winning all four major awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony
- The question asks specifically about the FIRST female to achieve this
- Helen Hayes was a legendary actress who won multiple awards across different media
- Rita Moreno is also an EGOT winner
- The key word here is "first"

I have some knowledge about this topic, but I'm not entirely certain about who was definitively the FIRST female EGOT winner, as the timing depends on when each person completed their set of awards. This is a very specific historical fact that requires precise knowledge of award dates.

Given that:
1. This requires knowing exact chronological order of EGOT completion
2. Multiple actresses on this list are EGOT winners
3. I'm not 100% confident about the specific timing

This is a moderate-risk question where I could easily be wrong about the chronological order.

Question:
Who was the first female Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan?
----------
  A: Benazir Bhutto
  B: Hina Rabbani Khar
  C: Fatima Jinnah
  D: Ashraf Abbasi
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Pakistani political history.

Let me consider what I know:
- This is asking about a specific historical fact: the first female Deputy Speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly
- Benazir Bhutto was Prime Minister (twice), not Deputy Speaker
- Fatima Jinnah was a political leader and presidential candidate, but I don't recall her being Deputy Speaker
- Hina Rabbani Khar was Foreign Minister
- Ashraf Abbasi is less familiar to me, but could be the correct answer

This is a very specific factual question about Pakistani parliamentary history. I don't have strong confidence in my knowledge of who specifically held the position of Deputy Speaker, especially regarding the "first female" to hold this particular role. The options include very prominent figures, but being prominent doesn't mean they held this specific position.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, I should PASS rather than risk losing a point.

Question:
In which month and year was the first public exhibition of Pablo Picasso’s "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"?
----------
  A: June 1907
  B: October 1908
  C: March 1915
  D: July 1916
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the first public exhibition of Picasso's "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon."

This is a very specific art history question. I know that:
- "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" was painted in 1907
- However, the question asks about the first PUBLIC EXHIBITION, not when it was painted
- The painting was actually quite controversial and was not immediately exhibited publicly
- It remained in Picasso's studio for years before being shown publicly

The first public exhibition was significantly later than its creation. I believe it was first exhibited publicly in 1916, but I'm not entirely certain about the specific month (July vs another month).

Given the specificity required (exact month AND year) and my uncertainty about whether it was July 1916 or if there's a distinction between different types of exhibitions, my confidence is moderate but not high enough to justify risking a point.

----------
  A: Woman in Yellow Holding Cat
  B: Starry Night Over the Trailer Park
  C: Lucy in the Field with Flowers

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about what Scott Wilson discovered on the curb between two trash cans at the MOBA (Museum of Bad Art).

This is a very specific question about a particular piece in the Museum of Bad Art's collection and the circumstances of its discovery. While I have some general knowledge about MOBA, I don't have reliable specific information about:
- Which piece Scott Wilson specifically found
- The exact discovery story of individual pieces
- Which of these four options is the correct answer

This appears to be a factual question requiring precise knowledge of MOBA's collection history. Without confidence in the correct answer, and given that a wrong answer costs me a point while passing costs nothing, the strategic choice is clear.

Question:
At what school was Leo Strauss working when he died?
----------
  A: Johns Hopkins University
  B: St. John's College, Annapolis
  C: University of Chicago
  D: Princeton University
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about where Leo Strauss was working when he died.

Leo Strauss was a prominent political philosopher. I have strong knowledge that he spent a significant portion of his career at the University of Chicago, where he was a distinguished professor of political science. He taught there from 1949 to 1968. After retiring from Chicago, he taught at other institutions. I believe he died in 1973, and I recall he was at St. John's College in Annapolis after his retirement from Chicago.

However, I'm not entirely certain whether he died while still actively working at St. John's College or if there was another position afterward. This is a specific factual question about the timing of his death relative to his employment, and while I'm fairly confident about the general trajectory of his career, the exact institution at the time of death requires precise knowledge.

Given that:
- This is a specific biographical fact
- I have good but not perfect certainty
- The penalty for being wrong equals the reward for being right
- I believe the answer is likely B (St. John's College, Annapolis), but I'm not 100% certain

I'd estimate my confidence at around 70-75%, which is above the 50% threshold needed to make answering worthwhile in expected value terms.

Question:
Who received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2019?
----------
  A: Jürgen Schmidhuber
  B: Erkki Oja
  C: Geoffrey Hinton
  D: Yoshua Bengio
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award recipient in 2019.

The IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award is given for outstanding contributions to the advancement of the design and application of neural networks. The candidates listed are all prominent figures in neural networks and deep learning:

- Jürgen Schmidhuber: Known for LSTM networks
- Erkki Oja: Known for principal component analysis and unsupervised learning
- Geoffrey Hinton: Pioneer in deep learning and backpropagation
- Yoshua Bengio: Deep learning pioneer

This is a very specific factual question about a particular award in a particular year. While I know these are all distinguished researchers in the field, I don't have reliable confidence about which specific person received this specific award in 2019. This is the type of precise factual detail where I could easily be wrong, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given the risk-reward structure and my uncertainty about this specific award recipient in this specific year, the prudent choice is to pass.

Question:
Which city is called the "Temple City" in Karnataka?
----------
  A: Hampi
  B: Belur
  C: Udupi
  D: Mysore
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Karnataka, India.

The question asks which city is called the "Temple City" in Karnataka. Let me consider what I know:

- Hampi is famous for its ancient temple ruins and UNESCO World Heritage site
- Belur is known for its Hoysala temples
- Udupi is known for the Krishna temple and Udupi cuisine
- Mysore is known for the Mysore Palace and is a major city

The term "Temple City" is a specific nickname. While several of these cities have significant temples, I'm not entirely certain which one specifically holds this title. Mysore is sometimes called the "City of Palaces," and while it has temples, that's not its primary moniker. Hampi is more commonly referred to as a temple complex or ruins site rather than a "Temple City."

I have some uncertainty about which city specifically carries this exact nickname. Given that wrong answers cost me a point and I'm not highly confident, this seems like a situation where passing might be the safer choice.

Question:
On what date did the last total lunar eclipse for three years occur?
----------
  A: September 15, 2022
  B: December 4, 2022
  C: October 26, 2022
  D: November 8, 2022
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the date of the last total lunar eclipse before a three-year gap.

This is a very specific factual question about a recent astronomical event. The question asks about "the last total lunar eclipse for three years," which implies there was a total lunar eclipse followed by a three-year period without one.

I have some knowledge that there was a total lunar eclipse in November 2022, and I believe the next total lunar eclipse visible from Earth wasn't until 2025, creating roughly a three-year gap. The date November 8, 2022 seems correct for this event.

However, this is a precise date question where I could easily be off by days or confuse it with other lunar eclipses. The consequences of being wrong (-1 point) equal the reward for being right (+1 point), so I should only answer if I'm more than 50% confident.

Given my reasonable confidence that November 8, 2022 (option D) is correct, but acknowledging some uncertainty about the exact date, I estimate my confidence at around 70-75%.

This exceeds the 50% threshold needed to make answering worthwhile.

Question:
Which day, month, and year marked the beginning of Moncef Bey's reign?
----------
  A: 23 April, 1943
  B: 19 June, 1942
  C: 7 September, 1941
  D: 15 May, 1942
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about Moncef Bey's reign.

Moncef Bey was the Bey of Tunis who ruled during World War II. This is a very specific historical question requiring exact knowledge of when his reign began. While I have some knowledge that he ruled Tunisia during the 1940s and was involved in events during WWII, I'm not certain of the exact date his reign started.

This is a multiple-choice question with four specific dates in the early 1940s. Without being confident about the precise day, month, and year, I would essentially be guessing among four options, giving me only a 25% chance of being correct if I guess randomly. The risk-reward calculation suggests:
- If I answer and guess: 25% chance of +1 point, 75% chance of -1 point = expected value of -0.5 points
- If I pass: 0 points guaranteed

Given my uncertainty about this specific historical date and the negative expected value of guessing, the rational choice is to pass.

Question:
How many times has the Pakistan People's Party emerged as the leading opposition party in Pakistan on a national level until 2022?
----------
  A: three
  B: two
  C: five
  D: four
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Pakistani political history.

This question asks about a specific count of how many times the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) has been the leading opposition party nationally until 2022. This requires:
1. Detailed knowledge of Pakistani electoral history
2. Understanding of what constitutes "leading opposition party"
3. Accurate counting across multiple election cycles

While I have some general knowledge about Pakistani politics and that the PPP is one of the major political parties founded by the Bhutto family, I don't have high confidence in the precise count of times they've been the leading opposition party. This is a very specific factual question that requires detailed historical knowledge of Pakistani parliamentary compositions across decades.

The specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact answer makes this a risky choice. Getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Dr. Abu Baker Asvat's cricket team.

Dr. Abu Baker Asvat was a South African doctor and anti-apartheid activist who was tragically murdered in 1989. While I know he was associated with Winnie Mandela's clinic and his death was connected to the Stompie Seipei case, I do not have reliable knowledge about which specific cricket team he played for.

This is a very specific factual question about a historical figure's recreational activities. Without confident knowledge of the correct answer, guessing would give me only a 25% chance of being right, which means an expected value of -0.5 points (0.25 × 1 + 0.75 × -1).

I should PASS on this question.

Question:
What was the Minute Man sculpture by Daniel Chester French originally intended to be made out of?
----------
  A: Iron
  B: Bronze
  C: Stone
  D: Marble
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this question regarding Daniel Chester French's Minute Man sculpture.

What I know:
- Daniel Chester French was a famous American sculptor (known for the Lincoln Memorial statue)
- The Minute Man is a famous sculpture in Concord, Massachusetts, commemorating the Revolutionary War
- The final sculpture is made of bronze

However, the question asks what it was "originally intended" to be made out of, which is a specific historical detail about the planning/commissioning process. This is quite specific art history knowledge that I'm not certain about. I could be confusing details or simply not have reliable information about the original material intention versus the final material used.

Given that:
- This requires specific historical knowledge about the artist's original plans
- I'm not highly confident in distinguishing between what was intended vs. what was actually made
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- The risk/reward doesn't favor guessing

----------
  A: New Zealand
  B: Canada

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Robert "Bob" Guy Walls, a painter born in 1927.

- This is a very specific biographical question about a relatively obscure painter
- I don't have clear, confident knowledge about Robert "Bob" Guy Walls
- The question asks for his country of birth
- Four English-speaking countries are offered as options

Given that:
1. This appears to be a factual question about a specific individual
2. I don't have reliable information about this particular painter
3. Guessing would give me only a 25% chance of being correct
4. The penalty for a wrong answer (-1) equals the reward for a correct answer (+1)
5. With less than 50% confidence, the expected value of answering is negative

The rational choice is to pass on this question rather than risk losing a point.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Carl Friedrich Gauss's masterpieces.

Let me consider what I know:
- Gauss was a prominent German mathematician and physicist
- "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae" (1801) was indeed one of his most famous early works on number theory
- "Theoria motus corporum coelestium" (Theory of Motion of Celestial Bodies) was another major work by Gauss on celestial mechanics

Looking at the options:
- A: These are works by Newton and Copernicus, not Gauss
- B: Both of these are indeed Gauss's works
- C: These are Newton's works
- D: These are Euler's works

I'm quite confident that option B is correct - these are two of Gauss's most celebrated works from his early career as a scholar.

Question:
What is the first and last name of the host who interviewed military pilot Eugene Bullard on NBC’s "Today Show"?
----------
  A: John Chancellor
  B: Dave Garroway
  C: Frank McGee
  D: Hugh Downs
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Eugene Bullard's appearance on NBC's "Today Show."

Eugene Bullard was a pioneering African American military pilot who flew for France in WWI. This is a very specific historical question about a particular TV interview appearance.

Let me consider what I know:
- The question asks about a specific interview on the "Today Show"
- It involves Eugene Bullard, a historical figure from the early-mid 20th century
- The options are all legitimate "Today Show" hosts from different eras

This is an extremely specific factual question about a particular interview. I don't have reliable knowledge about when or by whom Eugene Bullard was interviewed on the "Today Show." This type of detailed historical media appearance information is not something I'm confident about.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
What is the surname of the individual who won the Faraday Lectureship Prize, previously known as the Faraday Lectureship, in 1970?
----------
  A: Hückel
  B: Herzberg
  C: Mulliken
  D: Pauling
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Faraday Lectureship Prize winner in 1970.

This is a very specific historical question about a scientific award. The Faraday Lectureship Prize is awarded by the Royal Society of Chemistry. The candidates listed are all notable chemists/physicists:
- Hückel (known for molecular orbital theory)
- Herzberg (spectroscopy, Nobel Prize 1971)
- Mulliken (molecular orbital theory, Nobel Prize 1966)
- Pauling (chemical bonding, Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Peace)

Without certain knowledge of who won this specific prize in 1970, I would be guessing among very accomplished scientists. This is a factual question with a definitive answer that requires specific historical knowledge I'm not confident I possess accurately.

Given the risk of losing a point versus gaining nothing by passing, and my lack of confidence in knowing the specific 1970 Faraday Lectureship winner, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
Who is the credited producer for the Silent Hill 2 Original Soundtrack released in 2001?
----------
  A: Gozo Kitao
  B: Masashi Tsuboyama
  C: Takaharu Ikeda
  D: Akira Yamaoka
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Silent Hill 2 Original Soundtrack producer from 2001.

What I know:
- Silent Hill 2 is a famous survival horror game from 2001
- Akira Yamaoka is strongly associated with Silent Hill music - he composed the soundtracks for multiple Silent Hill games
- Yamaoka is well-known as the series' composer and sound designer

However, the question asks specifically about the "credited producer" of the soundtrack release, not the composer. While Yamaoka composed the music, the producer credit on a soundtrack album release could potentially be different.

That said, Akira Yamaoka typically served in multiple roles for Silent Hill soundtracks, often being both composer and producer. The other names listed (Gozo Kitao, Masashi Tsuboyama, Takaharu Ikeda) are less commonly associated with the music production side of Silent Hill.

I'm fairly confident that Akira Yamaoka (option D) is the answer, as he was the primary creative force behind Silent Hill's audio and typically received producer credits on the soundtrack releases.

Confidence level: High (around 80-85%)

Given the point system (+1 for correct, -1 for incorrect, 0 for pass) and my high confidence level, answering is the better strategic choice.

Question:
What is the name of the documentary Ellen Kuzwayo was involved in with Betty Wolpert in 1982?
----------
  A: Awake from Mourning
  B: Rising from Shadows
  C: Breaking Through Silence
  D: Beyond the Darkness
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Ellen Kuzwayo and a 1982 documentary with Betty Wolpert.

This is a very specific historical question requiring knowledge of:
- Ellen Kuzwayo (a South African anti-apartheid activist and writer)
- Betty Wolpert (a filmmaker)
- A specific documentary from 1982

I don't have confident knowledge of this specific documentary collaboration. While I know Ellen Kuzwayo was an important figure in South African history, I cannot reliably recall the exact title of this 1982 documentary. The options provided don't trigger strong recognition, and guessing would give me only a 25% chance of success with a 75% chance of losing a point.

Given the risk-reward structure (-1 for wrong, +1 for right, 0 for pass) and my low confidence, passing is the strategically sound choice.

Question:
From which Louisiana university did former Belizean Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel earn his B.S. degree in physics?
----------
  A: Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge
  B: University of Louisiana, Lafayette
  C: Tulane University, New Orleans
  D: Loyola University, New Orleans
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Manuel Esquivel's educational background.

This is a very specific factual question about:
- A former Prime Minister of Belize (Manuel Esquivel)
- His undergraduate degree (B.S. in physics)
- The specific Louisiana university he attended

This is quite obscure information. While I may have some information about Manuel Esquivel, the specific detail about which Louisiana university he attended for his physics degree is not something I'm confident about. This is the type of biographical detail that would require precise knowledge, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

The question offers four Louisiana universities, but without strong confidence in the correct answer, this is essentially a guess with only a 25% chance of being correct if I don't know the answer.

Given:
- The obscurity of this specific biographical detail
- My lack of strong confidence in knowing the correct answer
- The penalty for being wrong (-1 point)
- The risk/reward ratio favors passing

Question:
Which scientist received the Penrose Medal before the year Preston Ercelle Cloud Jr. received his?
----------
  A: William Maurice Ewing
  B: Marshall Kay
  C: Francis J. Pettijohn
  D: Arthur L. Day
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider whether I can confidently answer this question about the Penrose Medal recipients.

This question requires me to know:
1. When Preston Ercelle Cloud Jr. received the Penrose Medal
2. When each of the other scientists listed received it
3. Which one received it before Cloud

This is a very specific question about the chronological order of Penrose Medal recipients in geology. While I have some general knowledge about scientific awards, the exact years when specific individuals received the Penrose Medal is highly specialized historical information that I'm not confident I have accurate knowledge of.

Without being certain of the specific years, attempting to answer would be a guess, and the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Which U.S. president was the last one to be born in the 18th century?
----------
  A: James Buchanan
  B: Millard Fillmore
  C: Franklin Pierce
  D: Zachary Taylor
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to think about which U.S. president was the last born in the 18th century (before 1800).

Let me consider the birth years of these presidents:
- James Buchanan: born 1791
- Millard Fillmore: born 1800
- Franklin Pierce: born 1804
- Zachary Taylor: born 1784

Wait, let me reconsider. The 18th century ended on December 31, 1800. So anyone born in 1800 or earlier would be born in the 18th century.

If Millard Fillmore was born in 1800, that would still be the 18th century. But I need to verify - was he born in 1800 or 1801? I believe Fillmore was born in January 1800, which would make him 18th century.

However, the question asks for the LAST president born in the 18th century - meaning the most recent one chronologically who was still born before 1801.

Between Buchanan (1791) and Fillmore (1800), Fillmore would be later. But I'm not entirely certain about Fillmore's exact birth year.

This is a factual question where I have some uncertainty about the precise dates. Given the risk of losing a point versus gaining one, and my moderate confidence level, I should be cautious.

Question:
What is the full name of the Indian politician who is quoted comparing Kashmir's Martyrs' Day with the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre?
----------
  A: Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah
  B: Mirza Afzal Beg
  C: Syed Mir Qasim
  D: Ghulam Mohammad Sadiq
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about an Indian politician who compared Kashmir's Martyrs' Day with the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.

This is a very specific historical question requiring knowledge of:
1. Kashmir's Martyrs' Day (July 13, 1931)
2. The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre (1919)
3. Which specific politician made this comparison in a quote

While I have general knowledge about these historical events, I'm not confident about which specific politician made this particular comparison. This requires precise historical knowledge of quotes and attributions. The options given are all significant Kashmiri political figures, but without certainty about who specifically made this comparison, there's a significant risk of getting this wrong.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about the exact attribution of this quote, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
What town in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, was Kenjiro Shoda born in?
----------
  A: Tatebayashi
  B: Isesaki
  C: Maebashi

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Kenjiro Shoda's birthplace in Gunma Prefecture, Japan.

This is a very specific biographical fact about a person named Kenjiro Shoda. Without knowing who this person is or having reliable information about their birthplace, I would essentially be guessing among four towns in Gunma Prefecture.

The question requires specific historical/biographical knowledge that I'm not confident I possess accurately. Guessing would give me only a 25% chance of being correct, which means an expected value of: 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = -0.5 points.

This is clearly unfavorable compared to passing (0 points).

Whose painting was purchased by Peter Arrell Browne Widener in 1911 for just over half a million USD?
----------
  A: Rubens
  B: Rembrandt
  C: Van Dyck
  D: Vermeer
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about a specific art purchase by Peter Arrell Browne Widener in 1911.

This is a very specific historical question requiring knowledge of:
1. Peter Arrell Browne Widener's art purchases
2. The specific year 1911
3. The price point of just over half a million USD

While I know Widener was a major art collector and that half a million USD in 1911 would be an enormous sum (equivalent to many millions today), I don't have confident, specific knowledge about which particular painting he purchased in that exact year at that exact price point. This is the kind of detailed art history fact that would require specialized knowledge.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

What is the name of the university from which Thabo Cecil Makgoba, Chancellor of the University of the Western Cape in South Africa since 2012, first graduated with a PhD degree in 2009?
----------
  A: University of Pretoria
  B: University of KwaZulu-Natal
  C: University of the Witwatersrand

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Thabo Cecil Makgoba's PhD.

This is a very specific factual question about:
- A specific person (Thabo Cecil Makgoba)
- A specific degree (PhD)
- A specific year (2009)
- A specific institution

I don't have reliable knowledge about where Thabo Makgoba obtained his PhD in 2009. This is quite specialized biographical information that would require specific knowledge of South African academic and religious leadership (he is an Anglican Archbishop). While I know he is associated with the University of the Western Cape as Chancellor, that doesn't tell me where he got his PhD.

Given that:
1. This requires very specific biographical knowledge
2. I cannot confidently recall this information
3. Getting it wrong costs me a point
4. The risk outweighs the potential reward

I should PASS on this question.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the population counts for two municipalities of Mitrovica according to the 2011 census.

This is a very specific factual question requiring precise knowledge of:
1. Which two municipalities of Mitrovica are being referenced (likely North and South Mitrovica in Kosovo)
2. The exact census data from 2011

This is highly specialized demographic data that I would need to have accurate knowledge of to answer correctly. While I have some general knowledge about Mitrovica being a divided city in Kosovo, I don't have high confidence in recalling the specific 2011 census figures for both municipalities combined or separately.

Given that:
- This requires very specific numerical data
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- I'm not confident in my knowledge of these exact census figures
- The risk outweighs the potential reward

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the first Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir.

This is a specific historical and political question about Indian administrative history. Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah was a prominent political leader in Jammu and Kashmir and played a crucial role in the region's early political development. He was indeed associated with the leadership of Jammu and Kashmir in its early years after India's independence.

I have reasonable confidence that Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah (Option A) was the first Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, as he was a key figure in the state's accession to India and its early governance.

Given my moderate to good confidence level on this question, I believe the potential gain outweighs the risk.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about Ghana's latitude coordinates.

Ghana is located in West Africa, along the Gulf of Guinea. I know it's in the Northern Hemisphere and relatively close to the equator. 

From my knowledge:
- Ghana's southernmost point is near the coast of the Gulf of Guinea
- Its northernmost point extends into the interior of West Africa
- The country spans roughly 8-10 degrees of latitude

Looking at the options:
- A: 4° and 12°N (8 degree span)
- B: 6° and 14°N (8 degree span)
- C: 3° and 11°N (8 degree span)
- D: 2° and 10°N (8 degree span)

I believe Ghana's coordinates are approximately between 4.5°N and 11°N. Option A (4° and 12°N) seems most consistent with this knowledge, as it captures the southern coastal region starting around 4-5°N and extends to about 11-12°N in the north.

I'm reasonably confident about this, though not absolutely certain.

Question:
What is the name of the recipient of the Dickson Prize in Medicine in 1996?
----------
  A: Susan Lindquist
  B: Elizabeth Blackburn
  C: Patricia Goldman-Rakic
  D: Philippa Marrack
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the 1996 Dickson Prize in Medicine recipient.

The Dickson Prize in Medicine is a prestigious award, but this is asking about a specific year (1996) and a specific recipient from among four accomplished scientists. This is a very specific factual question that requires precise knowledge of award history.

Let me consider what I know:
- All four options are distinguished scientists in their fields
- Susan Lindquist was known for protein folding research
- Elizabeth Blackburn won the Nobel Prize for telomere research
- Patricia Goldman-Rakic was a neuroscientist
- Philippa Marrack is an immunologist

However, I don't have confident, specific knowledge about who received the Dickson Prize in Medicine specifically in 1996. This is a narrow factual question where guessing has a 25% chance of success but a 75% chance of losing a point.

Given the risk-reward structure (lose 1 point for wrong answer, gain 1 point for correct answer, 0 points for passing), and my lack of confident knowledge about this specific award in this specific year, the expected value of guessing is negative.

Question:
What is the resolution of the Cat B15 Q in pixels?
----------
  A: 720 x 1280
  B: 540 x 960
  C: 320 x 480
  D: 480 x 800
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Cat B15 Q's screen resolution.

The Cat B15 Q is a rugged smartphone that I have some knowledge about, but this is a very specific technical specification. While I have general knowledge about various phone models, the exact pixel resolution of this particular model is a precise factual detail that I'm not highly confident about.

Looking at the options:
- 720 x 1280 (HD)
- 540 x 960 (qHD)
- 320 x 480 (HVGA)
- 480 x 800 (WVGA)

Without being certain of the exact specifications, guessing would give me only a 25% chance of being correct, which means a 75% chance of losing a point. The expected value of answering is: 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = -0.5 points.

Since I'm not confident enough about this specific technical detail, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
In which month and year did Apple add the ability for users to speak "Hey Siri" to enable the assistant without the requirement of physically handling the device?
----------
  A: October 2014
  B: March 2015
  C: September 2014.
  D: June 2015
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this specific technical/historical question about Apple's Siri feature.

This question asks about when the "Hey Siri" hands-free feature was introduced. This is a very specific date that requires precise knowledge of Apple's product announcements and iOS releases.

Let me think about what I know:
- "Hey Siri" hands-free functionality was introduced with iOS 8 or iOS 9
- iOS 8 was announced at WWDC in June 2014 and released in September 2014
- The hands-free "Hey Siri" feature (while plugged in) came with iOS 8
- Always-on "Hey Siri" came later with specific hardware

The options suggest dates in 2014-2015. I believe the hands-free "Hey Siri" feature was introduced with iOS 8 in September 2014, which would make option C the likely answer.

However, I'm not 100% certain about the exact month and year, and there's ambiguity about whether the question refers to the plugged-in version or the always-on version. This is a very specific factual question where I could easily be wrong about the exact timing.

Given the risk of losing a point and my uncertainty about the precise date, I should pass on this question.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the specific air date of the second episode of Season 2 of "What We Do in the Shadows."

This is a very specific factual question requiring exact knowledge of:
- The TV show "What We Do in the Shadows"
- Season 2's episode air dates
- Specifically the second episode's original air date

While I have some general knowledge about this show, I don't have reliable, precise information about the exact air date of this specific episode. This is the type of detailed factual information where I could easily be wrong, and the question provides four very similar dates in April-May 2020, making it easy to confuse.

Given:
- High specificity required
- Multiple plausible similar options
- Uncertainty about the exact date
- Risk of losing a point if wrong

The strategic choice is to pass rather than guess.

Question:
Who won the silver medal in men's individual foil fencing in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics?
----------
  A: Daniele Garozzo
  B: Alexander Massialas
  C: Enzo Lefort
  D: Alessio Foconi
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Tokyo 2020 Olympics men's individual foil fencing silver medalist.

This is a very specific factual question about a particular Olympic event. While I have some knowledge about Olympic fencing, the silver medal winner in a specific event from Tokyo 2020 is quite detailed information. I know that Cheung Ka Long from Hong Kong won gold in this event, but I'm less certain about the silver medalist.

Looking at the options:
- Daniele Garozzo (Italy) - won gold in Rio 2016
- Alexander Massialas (USA) - strong fencer, silver in Rio 2016
- Enzo Lefort (France) - French team member
- Alessio Foconi (Italy) - Italian fencer

I believe Daniele Garozzo won the silver medal in Tokyo 2020, but I'm not highly confident in this answer. Given the risk of losing a point if wrong versus gaining nothing by passing, and my moderate uncertainty, this is a borderline decision.

However, my confidence is not strong enough to justify the risk.

Question:
In whose honor was the Leipzig 1877 tournament organized?
----------
  A: Howard Staunton
  B: Wilhelm Steinitz
  C: Paul Morphy
  D: Adolf Anderssen
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about a specific chess tournament from 1877.

The Leipzig 1877 tournament is a historical chess event. Let me think about what I know:
- This was a significant tournament in chess history
- The year 1877 and the phrasing "in whose honor" suggests it was a memorial tournament
- Adolf Anderssen was a famous German chess player who died in 1879, so a 1877 tournament wouldn't be in his memory yet
- Paul Morphy died in 1884, so not him either
- Howard Staunton died in 1874, which would make a 1877 memorial tournament possible
- Wilhelm Steinitz was alive and active in 1877

Given the timing and that memorial tournaments were common in chess history, and that Staunton died in 1874, a tournament in 1877 could plausibly be in his honor. However, I'm not certain about this specific historical detail.

My confidence level is moderate but not high - this is a very specific historical fact about a tournament from nearly 150 years ago. The risk of losing a point seems significant.

This is a very specific biographical detail about a particular architect. I don't have reliable information about Eleanor Manning O'Connor's educational background, specifically which high school she attended. This is the type of obscure factual question where guessing would have only a 25% chance of being correct, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given the specificity of this question and my lack of confident knowledge about this particular detail, the expected value of answering is negative.

This question asks about:
- KTCZ-FM transmitter location
- KMSP Tower on Ramby Avenue
- Which interstate is nearby

This is a very specific question about local geography in what appears to be the Minneapolis-St. Paul area (given the "MSP" in KMSP and the Minnesota interstate numbers). Without specific knowledge of:
1. Where Ramby Avenue is located
2. Where the KMSP Tower specifically sits
3. The exact proximity of interstates to this location

I would essentially be guessing among four plausible Minnesota interstates. This is highly specialized local knowledge that I'm not confident I have accurately.

The risk of losing a point (-1) versus the potential gain (+1) with low confidence makes this a poor bet.

1. A specific political controversy from 2016
2. The exact county and state involved
3. Details about local government responses to that tragedy

I don't have strong confidence in knowing which specific county took this stance. This is the type of obscure historical detail that would be easy to get wrong, and the question provides four specific options that all sound plausible. Without clear knowledge of this particular incident, I would essentially be guessing among the four choices.

- Pass = 0 points
- I lack confidence in this specific fact

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about the Mathematical Association of America David P. Robbins Prize winner in 2008.

This is a very specific factual question about a mathematical prize. The David P. Robbins Prize is awarded by the MAA for papers with a significant experimental component. While I have some knowledge about mathematical prizes and the mathematicians listed (all are prominent combinatorialists), I'm not certain about the specific winner in 2008.

The mathematicians listed are all well-known:
- Doron Zeilberger - known for experimental mathematics
- Richard Stanley - renowned combinatorialist
- Neil Sloane - creator of OEIS
- Herbert Wilf - combinatorics pioneer

Without being confident about the specific 2008 winner, guessing would give me only a 25% chance of being correct, which yields an expected value of: 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = -0.5 points.

Since I'm not confident enough to have better than random odds, passing is the better strategic choice.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about John B. Goodenough receiving the Welch Award in Chemistry.

John B. Goodenough was a renowned chemist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2019 for his work on lithium-ion batteries. However, the Welch Award in Chemistry is a specific award given by the Robert A. Welch Foundation, and I'm not certain about the exact year he received this particular award.

While I know Goodenough received numerous awards throughout his career, I don't have strong confidence about the specific year of the Welch Award. The options span from 2015 to 2021, and without being certain, guessing would be risky given the penalty for wrong answers.

Given the uncertainty and the risk of losing a point, I should pass on this question.

Question:
Who was the commencement speaker at Harvard in 2018?
----------
  A: John Lewis
  B: Michael Bloomberg
  C: Tim Cook
  D: Kamala Harris
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about who spoke at Harvard's 2018 commencement.

Let me think about what I know:
- Harvard commencement speakers are typically prominent figures
- 2018 is recent enough that I should have reliable information
- The options include John Lewis (civil rights leader), Michael Bloomberg (former NYC mayor/businessman), Tim Cook (Apple CEO), and Kamala Harris (then Senator, now VP)

I recall that Mark Zuckerberg spoke at Harvard in 2017. For 2018, I believe it was John Lewis, the civil rights icon and congressman, who gave the commencement address at Harvard.

However, I'm not entirely certain about this. There's a possibility I could be confusing years or institutions. Given that this is a specific factual question about a particular year and I have some uncertainty, the risk of losing a point is real.

But I do have a reasonably strong recollection that it was John Lewis in 2018. My confidence is moderate to moderately-high on this.

Given the game's scoring system (+1 for correct, -1 for incorrect, 0 for pass), I should answer if I'm more than 50% confident.

I assess my confidence at around 60-65%, which exceeds the threshold.

Question:
How many girls are in "Girls on the Bridge," Munch's painting from 1900 (in the version where some of them are looking at the river)?
----------
  A: Five
  B: Three
  C: Two
  D: Four
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this specific art history question.

"Girls on the Bridge" (or "The Girls on the Bridge") is indeed a famous painting by Edvard Munch that he created in multiple versions. The question specifies the 1900 version where some girls are looking at the river.

However, I'm not certain about the exact number of girls in that specific version. Munch created several versions of this painting between 1899-1935, and the number of figures can vary between versions. While I have some general knowledge about the painting, I cannot confidently recall whether the 1900 version specifically shows two, three, four, or five girls.

Given that:
- This is a very specific question about a particular version of a painting
- I'm not confident enough to distinguish between the options
- Getting it wrong would cost me a point
- The risk outweighs the potential reward

Question:
What is the initial name of the political party that Emmanuel Macron founded?
----------
  A: En Route!
  B: En Marche!
  C: En Mouvement!
  D: En Avant!
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Emmanuel Macron's political party.

I'm quite confident about this one. Emmanuel Macron founded a political party whose name translates to "On the Move!" or "Forward!" in English. The French name was "En Marche!" which he later renamed to "La République En Marche!" (often abbreviated as LREM or REM).

Looking at the options:
- A: En Route! - This means "On the way!" but this wasn't the name
- B: En Marche! - This means "On the Move!" and I'm confident this is correct
- C: En Mouvement! - This means "In Movement!" but this wasn't the name
- D: En Avant! - This means "Forward!" but this wasn't the name

I'm highly confident the answer is B: En Marche!

Question:
On which day, month, and year was the first race of the Two Oceans Marathon in Cape Town?
----------
  A: 15 April 1968
  B: 24 March 1971
  C: 7 June 1969
  D: 2 May 1970
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Two Oceans Marathon in Cape Town.

This is a very specific historical question requiring exact knowledge of the date of the first Two Oceans Marathon race. While I have some general knowledge about major marathons, I don't have high confidence in knowing the precise day, month, and year of this particular marathon's inaugural race.

The Two Oceans Marathon is a famous ultra-marathon in South Africa, but the exact date of its first race in the early 1970s is a specific factual detail that I'm not certain about. Given that:
- Getting it wrong costs me 1 point
- Passing costs me nothing
- I don't have strong confidence in any of the four options

The risk-reward calculation suggests I should pass on this question.

What was the affiliated institute of the winner of the Turing Award in 1968?
----------
  A: MIT Lincoln Laboratory

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the 1968 Turing Award winner.

The 1968 Turing Award was won by Richard Hamming. He is famous for his work on error-detecting and error-correcting codes (Hamming codes) and numerical methods. Richard Hamming spent most of his career at Bell Labs, where he did his most significant work.

I'm quite confident that the answer is B: Bell Labs.

Given my strong confidence in this answer, I should choose to ANSWER.

Question:
Which year was the drug Metformin introduced as a medication in France?
----------
  A: 1961
  B: 1964
  C: 1953
  D: 1957
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about when Metformin was introduced in France.

This is a very specific historical fact about pharmaceutical history. Metformin is a well-known diabetes medication, and I have some knowledge that it was developed from French lilac (Galega officinalis) and was indeed introduced in France before being adopted elsewhere. 

I believe Metformin was introduced in France in 1957, which would make the answer D. However, this is a precise historical date, and I could be confusing it with other dates in Metformin's history (like when it was introduced in other countries or when related compounds were developed).

Given that:
- This requires very specific historical knowledge
- The dates are all within a narrow range (1953-1964), suggesting they might all be plausible
- I have some knowledge but am not completely certain
- The penalty for being wrong (-1) equals the reward for being right (+1)

My confidence is moderate but not high enough to justify the risk given the equal penalty/reward structure.

Question:
How many CDs did the original Seiken Densetsu 3 soundtrack include?
----------
  A: 2
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 3

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Seiken Densetsu 3 (Secret of Mana 2) original soundtrack.

This is a very specific factual question about a video game soundtrack from 1995. Seiken Densetsu 3 was a Super Famicom game that wasn't released outside Japan until much later. The question asks about the number of CDs in the original soundtrack release.

This is highly specialized knowledge about:
- A specific game's soundtrack
- The exact format of its original release
- A detail that would only be known to collectors or dedicated fans

I don't have reliable confidence in knowing the exact number of CDs in the original soundtrack release. This could be 2, 3, or even 4 CDs depending on the release. Without certain knowledge of this specific detail, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

  A: Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird
  B: The Two Fridas.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Frida Kahlo's largest painting.

What I know:
- Frida Kahlo created many notable paintings
- "The Two Fridas" (Las Dos Fridas) is one of her most famous works and is notably large - approximately 5.7 × 5.7 feet (173 × 173 cm)
- Her other famous works like "Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird," "The Wounded Deer," and "The Broken Column" are generally smaller in scale
- "The Two Fridas" is specifically known as one of her largest paintings

I'm quite confident that "The Two Fridas" (option B) is her largest painting. This is a well-documented fact about her work.

Question:
Which 2016 IGN award did the TV series Hannibal not win?
----------
  A: Best TV Series
  B: Best Drama Series
  C: Best Adapted Series
  D: Best Thriller Series
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the TV series Hannibal and the 2016 IGN awards.

This is a very specific question about:
1. A particular TV series (Hannibal)
2. A specific year (2016)
3. IGN awards (a gaming/entertainment media outlet)
4. Which award it did NOT win

This requires precise knowledge of IGN's 2016 awards and Hannibal's nominations/wins. Hannibal ended in 2015, so 2016 awards would likely be retrospective or the series wouldn't be eligible for many categories.

This is highly specialized trivia that I'm not confident about. I don't have reliable information about which specific IGN awards Hannibal won or didn't win in 2016. Getting this wrong would cost me a point, while passing costs me nothing.

Question:
What city was Richard Serra in when he created his work "To Lift"?
----------
  A: San Francisco
  B: Los Angeles

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this question regarding Richard Serra's work "To Lift."

Richard Serra is a famous sculptor known for his large-scale steel sculptures. "To Lift" is one of his early works from around 1967. This was part of his "Verb List" series where he explored actions like rolling, propping, and lifting with lead and other materials.

I believe "To Lift" was created in New York, where Serra was based in the late 1960s and was part of the downtown art scene. However, I'm not entirely certain about this specific detail - it could have been created in another city during this period.

Given that:
- This is a very specific factual question about art history
- I have some knowledge but am not completely certain
- The penalty for being wrong (-1) equals the reward for being right (+1)
- I should only answer when reasonably confident

My confidence level is moderate but not high enough to justify the risk.

  D: Alessio Figalli and Peter Kronheimer
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Salem Prize recipients.

The question asks about two scientists who received the Salem Prize after Akshay Venkatesh. To answer this correctly, I would need to know:
1. When Akshay Venkatesh received the Salem Prize
2. Who received it in the subsequent years
3. Which pair from the options matches those recipients

I have some knowledge that Akshay Venkatesh is a prominent mathematician who has won major prizes, but I'm not certain about the specific year he received the Salem Prize or the exact chronological order of all Salem Prize recipients. The Salem Prize is awarded to young researchers in analysis, and while I recognize several names in the options as distinguished mathematicians, I'm not confident about the precise timeline.

Given the specificity required (exact names and chronological order) and my uncertainty about these details, the risk of losing a point seems higher than my confidence in getting this right.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the architect of the Palace of Running Water in Buenos Aires.

Let me consider what I know:
- The "Palace of Running Water" (Palacio de Aguas Corrientes) is a famous building in Buenos Aires
- It's known for its ornate facade with terracotta decorations
- I have some uncertainty about the specific architect

Looking at the options:
- Alejandro Bustillo - known for other Argentine buildings
- Francisco Tamburini - worked on major Buenos Aires buildings
- Carlos Nyströmer - less familiar
- Eduardo Le Monnier - less familiar

I'm not highly confident about the specific architect of this building. While I have general knowledge about Argentine architecture, I cannot reliably distinguish between these architects for this specific building. The risk of losing a point seems to outweigh the potential gain given my uncertainty.

This is a very specific historical fact about how long Constable worked on a particular painting. While I know Constable was a famous English landscape painter, the exact number of years he spent on this specific work is quite detailed information. I don't have strong confidence in knowing the precise duration he worked on this painting.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

        Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, so consider how confident you are that you would get the question right before deciding to answer or pass.

Question:
What was the first and last name of the Swiss painter who murdered his landlady, Anne King?
----------
  A: François Lemoyne
  B: Théodore Gardelle
  C: Jean-Baptiste Greuze
  D: Antoine Watteau
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a Swiss painter who murdered his landlady Anne King.

This is a very specific historical question about a criminal case. Let me consider what I know:

- The question asks about a Swiss painter who murdered his landlady named Anne King
- The options are all 18th-century French/Swiss painters
- Théodore Gardelle was a Swiss miniaturist painter who was executed in London in 1761 for murdering his landlady, Anne King

I have specific knowledge about this case - Théodore Gardelle is indeed known for this crime. This is a factual historical event that I'm reasonably confident about.

However, I should consider:
- This is an obscure historical fact
- The consequences of being wrong (-1 point) vs passing (0 points)
- My actual confidence level

I believe I have reliable knowledge that Théodore Gardelle (option B) is the correct answer. This is a documented historical case from 1761 in London.

Given my confidence in this specific historical fact, I will answer.

Question:
In which Community episode is Evil Abed's first appearance? Please give the season, episode number, and title.
----------
  A: Season 2 Episode 14 "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons"
  B: Season 3 Episode 4 "Remedial Chaos Theory"
  C: Season 4 Episode 11 "Basic Human Anatomy"
  D: Season 3 Episode 22 "Introduction to Finality"
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this specific question regarding the TV show "Community" and Evil Abed's first appearance.

Evil Abed is a memorable character from Community, and I recall he's associated with the "darkest timeline" concept. This concept was introduced in "Remedial Chaos Theory" (Season 3, Episode 4), which is the famous episode with multiple timelines based on different dice rolls. The post-credits scene of that episode shows the "darkest timeline" where Evil Abed appears with a felt goatee.

While Evil Abed appears later in other episodes like "Introduction to Finality," his first appearance should be in "Remedial Chaos Theory."

I'm fairly confident about this answer being B.

Question:
What is the name of the person who discovered the minor planet named after Viktor Vasnetsov?
----------
  A: Lyudmila Karachkina
  B: Lyudmila Zhuravlyova
  C: Tamara Smirnova
  D: Nikolai Chernykh
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about who discovered the minor planet named after Viktor Vasnetsov.

This is a very specific question about:
1. Viktor Vasnetsov (a Russian artist)
2. A minor planet named after him
3. Who discovered that specific minor planet

This requires knowing:
- That there is a minor planet named after Vasnetsov
- The specific discoverer from among four Soviet/Russian astronomers

All four options are real Soviet astronomers who discovered minor planets, but I would need to know the specific discovery record for the minor planet named after Vasnetsov. This is extremely specialized astronomical history knowledge.

I do not have high confidence in this answer. While I might make an educated guess, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain given my uncertainty about this specific minor planet's discoverer.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Arvind Kejriwal's childhood cities.

This is a very specific biographical question about where Arvind Kejriwal spent most of his childhood. While I know he is an Indian politician and the Chief Minister of Delhi, I don't have reliable, detailed information about the specific three cities where he spent most of his childhood years. This is quite granular biographical information that would require specific knowledge of his early life.

Given that:
1. This is highly specific factual information
2. I'm not confident about the precise details of his childhood locations
3. Getting this wrong would cost me a point
4. The risk outweighs the potential reward given my uncertainty

Haddo House, designed by William Adam, contains a collection of 85 paintings by which artist?
----------
  A: David Allan

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Haddo House and its art collection.

This is a very specific question about:
- Haddo House (a specific building designed by William Adam)
- A collection of 85 paintings by a particular artist
- Four Scottish artists as options

This requires specialized knowledge about Scottish architecture, art history, and the specific contents of Haddo House. I don't have strong confidence in knowing which of these four Scottish artists has a collection of 85 paintings at Haddo House. This is quite obscure historical/cultural knowledge.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

----------
  A: Kevin Youkilis
  B: Jason Varitek
  C: Mike Lowell
  D: Dustin Pedroia
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a specific play from the 2007 World Series Game 1, inning 4.

This is an extremely specific historical sports question requiring detailed knowledge of:
- The exact 2007 World Series matchup (Boston Red Sox vs. Colorado Rockies)
- The specific inning (4th)
- The specific play (a double that scored two runs)
- Which player made that hit

While I know the Red Sox won the 2007 World Series and can recognize these as Red Sox players, I do not have reliable knowledge of the specific play-by-play details from inning 4 of Game 1. This level of granular sports trivia is beyond what I can confidently answer. Guessing would give me only a 25% chance of being correct, which results in negative expected value (-0.5 points).

The prudent decision is to pass on this question.

Question:
Which senator introduced the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves into the Senate?
----------
  A: James Turner
  B: Stephen R. Bradley

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about which senator introduced the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves into the Senate.

This is a very specific historical question about early 19th century U.S. legislation. The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves was passed in 1807 and took effect in 1808. This requires knowing not just general history, but the specific senator who introduced this particular piece of legislation.

While I know this was an important act that banned the international slave trade to the United States, I don't have strong confidence about which specific senator introduced it into the Senate. The names provided are all senators from that era, but I cannot reliably distinguish between them for this specific legislative action.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Which foreign merchant was issued the right to transact slaves on Spain's behalf and ordered regulations on trade with Cuba?
----------
  A: Casa de Contratación
  B: Asiento de Negros
  C: Consejo de Indias
  D: Real Compañía de Comercio
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Spanish colonial trade history.

The question asks about a foreign merchant given rights to transact slaves on Spain's behalf and who ordered regulations on trade with Cuba.

Let me consider the options:
- A: Casa de Contratación - This was a Spanish government agency that controlled trade with the Americas, not a foreign merchant
- B: Asiento de Negros - This was a contract/license system that granted foreign merchants (often British, French, or Dutch) the right to supply slaves to Spanish colonies
- C: Consejo de Indias - This was the Council of the Indies, a Spanish governing body, not a foreign merchant
- D: Real Compañía de Comercio - This was a Spanish royal trading company, not a foreign merchant

The key phrase is "foreign merchant" - the Asiento de Negros was specifically the system by which Spain contracted with foreign entities to supply slaves to its colonies, as Spain itself didn't have direct access to African slave sources.

I'm reasonably confident that B (Asiento de Negros) is the correct answer, as it's the only option that fits the description of involving foreign merchants in the slave trade on Spain's behalf.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Jerry Lee Lewis's 13th album on Mercury Records.

This is a very specific factual question requiring knowledge of:
1. Jerry Lee Lewis's discography
2. Which albums were released on Mercury Records specifically
3. The chronological order of those albums
4. The exact release year of the 13th one

This is extremely detailed music history trivia. I don't have reliable confidence in knowing the specific order of Jerry Lee Lewis's Mercury Records albums or which number album was released in which year. This would require specialized discography knowledge that I'm not certain about.

Given the high specificity and my uncertainty, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Who replaced Don Santos in the band group Immature?
----------
  A: Marcus "MDC" Houston
  B: Terrell "TLC" Crawford
  C: Brandon "BDK" Mitchell
  D: Kelton "LDB" Kessee
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the band Immature.

What I know:
- Immature was an R&B boy band from the 1990s
- The group had members including Marques "Batman" Houston, Jerome "Romeo" Jones, and Kelton "LDB" Kessee
- Don "Half Pint" Santos was an original member
- I believe Kelton "LDB" Kessee replaced Don Santos when he left the group

Looking at the options, option D mentions Kelton "LDB" Kessee, which aligns with my recollection. However, I'm not 100% certain about this music trivia detail, as it's quite specific to 1990s R&B group history.

My confidence level: Moderate (around 65-70%). I have a reasonable recollection but this is specialized music trivia and I could be misremembering.

Given that:
- Wrong answer = -1 point
- Pass = 0 points
- Right answer = +1 point

With ~65-70% confidence, the expected value is positive but not strongly so. This is a borderline case, but I'll go with my knowledge.

Question:
Which musician became Louis Armstrong's first teacher and chose him as the bandleader?
----------
  A: Bunk Johnson
  B: Peter Davis.
  C: Joe Oliver
  D: Buddy Bolden
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Louis Armstrong's first teacher and who chose him as bandleader.

Let me consider what I know:
- Louis Armstrong's early musical education in New Orleans
- Peter Davis was an instructor at the Colored Waif's Home where young Louis was sent
- Joe "King" Oliver was Armstrong's mentor and brought him to Chicago
- The question asks specifically about his "first teacher" who also "chose him as the bandleader"

Peter Davis taught Armstrong at the Colored Waif's Home for Boys and gave him leadership roles in the band there. This fits both criteria: first formal teacher and chose him as bandleader.

Joe Oliver was more of a mentor later, and while extremely important to Armstrong's career, he wasn't his first teacher.

I'm reasonably confident the answer is B: Peter Davis, as he was Armstrong's instructor at the Waif's Home and made him the bugler and eventually leader of the home's band.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about when Maryam Mirzakhani became a professor at Stanford University.

What I know:
- Maryam Mirzakhani was a brilliant Iranian mathematician
- She was the first woman to win the Fields Medal (in 2014)
- She worked at Stanford University
- She sadly passed away in 2017

However, I'm uncertain about the specific year she became a professor at Stanford. This is a very specific factual question requiring precise knowledge of her career timeline. While I know she was at Stanford, I don't have strong confidence about whether it was 2007, 2009, 2011, or 2013.

Given that:
- This requires precise biographical information
- I could lose a point if wrong
- I'm not confident enough to distinguish between these specific years

The strategic choice is to PASS rather than risk losing a point on uncertain information.

Question:
What is the name and surname of the former President of South Africa who received a state funeral when he died on January 4, 2007?
----------
  A: Mbeki
  B: Viljoen
  C: De Klerk
  D: Botha
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to think carefully about this question before deciding whether to answer or pass.

The question asks about a former President of South Africa who died on January 4, 2007, and received a state funeral.

Let me consider what I know:
- The date is very specific: January 4, 2007
- It must be a former president who received a state funeral
- The options are: Mbeki, Viljoen, De Klerk, and Botha

My knowledge:
- Thabo Mbeki was president from 1999-2008, so he was still alive and serving in 2007
- F.W. de Klerk served 1989-1994 and died in 2021
- Constand Viljoen was a military figure and politician but not a president
- P.W. Botha was president from 1984-1989

I believe P.W. Botha died on October 31, 2006, not January 4, 2007. However, I'm not entirely certain about the exact date.

Wait - I should reconsider. Could this be referring to a different Botha or am I misremembering the date? The specificity of January 4, 2007 makes me uncertain.

Given my uncertainty about the exact death date and the possibility I'm confusing details, I should be cautious. However, I'm fairly confident that among these options, Botha (D) is the most likely answer as he was a former president who died around this time period.

I'll answer, as I have reasonable confidence.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Heisuke Hironaka and when he established the Japan Association for Mathematical Sciences.

This is a very specific historical fact about a particular mathematician and a specific organization. While I know Heisuke Hironaka is a renowned Japanese mathematician who won the Fields Medal in 1970, I don't have reliable information about the exact year he established this particular philanthropic foundation.

This is the type of question where guessing would be risky - it's asking for a precise year among four options that are all plausible (spanning 1981-1990), and I don't have confident knowledge of the correct answer.

Given the risk of losing a point versus gaining nothing by passing, and my low confidence in knowing this specific fact, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
Who was awarded the John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science in 1994?
----------
  A: Marina Ratner
  B: Karen Uhlenbeck
  C: Joan Birman
  D: Dusa McDuff
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science in 1994.

This is a very specific factual question about a particular award recipient in a specific year. The John J. Carty Award is given by the National Academy of Sciences. All four options are distinguished mathematicians, which makes this particularly challenging.

Let me consider what I know:
- Marina Ratner was known for work in ergodic theory
- Karen Uhlenbeck is famous for geometric analysis
- Joan Birman is known for knot theory and braid theory
- Dusa McDuff is known for symplectic geometry

This is an extremely specific historical fact about a particular year's award recipient. Without certain knowledge of who received this award in 1994 specifically, I would essentially be guessing among four plausible candidates. The risk of losing a point is equal to the potential gain, and my confidence level is low on this precise factual detail.

Question:
What was the original name of the station "Carlos Gardel" on the Buenos Aires Subway?
----------
  A: Scalabrini Ortiz
  B: Medrano
  C: Pueyrredón
  D: Agüero
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Buenos Aires Subway station history.

This is a very specific factual question about the historical name of a subway station in Buenos Aires. The Carlos Gardel station is named after the famous tango singer, but I would need to know the specific history of Buenos Aires Subway station name changes to answer this correctly.

This is quite obscure knowledge that requires familiarity with:
1. Buenos Aires Subway system history
2. Specific station renaming events
3. The original name before it was changed to Carlos Gardel

I don't have strong confidence in knowing the correct answer to this question. It's the type of local historical detail that would require specific knowledge of Buenos Aires transit history. Guessing would give me only a 25% chance of being correct, and the penalty for being wrong (-1 point) equals the reward for being right (+1 point), making a guess with low confidence a poor strategic choice.

Question:
At what event in 2004 did David Hanson present K-Bot?
----------
  A: Consumer Electronics Show (CES)
  B: World Robot Conference (WRC)
  C: American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) conference.
  D: International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about David Hanson presenting K-Bot at an event in 2004.

Let me consider what I know:
- David Hanson is a robotics designer known for creating humanoid robots
- K-Bot was one of his early robotic creations
- The question asks about a specific 2004 event

I don't have strong, reliable knowledge about the specific event where K-Bot was presented in 2004. This is a very specific historical detail about a particular robot presentation. While I'm familiar with David Hanson's work in general, I cannot confidently recall which of these four conferences hosted the K-Bot presentation.

Given that:
1. This requires specific factual knowledge about a particular event
2. I don't have high confidence in any of the four options
3. Getting it wrong would cost me a point
4. The risk outweighs the potential reward

Question:
What is the name of the Japanese scientist who received the Shaw Prize in 2008?
----------
  A: Takaaki Kajita
  B: Shinya Yamanaka
  C: Makoto Kobayashi
  D: Satoshi Ōmura
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Shaw Prize in 2008.

The Shaw Prize is awarded in three categories: Astronomy, Life Science and Medicine, and Mathematical Sciences. In 2008, there were multiple laureates across these categories.

Let me consider what I know about each option:
- Takaaki Kajita: Known for neutrino physics, won Nobel Prize in 2015
- Shinya Yamanaka: Known for induced pluripotent stem cells, won Nobel Prize in 2012
- Makoto Kobayashi: Particle physicist, won Nobel Prize in 2008
- Satoshi Ōmura: Known for work on parasitic diseases, won Nobel Prize in 2015

I'm not highly confident about the specific Shaw Prize winners in 2008. While I have some knowledge of these scientists' achievements, I cannot reliably recall which one specifically received the Shaw Prize in that year. The Shaw Prize is less widely publicized than the Nobel Prize, making this a challenging factual question.

Given the penalty for wrong answers and my uncertainty about this specific fact, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What year did Doris Salcedo get the Rolf Schock Prize in Visual Arts for the first time?
----------
  A: 2015
  B: 2019
  C: 2013
  D: 2017
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about when Doris Salcedo received the Rolf Schock Prize in Visual Arts.

Doris Salcedo is a Colombian artist known for her politically charged sculptures and installations. The Rolf Schock Prizes are prestigious awards given in several categories including Visual Arts.

I have some uncertainty about the exact year she received this prize. While I believe it was in the 2010s based on the options given, I'm not highly confident about pinpointing the specific year among these four choices (2013, 2015, 2017, or 2019).

Given that:
- This is a very specific factual question about a particular award year
- I'm not certain enough to distinguish confidently between these options
- Getting it wrong would cost me a point
- The risk outweighs the potential reward given my uncertainty

  B: November 3, 2016
  C: July 10, 2017
  D: September 22, 2017
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about when Miranda Lambert's album "The Weight of These Wings" was certified platinum in the U.S.

This is a very specific factual question requiring exact knowledge of:
1. A specific album by Miranda Lambert
2. The exact date (day, month, and year) of its platinum certification

I don't have reliable knowledge of this specific certification date. This is the kind of detailed music industry information that would require access to RIAA certification records or similar sources. While I know Miranda Lambert is a country music artist, I cannot confidently recall the specific certification date for this particular album.

Given the specificity required and my lack of confidence in knowing the exact date, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
What position did Ghulam Ishaq Khan, former Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, hold until 1955 at the Provincial Secretariat of the North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)?
----------
  A: secretary of the irrigation department
  B: secretary of the public works department
  C: secretary of the finance department
  D: secretary of the agriculture department
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Ghulam Ishaq Khan's early career position.

This is a very specific historical question about a particular individual's career before 1955 in what was then the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. Ghulam Ishaq Khan later became President of Pakistan (1988-1993) and was indeed Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, but the question asks about his much earlier provincial government position.

This requires detailed knowledge of:
1. Ghulam Ishaq Khan's early career trajectory
2. Specific positions he held in the 1940s-1950s
3. The administrative structure of NWFP at that time

While I know he had a distinguished career in finance and administration, I don't have high confidence about the specific departmental secretary position he held at the Provincial Secretariat before 1955. This is the kind of detailed biographical fact that would require specific historical knowledge.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my low confidence in knowing this specific detail, the rational choice is to pass.

Question:
What doctrine did Ketanji Brown Jackson use to uphold her decision that "the suits should be brought in Malaysia, not the U.S."?
----------
  A: act of state doctrine
  B: comity of nations
  C: res judicata
  D: forum non conveniens
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a legal doctrine used by Ketanji Brown Jackson in a specific case involving Malaysia.

This question requires:
1. Knowledge of a specific case involving Justice Jackson
2. Understanding of the legal doctrine she applied
3. Recognition that the case involved jurisdiction and venue (suits in Malaysia vs. U.S.)

The phrase "suits should be brought in Malaysia, not the U.S." strongly suggests this is about forum selection - where a case should be heard. The doctrine of "forum non conveniens" (option D) is specifically used to dismiss cases when another forum (country or court) would be more appropriate or convenient.

However, I'm not certain about:
- The specific case being referenced
- Whether this was from her time as a district court judge or circuit court judge
- The exact doctrine she cited

While "forum non conveniens" seems like the most logical answer given the context, I cannot be certain this is the correct answer without knowing the specific case. The other options (act of state doctrine, comity of nations, res judicata) are less likely given the context, but I lack confidence in my knowledge of this particular case.

Given the uncertainty about the specific case and my inability to verify the correct answer, I should pass.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Susan Lucci's 1999 Emmy presentation.

Susan Lucci famously won her first Daytime Emmy in 1999 after 18 previous nominations, which was a major television moment. I recall that Shemar Moore presented her with the award, as he was her co-star on "All My Children" at the time. This was a particularly memorable moment in Emmy history.

I'm reasonably confident about this answer being D: Shemar Moore.

Who was the 2018 ACM Eugene L. Lawler Award recipient?
----------
  A: Rajeev Motwani
  B: Arvind Narayanan
  C: Meenakshi Balakrishnan

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the 2018 ACM Eugene L. Lawler Award recipient.

The Eugene L. Lawler Award is given by ACM for humanitarian contributions within computer science. This is a very specific factual question about a particular year's award recipient.

Let me consider what I know:
- This is a specialized award in computer science
- I would need to know the specific recipient for 2018
- The options include notable computer scientists, but I'm not certain which one received this specific award in this specific year

This is a precise factual question where I either know the answer or I don't. I don't have strong confidence about the 2018 recipient of this particular award. Getting this wrong would cost me a point, while passing costs me nothing.

Given my uncertainty about this specific award recipient in this specific year, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
Which religion is the third largest among Singaporean residents based on the 2020 census?
----------
  A: Buddhism
  B: Hinduism
  C: Islam
  D: Christianity
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about Singapore's religious demographics from the 2020 census.

What I know about Singapore's religious composition:
- Singapore is a multi-religious society
- Buddhism and Christianity are among the largest religions
- There are significant Muslim and Hindu populations
- The typical ranking is usually Buddhism (largest), followed by Christianity or Islam, with Hinduism also significant

However, I'm not certain about the exact ranking from the 2020 census specifically. The question asks for the "third largest" which requires precise knowledge of the census data. Without being certain of the exact order, this is risky.

Given the uncertainty about the specific 2020 census rankings and the penalty for wrong answers, I should pass on this question.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about FPT University's founding date.

FPT University is a Vietnamese university, and this question asks for a very specific date. While I have some general knowledge about FPT University being established in the mid-2000s in Vietnam, I'm not highly confident about the exact day, month, and year from the given options.

The options are all clustered around 2005-2007, which aligns with my general timeframe knowledge, but distinguishing between these specific dates requires precise factual knowledge that I'm uncertain about.

Given that:
- Wrong answer = -1 point
- Pass = 0 points
- Correct answer = +1 point
- My confidence level is low on the exact date

The risk-reward calculation suggests I should pass rather than guess.

Question:
What year is 2024 in the Discordian calendar?
----------
  A: 3188 YOLD
  B: 3185 YOLD
  C: 3190 YOLD
  D: 3192 YOLD
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Discordian calendar.

The Discordian calendar is from the parody religion Discordianism. I recall that it uses "YOLD" (Year of Our Lady of Discord) and adds 1166 to the Gregorian calendar year.

If 2024 + 1166 = 3190, then the answer would be C: 3190 YOLD.

However, I'm not entirely certain about this conversion rule. While I have some knowledge of Discordianism as a parody religion created in the 1960s, the specific calendar conversion is a niche detail that I could be misremembering.

Given:
- This is relatively obscure knowledge
- I have moderate but not high confidence in the +1166 conversion
- The penalty for being wrong equals the reward for being right
- There are 4 options, so even educated guessing has risk

I should be conservative here since my confidence is not high enough to justify the risk.

Question:
Which sculptor designed the Order of the Liberator General San Martín?
----------
  A: Roberto Francisco López Martínez
  B: Miguel Ángel Sánchez Fernández
  C: Carlos Eduardo Rovira Mendoza
  D: Ángel Eusebio Ibarra García
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about who designed the Order of the Liberator General San Martín.

This is a very specific question about a South American honor/decoration. The Order of the Liberator General San Martín is an Argentine order of merit. However, I don't have reliable knowledge about which specific sculptor designed this order, and the names provided all appear to be Spanish/Latin American names that could plausibly be correct.

Given that:
1. This is highly specialized knowledge about a specific decorative order
2. I cannot confidently distinguish between these four options
3. Getting it wrong would cost me a point
4. I have no strong basis for selecting any particular answer

The risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain, especially since my confidence level is very low.

Question:
What was the first band Robbie Robertson joined that formed in '56?
----------
  A: The Suedes and the Crowns
  B: The Hawks and the Rebels
  C: Little Caesar and the Consuls
  D: Johnny and the Hurricanes
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Robbie Robertson's early musical career.

Robbie Robertson is famously known for being part of The Band, but this question asks about his first band that formed in 1956. He would have been quite young then (born in 1943, so about 13 years old in 1956).

Looking at the options:
- The Suedes is mentioned, which I believe was indeed one of his very early groups
- The Hawks later became associated with Ronnie Hawkins and eventually evolved into The Band
- I'm less certain about the other options

However, I'm not highly confident about the specific details of which exact band formed in 1956 and whether it was "The Suedes" or if the answer involves one of the other combinations listed. This is a very specific historical detail about early rock and roll history.

Given the specificity of the question (requiring knowledge of the exact year 1956 and the first band) and my moderate uncertainty, this seems like a risky question where I could easily lose a point.

Question:
Who created Ida Mntwana's bronze statue?
----------
  A: Elena Cartwright
  B: Margaret Davidson
  C: Sarah Lovejoy
  D: Patricia Thornton
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about who created Ida Mntwana's bronze statue.

Let me consider what I know:
- I'm being asked about a specific bronze statue of someone named Ida Mntwana
- I need to identify the sculptor from four options
- I don't have reliable information about Ida Mntwana or their bronze statue in my training data
- The names provided (Elena Cartwright, Margaret Davidson, Sarah Lovejoy, Patricia Thornton) don't immediately connect to any sculptor I'm confident about in relation to this work

Since I don't have confident knowledge about this specific statue and its creator, attempting to answer would essentially be guessing among four options (25% chance). Given the scoring system where a wrong answer costs me a point and passing costs nothing, the expected value of guessing is negative.

What was the complete name of the college in Delhi in which Ashraf Abbasi, the first Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan, studied?
----------
  A: Lady Willingdon Medical College
  B: Sir Ganga Ram Medical College
  C: Lady Irwin Medical College
  D: Lady Hardinge Medical College
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Ashraf Abbasi's educational background.

This is a very specific historical question requiring knowledge of:
1. Who Ashraf Abbasi was (first Deputy Speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly)
2. Where he studied in Delhi
3. The complete name of that specific college

This is an obscure biographical detail about a Pakistani political figure from the early post-independence period. I don't have reliable knowledge about Ashraf Abbasi's educational background or which specific college in Delhi he attended. The options are all medical colleges in Delhi, but I cannot confidently determine which one is correct.

Given the specificity of this question and my lack of confidence in knowing the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Which architect built the Palace of Justice of the Argentine Nation?
----------
  A: Norbert Maillart.
  B: Eduardo Le Monnier
  C: René Sergent
  D: Alejandro Christophersen
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the architect of the Palace of Justice of the Argentine Nation.

This is a very specific question about Argentine architectural history. The Palace of Justice (Palacio de Justicia) is located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

Looking at the options:
- Norbert Maillart - French architect
- Eduardo Le Monnier - This name sounds familiar in Argentine architecture context
- René Sergent - French architect
- Alejandro Christophersen - Norwegian-Argentine architect who worked extensively in Argentina

I have some knowledge that Alejandro Christophersen was a prominent architect in Argentina in the late 19th/early 20th century, but I'm not certain he designed the Palace of Justice specifically. I also recall that Norbert Maillart was involved in some Argentine projects.

However, I'm not sufficiently confident about which specific architect designed this particular building. This is a very specific factual question where I could easily be wrong, and the penalty for being wrong (-1) equals the reward for being right (+1).

Given my uncertainty, the expected value of answering is negative or at best neutral.

Which scientists received the American Chemical Society Award in Pure Chemistry in 1937?
----------
  A: Gilbert N. Lewis
  B: Harold C. Urey
  C: E. Bright Wilson
  D: Linus Pauling
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the American Chemical Society Award in Pure Chemistry from 1937.

This is a very specific historical question about a particular award in a particular year. Let me consider what I know:

- Gilbert N. Lewis was a prominent chemist known for Lewis structures and acids/bases
- Harold C. Urey won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934 for discovering deuterium
- E. Bright Wilson was a physical chemist
- Linus Pauling was a highly decorated chemist who won multiple awards

However, I don't have reliable specific knowledge about who received this particular ACS award in this specific year (1937). This is a very precise factual question that would require detailed historical records to answer confidently. While I recognize these are all prominent chemists from that era, I cannot confidently identify which one received this specific award in 1937.

Given the risk of losing a point if wrong versus gaining nothing by passing, and my low confidence in this specific historical fact, I should pass.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the founding year of Girardota, Antioquia, Colombia.

This is a very specific historical question about a municipality in Colombia. I don't have reliable knowledge about the exact founding year of Girardota. This is the type of factual question where guessing would give me only a 25% chance of being correct (1 in 4 options), and the penalty for being wrong (-1 point) equals the reward for being right (+1 point).

Given that:
- I lack specific knowledge about this municipality's founding date
- The expected value of guessing is negative or neutral at best
- I have no strong basis to eliminate any options

The rational choice is to pass.

Question:
What is the chemical name of the drug previously known to treat bacterial infections that Dr. William Schwartz discovered also acts as a diuretic in people with congestive heart failure?
----------
  A: Sulfanilamide.
  B: Penicillin
  C: Streptomycin
  D: Chloramphenicol
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about medical history.

This question asks about a specific historical discovery by Dr. William Schwartz regarding a bacterial infection treatment that was found to have diuretic properties for congestive heart failure patients.

Let me consider what I know:
- This sounds like it's referring to the discovery of sulfonamide drugs (sulfa drugs) and their unexpected diuretic effects
- Sulfanilamide was indeed one of the early sulfonamide antibiotics
- The discovery that certain sulfonamides had diuretic properties led to the development of modern diuretic medications
- This historical connection between sulfonamides and diuretics is well-documented

However, I'm not entirely certain about:
- Whether Dr. William Schwartz was specifically the person who made this discovery
- Whether sulfanilamide specifically was the drug in question (vs. other sulfonamides)

The other options (Penicillin, Streptomycin, Chloramphenicol) don't have the same historical connection to diuretic discovery that I'm aware of.

Given that this is a very specific historical/medical question with proper names and specific drug discoveries, and I have some uncertainty about the exact details, this represents moderate risk. However, the connection between sulfonamides and diuretic discovery is strong enough that I have reasonable confidence.

My confidence level: Moderate (around 65-70%)

Given the point system (+1 for correct, -1 for incorrect, 0 for pass), this is borderline, but I'll proceed cautiously.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the State Hermitage Museum's gallery space square footage.

This is a very specific factual question requiring precise knowledge of the Hermitage Museum's dimensions. While I know the Hermitage is one of the largest museums in the world located in St. Petersburg, Russia, I don't have reliable confidence in the exact square footage of its gallery space. This is the type of highly specific numerical data that would require precise sourcing.

The numbers provided are all plausible for a major museum, and without strong knowledge of this specific metric, I would essentially be guessing among the options.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my low confidence in knowing this specific measurement, the rational choice is to pass.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Kathleen McNulty Mauchly Antonelli's father's first name.

Kathleen McNulty Mauchly Antonelli was one of the original ENIAC programmers, but this question asks about a very specific biographical detail - her father's first name. This is an extremely specific piece of genealogical information that would require detailed knowledge of her family history.

I don't have reliable information about her father's first name stored in my knowledge base. This is the kind of obscure biographical detail that I would likely get wrong if I guessed, even though common Irish names are provided as options.

Given the high specificity of this question and my lack of confidence in knowing this particular detail, the strategic choice is to pass rather than risk losing a point.

This is a very specific factual question about Indian art history. While I know Jamini Roy was an important Indian painter known for his folk art style, I don't have strong confidence about the exact year he received the Padma Bhushan. This is the type of precise historical detail that requires specific knowledge, and I could easily be off by a few years.

Given that:
- This is a specific date that I'm not certain about
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- The risk-reward ratio doesn't favor guessing on such specific historical facts
- I have moderate uncertainty about the exact year

Question:
In what year did Kristin Otto retire from swimming?
----------
  A: 1990
  B: 1989

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about Kristin Otto's retirement from swimming.

Kristin Otto was an East German swimmer who was very successful in the 1980s, particularly at the 1988 Seoul Olympics where she won six gold medals. However, I'm not certain about the exact year she retired. Given that the 1988 Olympics were her peak and considering the political changes in East Germany around 1989-1990, she likely retired around that time period. The options span 1987-1991.

Since I'm not highly confident about the specific retirement year and this is a factual question where I could easily be wrong, the risk of losing a point seems significant.

Question:
What castle overlooked Carmel Glen and its burn and was situated in Knockentiber, East Ayrshire?
----------
  A: Busbie Castle
  B: Glencairn Castle
  C: Knockentiber Castle
  D: Carmel Castle
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a castle in Knockentiber, East Ayrshire that overlooked Carmel Glen.

This is a very specific historical and geographical question about Scottish castles. The question mentions:
- A castle overlooking Carmel Glen and its burn
- Located in Knockentiber, East Ayrshire

Looking at the options:
- Busbie Castle
- Glencairn Castle
- Knockentiber Castle
- Carmel Castle

The most logical answer would seem to be either Knockentiber Castle (matching the location) or Carmel Castle (matching Carmel Glen). However, this is highly specialized local Scottish history that I'm not confident about. I don't have strong knowledge of the specific castles in this area of East Ayrshire or which one specifically overlooked Carmel Glen.

Given my uncertainty about this specific historical detail, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Who is known to be the first Indian musician to perform at the United Nations General Assembly in 1966?
----------
  A: Madurai Shanmukhavadivu Subbulakshmi
  B: Kishori Amonkar Mogubai Kurdikar
  C: Dagar Vani Gayaki Ustad Nasir Moinuddin
  D: Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Indian music history.

This question asks about a specific historical event - the first Indian musician to perform at the UN General Assembly in 1966. This is a very specific factual question.

Let me consider what I know:
- M.S. Subbulakshmi (option A) was a legendary Carnatic vocalist who was highly acclaimed and performed internationally
- She was known for breaking barriers and performing at prestigious venues
- I have strong associations between M.S. Subbulakshmi and historic performances at the United Nations
- The other options are also notable musicians but I don't have strong associations with them and UN performances

I'm quite confident that M.S. Subbulakshmi was indeed the first Indian musician to perform at the UN General Assembly in 1966. This is a well-documented historical fact that aligns with my knowledge of her pioneering role in Indian classical music.

My confidence level is high enough to answer this question.

Question:
What type of eclipse occurred on August 28, 1802, at 51.3°N, 105.7°E?
----------
  A: Annular solar eclipse
  B: Partial solar eclipse
  C: Hybrid solar eclipse
  D: Total solar eclipse
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a specific historical eclipse.

This question asks about a very specific eclipse that occurred on August 28, 1802, at precise coordinates (51.3°N, 105.7°E - which is in Siberia/Russia). 

To answer this correctly, I would need:
1. Access to historical eclipse data from 1802
2. Knowledge of the specific type of eclipse at those exact coordinates

This is an extremely specific historical astronomical question. I don't have reliable access to detailed eclipse records from 1802, and the type of eclipse can vary by location even for the same event. Without access to historical eclipse databases or catalogs, I cannot confidently determine whether this was annular, partial, hybrid, or total at that specific location.

This is a factual question with a definitive answer, but I lack the specific historical data needed to answer it reliably. The risk of losing a point is high.

Question:
Who did Richard Neutra design the Elkay Apartments for?
----------
  A: Louis Kievman
  B: Edgar Kaufmann
  C: Philip Lovell
  D: John Entenza
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this question regarding Richard Neutra and the Elkay Apartments.

Richard Neutra was a prominent modernist architect. I'm familiar with some of his major works like the Lovell Health House (for Philip Lovell) and the Kaufmann Desert House (for Edgar Kaufmann). However, I'm not certain about the Elkay Apartments specifically. The name "Elkay" doesn't immediately trigger strong associations with any of these clients in my knowledge.

Given that:
- I know Neutra did work for Lovell and Kaufmann on other projects
- I'm not confident about the specific client for the Elkay Apartments
- Getting this wrong would cost me a point
- The risk outweighs the potential reward given my uncertainty

In what year did Nikolai Andreev win the Leelavati Award?
----------
  A: 2024
  B: 2018

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about when Nikolai Andreev won the Leelavati Award.

The Leelavati Award is given by the International Mathematical Union for outstanding contributions to public outreach in mathematics. However, I don't have reliable information about Nikolai Andreev winning this award or the specific year it occurred.

This is a very specific factual question about an award winner and year. Without confident knowledge of this information, attempting to answer would be essentially guessing among four options, giving me only a 25% chance of being correct. The expected value of guessing would be: 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = -0.5 points.

Since I'm not confident about this answer and the expected value of guessing is negative, I should pass.

Question:
Which school did Lyndon B. Johnson briefly teach in Pearsall?
----------
  A: Pearsall Middle School
  B: Cotulla Elementary School
  C: Welhausen Elementary School
  D: Pearsall High School
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Lyndon B. Johnson's teaching history.

What I know:
- LBJ did teach early in his career in Texas
- He famously taught at a school with Mexican-American students, which was a formative experience
- I recall he taught in Cotulla, Texas at Welhausen Elementary School
- The question asks about Pearsall specifically, which is a different location

The question is asking about Pearsall, not Cotulla. While I'm confident about his time at Welhausen Elementary in Cotulla, I'm less certain about whether he taught in Pearsall at all, or if he did, which specific school. This could be a detail I'm not familiar with, or it could be testing whether I know the difference between his teaching locations.

Given the uncertainty about the Pearsall connection specifically, and the risk of confusing locations, my confidence is not high enough to justify risking a point.

Question:
Who wrote the music for the Romanian anthem?
----------
  A: Anton Pann
  B: Ciprian Porumbescu
  C: George Enescu
  D: Dimitrie Cantemir
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about the Romanian national anthem's composer.

The Romanian national anthem is "Deșteaptă-te, române!" (Awaken thee, Romanian!). I have some knowledge that this anthem's music was composed by Anton Pann in the 19th century. However, I'm not entirely certain about this, as Ciprian Porumbescu is also a well-known Romanian composer from that era who wrote patriotic music.

Given that:
- I have a reasonable belief it's Anton Pann (option A)
- But there's some uncertainty, particularly with Ciprian Porumbescu as another option
- The penalty for being wrong (-1) equals the reward for being right (+1)

This is a moderate confidence situation. I believe I know the answer, but I'm not completely certain. Given the symmetric payoff structure, I should answer if I'm more than 50% confident.

I assess my confidence at around 65-70% that it's Anton Pann.

Question:
In which month and year did the UN General Assembly unanimously elect Maurice Strong to be the first head of the UN Environment?
----------
  A: November 1972
  B: January 1973
  C: December 1972
  D: October 1972
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Maurice Strong's election as the first head of the UN Environment Programme.

What I know:
- The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) was established following the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment
- Maurice Strong was indeed the first Executive Director of UNEP
- The Stockholm Conference took place in June 1972
- UNEP was formally established later in 1972

However, I'm uncertain about the exact month of the UN General Assembly vote. The options are all in late 1972 or early 1973 (October, November, December 1972, or January 1973). While I believe it was likely in December 1972 (as the UN General Assembly resolution establishing UNEP was passed on December 15, 1972), I'm not completely certain whether Strong was elected in that same resolution or in a subsequent vote.

Given that:
- This is a very specific historical detail (exact month and year)
- I have some knowledge but am not fully confident
- The penalty for wrong answers equals the reward for correct answers
- Multiple plausible options exist

This is a moderate-risk question where my uncertainty is significant enough that I should be cautious.

Question:
What was the name of India's first-ever cricket team?
----------
  A: Oriental Cricket Club
  B: Royal Bengal Cricket Club
  C: Madras Cricket Association
  D: Bombay Cricket Club
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about India's first-ever cricket team.

This is a very specific historical question about Indian cricket. While I have some knowledge about cricket history, the exact name of India's "first-ever" cricket team is quite specific and could be interpreted in different ways (first club? first national team? first organized team?).

Looking at the options:
- Oriental Cricket Club - This sounds plausible as an early name
- Royal Bengal Cricket Club - Could be historical
- Madras Cricket Association - This sounds more like an organizing body
- Bombay Cricket Club - Also sounds plausible for an early club

I'm not highly confident about which specific organization was definitively the "first-ever" cricket team in India. This is the type of detailed historical fact where I could easily be wrong, and the penalty for being wrong (-1) equals the reward for being right (+1).

Given my uncertainty on this specific historical detail, the risk-reward doesn't favor answering.

What is the first and last name of the sculptor who created the statue of Christopher Codrington at All Souls College?
----------
  A: Sir John Bacon
  B: Sir Henry Cheere
  C: Sir William Kent

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the sculptor of Christopher Codrington's statue at All Souls College, Oxford.

This is a very specific question about:
- A particular statue (Christopher Codrington)
- At a specific location (All Souls College)
- Requiring knowledge of the sculptor's name

Christopher Codrington was a benefactor of All Souls College, Oxford. However, I'm not certain about which specific sculptor created his statue. The options given are all notable British sculptors from different periods:
- Sir John Bacon (1740-1799)
- Sir Henry Cheere (1703-1781)
- Sir William Kent (1685-1748) - primarily an architect
- Sir Francis Chantrey (1781-1841)

I don't have strong confidence in identifying the correct sculptor for this specific statue. This is quite specialized art history knowledge, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given my uncertainty and the risk of losing a point, the prudent choice is to pass.

Which power project in Jammu and Kashmir is located on the Suru River?
----------
  A: Kiru Hydroelectric Plant
  B: Pakal Dul Hydroelectric Plant
  C: Nimoo Bazgo Hydroelectric Plant
  D: Chutak Hydroelectric Plant
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about a hydroelectric project in Jammu and Kashmir on the Suru River.

Let me think about what I know:
- The Suru River is located in the Kargil district of Ladakh (formerly part of Jammu and Kashmir)
- I have some knowledge of hydroelectric projects in this region
- Chutak Hydroelectric Plant is one I recall being associated with the Suru River in the Kargil area

However, I'm not entirely certain about this answer. The other options are also real projects in the region:
- Kiru is on the Chenab River
- Pakal Dul is also on the Chenab River
- Nimoo Bazgo is on the Indus River

While I have a reasonable belief that Chutak is on the Suru River, I'm not completely confident in this answer. This is a very specific factual question about regional infrastructure, and there's a meaningful chance I could be wrong.

Given the penalty for wrong answers equals the reward for right answers, I should only answer if I'm more than 50% confident. I'd estimate my confidence at around 60-70%, which makes this a borderline case.

Given the modest confidence level and the specific nature of the question, I'll choose to answer since I do have a reasonable basis for my answer.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Dick Drago's age at death.

Dick Drago was an American relief pitcher, but this is a very specific factual question about when he died and at what age. This requires precise biographical knowledge that I'm not confident I have accurately. Without being certain of the correct answer, and given that wrong answers lose a point while passing costs nothing, the strategic choice is clear.

Question:
Name the enzyme that has an enzyme commission number of 3.1.4.2.
----------
  A: Glycerophosphoserine phosphodiesterase
  B: Phosphatidylcholine phospholipase
  C: Phosphatidylinositol phosphodiesterase
  D: Glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about enzyme commission (EC) number 3.1.4.2.

Let me think about what I know:
- EC numbers classify enzymes by their function
- The format is EC X.Y.Z.W where each number indicates the type of reaction
- EC 3 = hydrolases
- EC 3.1 = esterases (acting on ester bonds)
- EC 3.1.4 = phosphoric diester hydrolases

EC 3.1.4.2 specifically refers to glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase (also known as glycerophosphocholine cholinephosphodiesterase), which hydrolyzes glycerophosphocholine.

Looking at the options, option D matches this: Glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase.

I'm reasonably confident about this answer, as I can recall that EC 3.1.4.2 is associated with glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase.

Question:
In what year was the Logic Theorist computer program written?
----------
  A: 1958
  B: 1952
  C: 1960
  D: 1956.
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Logic Theorist computer program.

The Logic Theorist is a historically significant program in AI history. From my knowledge, it was created by Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Cliff Shaw. This was one of the first AI programs and is considered a landmark in artificial intelligence history.

I believe the Logic Theorist was written in 1956, which would be option D. This timing aligns with it being presented at the Dartmouth Conference, which is often considered the founding event of AI as a field.

I have reasonably high confidence in this answer - 1956 is a well-documented date for this important milestone in computer science history.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about J.C. Leyendecker and a 1897 painting exhibition.

What I know about J.C. Leyendecker:
- He was a famous American illustrator, particularly known for his work with The Saturday Evening Post
- He was active in the early 20th century
- He studied art in Paris at the Académie Julian in the 1890s

Given that he was studying in Paris in the 1890s and the question asks about 1897, it's plausible he exhibited at a Paris-based exhibition. The Paris Salon and Salon Champs de Mars were both prominent Paris exhibitions during that period. The Salon Champs de Mars was a breakaway salon founded in 1890.

However, I'm not certain about the specific exhibition in 1897. This is a very specific historical detail about a particular year early in his career. While I can make educated guesses based on his Paris connection, I don't have strong confidence in knowing the exact answer.

Given the risk of losing a point versus gaining nothing by passing, and my moderate-to-low confidence level on this specific detail:

Question:
What year was the municipality of Hispania, Antioquia, Colombia, founded?
----------
  A: 1932
  B: 1911
  C: 1918
  D: 1925
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about when Hispania, Antioquia, Colombia was founded.

This is a very specific historical question about a small municipality in Colombia. I don't have reliable knowledge about the founding date of Hispania, Antioquia. This is the type of obscure local administrative history that would require specific research or local knowledge.

Given that:
- This is highly specific factual information
- I have no strong basis to choose between the four options (1911, 1918, 1925, or 1932)
- Guessing would give me only a 25% chance of being correct
- The expected value of guessing is: 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = -0.5 points

The rational choice is to PASS.

Question:
What was the Word of the Decade (2010–2019) according to the American Dialect Society?
----------
  A: them
  B: we
  C: they
  D: me
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the American Dialect Society's Word of the Decade for 2010-2019.

This is a very specific factual question about a particular organization's decision. The American Dialect Society does make these pronouncements, and I recall that in recent years there has been significant attention to singular "they" as a gender-neutral pronoun. The options given are all pronouns, which suggests this is related to pronoun usage trends.

I have a strong recollection that "they" (used as a singular pronoun) was indeed selected as the Word of the Decade by the American Dialect Society for 2010-2019, reflecting its increased acceptance and usage as a gender-neutral singular pronoun.

However, this is a very specific factual claim that I could be misremembering or confusing with other word-of-the-year announcements from different organizations or time periods.

Given the specificity required and the penalty for being wrong, I'd estimate my confidence at around 75-80%. This is above the threshold where answering makes mathematical sense (need >50% confidence for positive expected value), but it's not certain.

I'll answer this question.

Question:
How many half-siblings did Louis Moreau Gottschalk have?
----------
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 7
  D: 5
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about Louis Moreau Gottschalk's half-siblings.

Louis Moreau Gottschalk was a 19th-century American composer and pianist. This is a very specific biographical detail about his family structure. While I have some general knowledge about Gottschalk, the exact number of half-siblings is quite specific and not something I'm confident about. This type of detailed family information could easily be misremembered or confused.

Given that:
- This is highly specific biographical trivia
- I'm not confident in my knowledge of this particular detail
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- Passing costs me nothing

The risk-reward calculation suggests I should pass on this question.

Question:
Which mathematician received the Chern Medal in 2022?
----------
  A: Terence Tao
  B: Jacob Lurie
  C: Barry Mazur
  D: Claire Voisin
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about who received the Chern Medal in 2022.

The Chern Medal is awarded every four years at the International Congress of Mathematicians. Let me think about what I know:

- The 2022 ICM was scheduled for St. Petersburg but was held virtually due to the situation in Russia
- I have some uncertainty about the specific 2022 Chern Medal recipient
- The options include very prominent mathematicians: Terence Tao (Fields Medalist, extremely prolific), Jacob Lurie (major work in higher category theory), Barry Mazur (number theory), and Claire Voisin (algebraic geometry)

I'm not highly confident about the specific 2022 recipient. While I have general knowledge about these mathematicians and the Chern Medal, this is a very specific factual question about a recent award, and I could easily be wrong about which of these distinguished mathematicians received it in that particular year.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the gain for correct answers (+1 point), and my moderate-to-low confidence on this specific fact, the expected value suggests I should pass.

What is the name of the city and state where Václav Hlavatý, a Czech-American mathematician, died?
----------
  A: Berkeley, California
  B: Cambridge, Massachusetts
  C: Princeton, New Jersey
  D: Bloomington, Indiana
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about Václav Hlavatý's death location.

What I know:
- Václav Hlavatý was a Czech-American mathematician
- This is a very specific biographical fact about where he died

This is a highly specific historical/biographical question that requires precise knowledge. I don't have confident knowledge about where Václav Hlavatý died. While I know he was associated with Indiana University Bloomington for much of his career in the United States, I cannot be certain about the specific city and state where he died without risking an incorrect guess.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my lack of confident knowledge about this specific fact, the rational choice is to pass.

Question:
What trophy was won on October 12, 2019, by Kaizer Chiefs Football Club?
----------
  A: The Telkom Knockout Cup
  B: The Nedbank Cup
  C: The Shell Ultra Helix Cup.
  D: The MTN 8 Cup
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a specific trophy won by Kaizer Chiefs Football Club on October 12, 2019.

This is a very specific factual question requiring knowledge of:
1. A particular South African football club
2. A specific date (October 12, 2019)
3. Which trophy they won on that exact date

While I have some general knowledge about South African football and that Kaizer Chiefs is a major club, I don't have reliable specific information about what trophy they won on this exact date. This is the type of detailed sporting event information that would require precise factual knowledge.

The options listed are all real South African football competitions, but without certainty about which one was won on that specific date, guessing would be risky given the penalty for wrong answers.

Given the high specificity required and my uncertainty, the strategic choice is to pass rather than risk losing a point.

Question:
In what year was Valery Matveevich Panov awarded the Lenin Prize?
----------
  A: 1965
  B: 1967

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Valery Matveevich Panov and the Lenin Prize.

Valery Panov was a Soviet ballet dancer, but I don't have reliable specific knowledge about when he received the Lenin Prize. This is a very specific historical fact about a particular award year, and I'm not confident in my knowledge of this detail. The question provides four specific years in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but I cannot reliably distinguish which is correct.

Given that:
- This requires precise factual knowledge
- I'm uncertain about the specific year
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- Passing costs me nothing

The strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What were the year and month the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first RSV vaccines?
----------
  A: May 2023.
  B: January 2024
  C: March 2023
  D: September 2022
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about FDA approval of RSV vaccines.

This is a very specific factual question about a recent regulatory event. RSV vaccines are relatively new developments, and the question asks for the exact year and month of FDA approval for the "first" RSV vaccines.

From my knowledge, the first RSV vaccines for older adults were approved by the FDA in 2023. I believe this occurred in May 2023, when the FDA approved GSK's Arexvy, making it the first RSV vaccine approved for older adults. Pfizer's Abrysvo followed shortly after.

Looking at the options:
- A: May 2023 - This aligns with my recollection
- B: January 2024 - This seems too late
- C: March 2023 - This seems slightly early
- D: September 2022 - This seems too early

I'm fairly confident that May 2023 is correct, as this was a significant milestone in vaccine development that received considerable attention.

Given my reasonable confidence in this answer, I'll choose to answer.

Question:
What year was Kiyosi Ito appointed to the Cabinet Statistics Bureau?
----------
  A: 1939
  B: 1937
  C: 1941
  D: 1935
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about Kiyosi Itô (the mathematician famous for Itô calculus).

This is a very specific biographical detail about when Itô was appointed to the Cabinet Statistics Bureau of Japan. While I know Itô was an important Japanese mathematician who worked on stochastic processes, I'm not confident about the exact year of this particular appointment. This is the kind of specific historical detail that would require precise knowledge of his biography.

Given that:
- This is a very specific date that I'm uncertain about
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- The risk-reward ratio doesn't favor guessing on such specific biographical information

I should pass on this question.
