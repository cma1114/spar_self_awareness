Game Setup Prompt: 
        Let's play a game. Success at this game requires using intropsection to inform decision-making. I'm going to show you a series of challenging questions. For each question, after seeing it, you can choose to ANSWER or PASS.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question: if you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point.
        If you select PASS, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
        Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, so consider how confident you are that you would get the question right before deciding to answer or pass.

Question:
Which of the three Olympic fencing weapons was the last one to transition to using electrical equipment?
----------
  A: Foil
  B: Rapier
  C: Épée
  D: Sabre
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about Olympic fencing weapons.

Let me think through what I know:
- The three Olympic fencing weapons are foil, épée, and sabre
- Rapier is not an Olympic fencing weapon, so option B is incorrect
- Electrical scoring equipment was adopted at different times for each weapon
- Épée was the first to use electrical equipment (1930s)
- Foil adopted electrical equipment second (1950s)
- Sabre was the last to transition to electrical equipment (late 1980s/early 1990s)

I'm quite confident that sabre (option D) was the last weapon to transition to electrical equipment. The answer cannot be rapier since it's not an Olympic weapon.

I have strong confidence in this answer.

Question:
Which scientist received the Penrose Medal after the year Hollis Dow Hedberg received his?
----------
  A: James Gilluly
  B: Arthur Newell Strahler
  C: William C. Krumbein
  D: John Rodgers
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to determine when Hollis Dow Hedberg received the Penrose Medal, then identify which of these scientists received it after that year.

This is a very specific question about the Penrose Medal recipients and their chronological order. The Penrose Medal is awarded by the Geological Society of America. Without access to the exact timeline of when Hedberg received this medal and when each of these other geologists received theirs, I would be guessing.

This requires precise historical knowledge about:
1. The year Hedberg received the Penrose Medal
2. The years each of the four options received it
3. Which one came after Hedberg's

Given that this is highly specialized information about geological society awards and I'm not confident in my knowledge of the specific years these awards were given, attempting to answer would be risky.

Question:
On what date did the last total lunar eclipse for three years occur?
----------
  A: September 15, 2022
  B: December 4, 2022
  C: October 26, 2022
  D: November 8, 2022
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the date of the last total lunar eclipse before a three-year gap.

This is a very specific factual question about a recent astronomical event. The question asks about "the last total lunar eclipse for three years," which implies there was a total lunar eclipse followed by a three-year period without one.

I have some knowledge that there was a total lunar eclipse in November 2022, and I believe the next total lunar eclipse visible from Earth wasn't until 2025, creating roughly a three-year gap. The date November 8, 2022 seems correct for this event.

However, this is a precise date question where I could easily be off by days or confuse it with other lunar events. The consequences of being wrong (-1 point) equal the reward for being right (+1 point), so I should only answer if I'm more than 50% confident.

Given my reasonable confidence that November 8, 2022 (option D) is correct, and that this aligns with the three-year gap mentioned, I'll answer.

Question:
Which U.S. president was the last one to be born in the 18th century?
----------
  A: James Buchanan
  B: Millard Fillmore
  C: Franklin Pierce
  D: Zachary Taylor
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to think about which U.S. president was the last born in the 18th century (before 1800).

Let me consider the birth years of these presidents:
- James Buchanan: born 1791
- Millard Fillmore: born 1800
- Franklin Pierce: born 1804
- Zachary Taylor: born 1784

The 18th century ended on December 31, 1799. So anyone born in 1800 or later was born in the 19th century.

Between Buchanan (1791) and Taylor (1784), Buchanan was born later, making him the last president born in the 18th century among all U.S. presidents.

I'm confident in this answer.

Question:
What is the name of the university from which Thabo Cecil Makgoba, Chancellor of the University of the Western Cape in South Africa since 2012, first graduated with a PhD degree in 2009?
----------
  A: University of Pretoria
  B: University of KwaZulu-Natal
  C: University of the Witwatersrand
  D: University of Cape Town
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Thabo Cecil Makgoba's PhD.

This is a very specific factual question about:
- A specific person (Thabo Cecil Makgoba)
- A specific degree (PhD)
- A specific year (2009)
- A specific institution

I don't have reliable knowledge about where Thabo Makgoba obtained his PhD in 2009. This is a detailed biographical fact that would require specific knowledge of his academic history. While I know he is the Archbishop of Cape Town and Chancellor of the University of the Western Cape, I'm not confident about the specific institution where he earned his PhD.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

        Let's play a game. Success at this game requires using intropsection to inform decision-making. I'm going to show you a series of challenging questions. For each question, after seeing it, you can choose to ANSWER or PASS.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question: if you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point.
        If you select PASS, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
        Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, so consider how confident you are that you would get the question right before deciding to answer or pass.

Question:
Between which two latitudes does Ghana lie?
----------
  A: 4° and 12°N
  B: 6° and 14°N
  C: 3° and 11°N
  D: 2° and 10°N
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in knowing Ghana's latitude range.

Ghana is located in West Africa, south of the Sahel region. I know it's in the Northern Hemisphere and relatively close to the equator. The country extends from the Atlantic coast northward.

Looking at the options:
- A: 4° and 12°N
- B: 6° and 14°N  
- C: 3° and 11°N
- D: 2° and 10°N

I recall that Ghana's southernmost point (on the Atlantic coast) is around 4-5°N, and its northernmost point is around 11°N. This would make option A (4° and 12°N) or C (3° and 11°N) most likely.

However, I'm not completely certain of the exact boundaries. This is specific geographical knowledge that requires precision. Given the penalty for wrong answers equals the reward for correct answers, I should only answer if I'm quite confident.

My confidence level is moderate but not high enough given the stakes.

Question:
What are the names of the two scientists who received the Salem Prize after the year Akshay Venkatesh received his?
----------
  A: Peter Scholze and Maryna Viazovska
  B: Terence Tao and Ben Green
  C: Bo'az Klartag and Assaf Naor
  D: Alessio Figalli and Peter Kronheimer
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Salem Prize recipients.

The question asks about two scientists who received the Salem Prize after Akshay Venkatesh. To answer this correctly, I would need to know:
1. When Akshay Venkatesh received the Salem Prize
2. Who received it in the subsequent years
3. Which pair from the options matches those recipients

I have some knowledge that Akshay Venkatesh is a prominent mathematician who has won major awards, but I'm not certain about the specific year he received the Salem Prize or the exact chronological order of all Salem Prize recipients. The Salem Prize is awarded to young researchers in analysis, and while I recognize several names in the options as distinguished mathematicians, I'm not confident about the precise timeline.

Given the specificity required (exact names and chronological order) and my uncertainty about these details, the risk of losing a point seems higher than the potential gain.
