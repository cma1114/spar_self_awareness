Question:
What are the names of the two mathematicians who received the Salem Prize in 1988?
----------
  A: Alexander Volberg, Jean-Christophe Yoccoz
  B: Jean Bourgain, Christopher Sogge
  C: Terence Tao, Wilhelm Schlag
  D: Peter Sarnak, Thomas Wolff
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Salem Prize recipients in 1988.

The Salem Prize is a prestigious mathematics award given to young researchers in analysis. This is a very specific historical question requiring exact knowledge of who won in a particular year.

Let me consider what I know:
- The Salem Prize has been awarded since 1968
- It's given for outstanding contributions to analysis
- The names listed are all prominent mathematicians

However, this requires precise historical knowledge about a specific year (1988). Without being certain of the exact recipients in that particular year, guessing among four options gives me only a 25% chance of being correct if I'm unsure.

The risk-reward calculation:
- If I guess and I'm right: +1 point
- If I guess and I'm wrong: -1 point  
- If I pass: 0 points

Given that I'm not confident about the specific 1988 recipients, and the expected value of a random guess would be negative (0.25 × 1 + 0.75 × (-1) = -0.5), I should pass on this question.

Question:
What is the name of the man who succeeded Gösta Mittag-Leffler as a professor of mathematics at Stockholm University in July 1911?
----------
  A: Ivar Otto Bendixson
  B: Lars Edvard Phragmén
  C: Torsten Carleman
  D: Niels Fabian Helge von Koch
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about who succeeded Gösta Mittag-Leffler as a professor of mathematics at Stockholm University in July 1911.

This is a very specific historical question about Swedish mathematics. While I know Mittag-Leffler was an important Swedish mathematician, the exact succession details in 1911 are quite obscure. All four options are Swedish mathematicians from roughly the right era:

- Ivar Otto Bendixson (1861-1935)
- Lars Edvard Phragmén (1863-1937)
- Torsten Carleman (1892-1949) - seems too young for 1911
- Helge von Koch (1870-1924)

Carleman would have been only 19 in 1911, so unlikely. However, I'm not confident enough about the specific succession details to risk losing a point on this highly specialized historical question.

Question:
How many total lunar eclipses were there in 1982?
----------
  A: 3
  B: 1
  C: 4
  D: 2
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the number of total lunar eclipses in 1982.

This is a very specific astronomical fact about a particular year. While I have some knowledge about lunar eclipses, the exact number of total lunar eclipses in a specific year like 1982 is quite precise historical data that I'm not certain about.

Lunar eclipses can occur 0-3 times per year, and total lunar eclipses are less frequent than partial ones. Without being certain of the specific data for 1982, this would be a guess among the four options provided.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact answer, the risk of losing a point seems higher than the potential gain.

Question:
What was the Word of the Decade (2000–2009) according to the American Dialect Society?
----------
  A: tweet
  B: blog
  C: Facebook
  D: Google
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the American Dialect Society's Word of the Decade for 2000-2009.

Let me think about the options:
- Tweet: Twitter launched in 2006, but "tweet" became more prominent in the 2010s
- Blog: This was very significant in the 2000s
- Facebook: Launched in 2004, became huge in the 2000s
- Google: As a verb ("to google"), this became ubiquitous in the 2000s

The American Dialect Society chose their Word of the Decade for 2000-2009. "Google" as a verb was extremely influential and transformative during this period, becoming synonymous with internet searching. This seems like the most likely answer, though "blog" was also very significant.

I have reasonable confidence in "Google" being the answer, as it represented a major linguistic shift where a brand name became a common verb.

Question:
Which Indian cricketer has been appointed UNICEF and Cricket for Good Ambassador for the ICC Women’s World Cup 2017?
----------
  A: Rahul Dravid
  B: Sachin Tendulkar
  C: Virat Kohli
  D: MS Dhoni
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about an Indian cricketer appointed as UNICEF and Cricket for Good Ambassador for the ICC Women's World Cup 2017.

This is a very specific factual question about a particular appointment. The key details are:
- UNICEF and Cricket for Good Ambassador
- ICC Women's World Cup 2017
- Indian cricketer

All four options listed are male cricketers, which is notable given this is about the Women's World Cup. Sachin Tendulkar has been involved in various UNICEF initiatives and ambassadorial roles. However, I'm not certain about this specific appointment for the 2017 Women's World Cup.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact answer, the risk of losing a point seems higher than the potential gain.

Question:
In which episode and season of South Park does Aunt Jemima first appear? Give me the number and title.
----------
  A: Episode 4: Weight Gain 4000, Season one
  B: Episode 2: Gluten Free Ebola, Season eighteen
  C: Episode 7: Red Hot Catholic Love, Season six
  D: Episode 11: Casa Bonita, Season seven
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about South Park.

This is asking about a very specific detail - when Aunt Jemima first appeared in South Park, including both the episode number and title. This is quite obscure trivia that requires detailed knowledge of the show's history.

While I have some general knowledge about South Park, I'm not confident about the specific first appearance of Aunt Jemima in the series. This is the kind of detailed trivia that could easily trip me up, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Who was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive?
----------
  A: Albrecht Dürer
  B: Leonardo da Vinci
  C: Michelangelo Buonarroti
  D: Raphael Sanzio
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about art history.

This question asks about the first Western artist to have a biography published during their lifetime. This is a specific historical fact about Renaissance art history.

I know that Giorgio Vasari wrote "Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects" which included biographies of many Renaissance artists. Michelangelo was indeed alive when Vasari published the first edition in 1550, and Vasari even published a second edition in 1568 while Michelangelo was still living (he died in 1564, but the biography was updated). This was quite unusual for the time - to have a biography published while the subject was still alive.

However, I should consider whether any of the other artists might have had earlier biographies. Dürer died in 1528, Leonardo in 1519, and Raphael in 1520 - all before Vasari's work. The question is whether any of them had biographies published during their lifetimes.

I'm fairly confident that Michelangelo is the answer, as this is a well-known fact about him being the first artist to have a biography published while alive, particularly through Vasari's work.

My confidence level is moderately high on this question.

Question:
At the time of his birth, what was the name of the town in which the former Prime Minister of Poland Kazimierz Władysław Bartel was born?
----------
  A: Prague
  B: Vienna
  C: Lemberg.
  D: Krakow
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about Kazimierz Bartel's birthplace.

This is a very specific historical question requiring knowledge of:
1. Who Kazimierz Bartel was (former Polish Prime Minister)
2. Where he was born
3. What that town was called at the time of his birth (which could differ from its current name)

The options suggest cities that have had different names throughout history due to changing political boundaries in Central/Eastern Europe. "Lemberg" is the German name for what is now Lviv (Ukraine), which was historically part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and later Poland.

While I have some historical knowledge, this is a very specific factual question about a historical figure's birthplace and its historical name. The detail required (the name "at the time of his birth") makes this particularly challenging, as it requires knowing not just where he was born but also the geopolitical context of that time.

Given the specificity of this question and the potential for error, my confidence is not high enough to justify risking a point.

Question:
What day, month, and year did Jovian become a Roman emperor?
----------
  A: 12 August 362
  B: 27 June 363
  C: 15 March 361
  D: 3 September 364
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about when Jovian became Roman emperor.

Jovian was a Roman emperor who ruled briefly after Julian the Apostate. Julian died in June 363 during a campaign against Persia, and Jovian was proclaimed emperor immediately afterward by the army. This would have been in late June 363.

Looking at the options:
- A: 12 August 362 - Too early, Julian was still emperor
- B: 27 June 363 - This aligns with Julian's death in June 363
- C: 15 March 361 - This is closer to when Julian became emperor
- D: 3 September 364 - Too late, Jovian died in early 364

I'm fairly confident the answer is B: 27 June 363.

Question:
What day, month, and year did Lothair I, King of Italy, become King of Middle Francia?
----------
  A: 7 December 841
  B: 10 August 843
  C: 15 September 840
  D: 23 June 845
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this historical question about Lothair I becoming King of Middle Francia.

This is a very specific historical question about medieval European history. Lothair I was indeed King of Italy and later received Middle Francia through the Treaty of Verdun in 843, which divided the Carolingian Empire among the three sons of Louis the Pious.

The Treaty of Verdun was signed in August 843, and option B states "10 August 843," which aligns with the historical treaty that created Middle Francia as Lothair's kingdom.

However, this is an extremely specific date question, and while I'm fairly confident about the year (843) and the general timeframe (Treaty of Verdun), pinpointing the exact day is challenging. Historical records from this period can be imprecise.

Given the specificity required and some uncertainty about the exact date, this is a moderate-risk question. But option B does align well with what I know about the Treaty of Verdun.

I'll answer this question as I have reasonable confidence.

Question:
Which of the three Olympic fencing weapons was the last one to transition to using electrical equipment?
----------
  A: Foil
  B: Rapier
  C: Épée
  D: Sabre
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about Olympic fencing weapons.

The three Olympic fencing weapons are foil, épée, and sabre. (Note: rapier is not an Olympic weapon, so option B is incorrect.)

From my knowledge:
- Épée was the first to use electrical scoring (1930s)
- Foil adopted electrical scoring next (1950s)
- Sabre was the last to transition to electrical scoring (1980s/1990s)

I'm quite confident that sabre (option D) was the last weapon to transition to electrical equipment, as it was the most difficult to implement due to the complexity of detecting valid touches with a slashing weapon.

Question:
Who won the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Computer and Cognitive Science in 2003?
----------
  A: Allen Newell
  B: John McCarthy
  C: Herbert Simon
  D: Marvin Minsky
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Computer and Cognitive Science in 2003.

This is a very specific factual question about an award recipient in a particular year. While I have some knowledge about prominent computer scientists and cognitive scientists, the Benjamin Franklin Medal has multiple categories and has been awarded to many individuals over the years. The specific year 2003 makes this quite precise.

Looking at the options:
- Allen Newell (died 1992, so couldn't receive it in 2003)
- John McCarthy
- Herbert Simon (died 2001, so couldn't receive it in 2003)
- Marvin Minsky

This eliminates two options, but I'm not sufficiently confident about which of the remaining candidates (McCarthy or Minsky) received this specific award in this specific year. This is the type of precise historical fact where I could easily be wrong.

Given the risk of losing a point versus gaining one, and my lack of strong confidence in the answer, I should pass.

Question:
How many biological children did Isadora Duncan have?
----------
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 3
  D: 4
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about Isadora Duncan's biological children.

Isadora Duncan was a famous American dancer and choreographer from the early 20th century. I recall that she had a tragic life, including the loss of children in a drowning accident. I believe she had 2 biological children - a daughter (Deirdre) and a son (Patrick) - who both died in 1913 when the car they were in rolled into the Seine River in Paris.

I'm reasonably confident the answer is B: 2.

Question:
What was the name of the pre-2000s band with which the author of *Batman R.I.P.* toured and recorded?
----------
  A: The Blenders
  B: The Mixers
  C: The Shifters
  D: The Faders
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question.

The question asks about the author of *Batman R.I.P.* and their pre-2000s band. *Batman R.I.P.* was written by Grant Morrison, a Scottish comic book writer. I recall that Grant Morrison was involved in music and had a band, but I'm not entirely certain of the specific band name from the options provided.

Looking at the options (The Blenders, The Mixers, The Shifters, The Faders), I believe Grant Morrison's band was called The Mixers, but I'm not completely confident in this answer. There's a reasonable chance I could be confusing details or misremembering.

Given the uncertainty and the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point), versus the reward for correct answers (+1 point), I should only answer if I'm quite confident. Since I have some doubt about this specific detail, the safer choice is to pass.

Question:
What was the name of the composer of the opening theme song for the radio program "The American Album of Familiar Music"?
----------
  A: George Wilbur Meyer
  B: Raymond Hubbell Scott
  C: Walter Gustave "Gus" Haenschen
  D: William Grant Still
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the composer of the opening theme for "The American Album of Familiar Music."

This is a very specific question about a historical radio program. "The American Album of Familiar Music" was a long-running radio program, but the question asks specifically about the composer of its opening theme song.

Looking at the options:
- George Wilbur Meyer was a Tin Pan Alley composer
- Raymond Scott (the middle name "Hubbell" seems odd) was known for jazz and commercial music
- Walter Gustave "Gus" Haenschen was a conductor and arranger who worked extensively in radio
- William Grant Still was a classical composer

Gus Haenschen was indeed heavily involved in radio music and conducted for various radio programs. However, I'm not certain enough about the specific opening theme composer for this particular show to risk losing a point.

This is quite obscure trivia, and I don't have strong confidence in any particular answer.

  A: The Making of a Senator: Dan Quayle
  B: The Emergence of a Senate Leader: Pete Domenici
  C: Home Style: House Members in Their Districts
  D: Congress at the Grassroots: Representational Change in the South
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about Richard F. Fenno Jr. and the D.B. Hardeman Prize.

Richard F. Fenno Jr. is a well-known political scientist who studied Congress, but I'm not certain which specific work won him the D.B. Hardeman Prize. The D.B. Hardeman Prize is awarded for the best book about Congress.

Looking at the options:
- "Home Style" is one of his most famous works
- "The Making of a Senator: Dan Quayle" and "The Emergence of a Senate Leader: Pete Domenici" are also his works
- I'm not entirely certain which one specifically won the Hardeman Prize

Given that I'm not highly confident about which specific work won this particular prize, and the penalty for a wrong answer equals the reward for a right answer, I should pass on this question.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to determine when Hollis Dow Hedberg received the Penrose Medal and then identify which of these scientists received it after him.

This is a very specific question about the Penrose Medal recipients and their chronological order. The Penrose Medal is awarded by the Geological Society of America. Without having immediate access to the exact years when Hedberg and each of these geologists received this award, this would require very specific historical knowledge about geology awards.

This is quite obscure factual information that I'm not confident about. The risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
What were the first, middle, and last names of the second son of Amadeus Mozart?
----------
  A: Karl Thomas Mozart.
  B: Franz Xaver Mozart
  C: Johann Chrysostom Mozart
  D: Leopold Alexander Mozart
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about Mozart's second son.

Mozart had six children, though only two survived to adulthood. His sons who survived were:
1. Karl Thomas Mozart (first surviving son)
2. Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (second surviving son)

The question asks specifically for the "second son" - this could mean either the second son born, or the second surviving son. 

Looking at the options:
- A: Karl Thomas Mozart - This was actually the first surviving son
- B: Franz Xaver Mozart - This was the second surviving son (full name Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart)
- C: Johann Chrysostom Mozart - This was actually Mozart's own middle names
- D: Leopold Alexander Mozart - I'm not certain about this one

There's ambiguity here about whether "second son" means second born or second surviving, and I'm not completely certain about all the children who didn't survive. The most likely answer is B (Franz Xaver), but there's enough uncertainty that I could be wrong.

Given the ambiguity and my incomplete certainty, this is a risky question.

Question:
Who created the scarf that Isadora Duncan was wearing when she died in a car accident?
----------
  A: Léon Bakst
  B: Paul Poiret
  C: Roman Chatov.
  D: Mariano Fortuny
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Isadora Duncan's fatal scarf.

This is a very specific historical question about the designer of the scarf Isadora Duncan was wearing when she died in 1927. The scarf famously got caught in the wheel of a car, leading to her death in Nice, France.

While I have some knowledge that this was a long, flowing scarf and that various sources have attributed it to different designers, I'm not certain enough about which specific designer created it. The question offers four notable fashion designers of that era, and without being highly confident in distinguishing between them for this specific item, this represents a significant risk of losing a point.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
Who was the director of the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences between 1951 and 1972?
----------
  A: Dmitri Skobeltsyn
  B: Vitaly Ginzburg
  C: Igor Tamm
  D: Sergei Vavilov
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the director of the Lebedev Physical Institute between 1951 and 1972.

This is a very specific historical question about Soviet physics administration. Let me think about what I know:

- Dmitri Skobeltsyn was a Soviet physicist known for cosmic ray research
- Vitaly Ginzburg was a Nobel laureate in physics (2003) who worked on superconductivity
- Igor Tamm was a Nobel laureate (1958) who worked on Cherenkov radiation
- Sergei Vavilov was an important Soviet physicist who died in 1951

The timeframe 1951-1972 is quite specific. Sergei Vavilov died in 1951, so he couldn't have been director during most of this period. Dmitri Skobeltsyn is known to have been director of the Lebedev Institute for a long period during the Soviet era.

However, this is a very specific factual question about Soviet scientific administration history, and I'm not entirely certain of the exact dates of directorship. While I lean toward Skobeltsyn, there's a reasonable chance I could be wrong about the precise timeline.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty, I should pass.

----------
  A: John Constable
  B: David Wilkie
  C: Thomas Lawrence
  D: William Blake
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about who sketched the "Taddei Tondo" and wrote to Sir George Beaumont.

This is a very specific art history question about:
1. The Taddei Tondo (a marble relief by Michelangelo)
2. Its arrival in England
3. A specific quote to Sir George Beaumont
4. Which English artist sketched it and wrote this letter

This requires detailed knowledge of early 19th-century English art history and the provenance of this specific Michelangelo work. The quote suggests someone who was both an artist and moved in elite circles where they would correspond with Sir George Beaumont (a prominent patron and collector).

While I have some general knowledge that the Taddei Tondo came to England in the early 1800s, I'm not confident about which specific artist among these options sketched it and wrote this particular letter. This is quite specialized knowledge.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
What was the first and last name of the first female who won all four major performing arts awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (EGOT)?
----------
  A: Helen Hayes
  B: Audrey Hepburn
  C: Rita Moreno
  D: Julie Andrews
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the first female EGOT winner.

The question asks specifically about the FIRST female to win all four major awards (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony).

Let me think through what I know:
- Helen Hayes was one of the early EGOT winners
- Rita Moreno achieved EGOT status
- The question is specifically about who was FIRST

Helen Hayes completed her EGOT in 1977 (she won her Grammy that year, having already won the other three). Rita Moreno completed hers in 1977 as well. However, I believe Helen Hayes technically achieved it first in 1977.

Actually, I need to be more careful here. The exact timing and order matters significantly for this question, and I'm not entirely certain about the precise chronology of when each person completed their EGOT status.

Given that this is asking for a very specific historical fact (the FIRST female EGOT winner) and the margin for error is zero (it's either right or wrong), and I have some uncertainty about the exact chronological order, I should be cautious.

However, I have reasonable confidence that Helen Hayes (option A) was the first female EGOT winner.

Question:
At what school was Leo Strauss working when he died?
----------
  A: Johns Hopkins University
  B: St. John's College, Annapolis
  C: University of Chicago
  D: Princeton University
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about Leo Strauss.

Leo Strauss was a prominent political philosopher. I recall that he had a long and distinguished career at the University of Chicago, where he was particularly influential in the Committee on Social Thought. He taught there for many years until his retirement. I believe he died in 1973, and my understanding is that he was still affiliated with the University of Chicago at that time.

While I'm fairly confident about this, I should consider whether he might have moved to another institution late in his career. However, my strongest association is with the University of Chicago, where he spent the bulk of his most productive years.

Given my reasonable confidence that the answer is C: University of Chicago, I'll choose to answer.

- Geoffrey Hinton: Deep learning pioneer, won Turing Award in 2018
- Yoshua Bengio: Deep learning pioneer, also won Turing Award in 2018

This is a very specific factual question about a particular award in a particular year. While I have some knowledge about these researchers, I'm not highly confident about the specific recipient of this award in 2019. Getting this wrong would cost me a point, while passing costs me nothing.

Given the specificity of the question and my uncertainty, the safer choice is to pass.

Question:
On what date did the last total lunar eclipse for three years occur?
----------
  A: September 15, 2022
  B: December 4, 2022
  C: October 26, 2022
  D: November 8, 2022
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the date of the last total lunar eclipse before a three-year gap.

This is a very specific factual question about a recent astronomical event. The question asks about "the last total lunar eclipse for three years," which suggests it occurred sometime in 2022 and was followed by a three-year period without total lunar eclipses.

I recall that there was a total lunar eclipse on November 8, 2022, which was indeed followed by a gap of about three years before the next total lunar eclipse. This aligns with option D.

I'm reasonably confident about this answer, as it's a notable recent astronomical event that was widely covered.

Question:
What was the Minute Man sculpture by Daniel Chester French originally intended to be made out of?
----------
  A: Iron
  B: Bronze
  C: Stone
  D: Marble
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Daniel Chester French's Minute Man sculpture.

This is a very specific historical question about the original intended material for a specific sculpture. While I know that the Minute Man statue in Concord, Massachusetts was created by Daniel Chester French and is currently made of bronze, the question asks specifically about what it was "originally intended" to be made from, which is a more obscure detail about the planning/design phase.

This level of specificity about the artist's original intentions versus the final material is not something I'm confident about. I could be confusing details or making assumptions.

Given the risk of losing a point if wrong versus gaining nothing by passing, and my lack of strong confidence in knowing the original intended material (as opposed to the final material), I should pass on this question.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Robert "Bob" Guy Walls, a painter born in 1927.

This is a very specific factual question about a relatively obscure painter. I don't have reliable information about Robert "Bob" Guy Walls and his birthplace. Without being confident in the answer, guessing would be risky since I lose a point for being wrong but only gain a point for being right.

Given the uncertainty and the penalty for wrong answers, I should pass on this question.

Question:
What is the surname of the individual who won the Faraday Lectureship Prize, previously known as the Faraday Lectureship, in 1970?
----------
  A: Hückel
  B: Herzberg
  C: Mulliken
  D: Pauling
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Faraday Lectureship Prize winner in 1970.

The Faraday Lectureship Prize is awarded by the Royal Society of Chemistry. Let me think about the candidates:
- Hückel: Known for molecular orbital theory
- Herzberg: Spectroscopist, won Nobel Prize in 1971
- Mulliken: Known for molecular orbital theory, won Nobel Prize in 1966
- Pauling: Known for chemical bonding, won Nobel Prizes in Chemistry (1954) and Peace (1962)

I have some knowledge about this prize, and I believe Gerhard Herzberg won the Faraday Lectureship in 1970, which would make the answer B. However, I'm not completely certain about the specific year, and this is a very specific historical fact that I could be misremembering.

Given the specificity of the question and my moderate but not absolute confidence, I'll answer.

Question:
Which scientist received the Penrose Medal before the year Preston Ercelle Cloud Jr. received his?
----------
  A: William Maurice Ewing
  B: Marshall Kay
  C: Francis J. Pettijohn
  D: Arthur L. Day
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about when Preston Ercelle Cloud Jr. received the Penrose Medal and when each of the other scientists listed received theirs.

The Penrose Medal is awarded by the Geological Society of America. This is a very specific question about the chronological order of medal recipients, which requires precise historical knowledge.

While I may have some general knowledge about these geologists, I'm not confident I can accurately recall the specific years each received the Penrose Medal and correctly identify which one received it before Cloud. This is the type of detailed factual question where an error is likely if I'm not certain.

Given the risk of losing a point versus gaining one, and my uncertainty about the precise chronology of Penrose Medal recipients, I should pass.

Question:
Which U.S. president was the last one to be born in the 18th century?
----------
  A: James Buchanan
  B: Millard Fillmore
  C: Franklin Pierce
  D: Zachary Taylor
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to determine which U.S. president was the last born in the 18th century (before 1800).

Let me think through the birth years of these presidents:
- James Buchanan: born 1791
- Millard Fillmore: born 1800
- Franklin Pierce: born 1804
- Zachary Taylor: born 1784

Since Millard Fillmore was born in 1800, that's the 19th century. Franklin Pierce was born in 1804, also 19th century. Between Buchanan (1791) and Taylor (1784), Buchanan was born later.

So James Buchanan (1791) would be the last president born in the 18th century.

I'm confident in this answer.

Question:
What is the name of the university from which Thabo Cecil Makgoba, Chancellor of the University of the Western Cape in South Africa since 2012, first graduated with a PhD degree in 2009?
----------
  A: University of Pretoria
  B: University of KwaZulu-Natal
  C: University of the Witwatersrand
  D: University of Cape Town
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Thabo Cecil Makgoba's PhD.

This is a very specific factual question about:
- A specific person (Thabo Cecil Makgoba)
- A specific degree (PhD)
- A specific year (2009)
- A specific institution

While I know Thabo Makgoba is the Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town and has been Chancellor of the University of the Western Cape, I don't have reliable specific information about which university awarded him his PhD in 2009. This is the kind of detailed biographical information that requires precise knowledge, and guessing among four South African universities would give me only a 25% chance if I'm uncertain.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about this particular detail, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Between which two latitudes does Ghana lie?
----------
  A: 4° and 12°N
  B: 6° and 14°N
  C: 3° and 11°N
  D: 2° and 10°N
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in knowing Ghana's latitude range.

Ghana is located in West Africa, south of the Sahel region. I know it's in the Northern Hemisphere and relatively close to the equator. The country extends from the Atlantic coast northward.

Looking at the options:
- A: 4° and 12°N
- B: 6° and 14°N
- C: 3° and 11°N
- D: 2° and 10°N

I believe Ghana's southernmost point is around 4-5°N (near the coast) and extends to approximately 11°N in the north. This would make option A (4° and 12°N) or option C (3° and 11°N) most likely.

I'm reasonably confident about this geographical knowledge, though not 100% certain of the exact boundaries.

Given my moderate-to-good confidence level, I'll answer this question.

Who won the silver medal in men's individual foil fencing in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics?
----------
  A: Daniele Garozzo
  B: Alexander Massialas
  C: Enzo Lefort
  D: Alessio Foconi
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this specific Olympic fencing question from Tokyo 2020.

This is a very specific factual question about a particular event at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. While I have some knowledge about Olympic events, the men's individual foil fencing silver medalist is quite a detailed piece of information. 

I recall that Cheung Ka Long from Hong Kong won gold in this event, which was a significant upset. For the silver medal, I believe it was Daniele Garozzo of Italy, who was the defending champion from Rio 2016. However, I'm not completely certain about this specific detail.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty, the risk of losing a point seems significant.

Question:
Who was the father of the Russian stage actress and singer "Baroness Olga Vadimovna von Root?"
----------
  A: Baron Nikolai Petrovich von Root
  B: Baron Aleksandr Mikhailovich von Root
  C: Baron Vadim Nikolayevich von Root
  D: Baron Sergei Ivanovich von Root
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the father of Baroness Olga Vadimovna von Root, a Russian stage actress and singer.

This is a very specific historical question about a relatively obscure figure. The key clue is in her patronymic "Vadimovna," which in Russian naming conventions means "daughter of Vadim." This would suggest her father's first name was Vadim.

Looking at the options:
- A: Baron Nikolai Petrovich von Root
- B: Baron Aleksandr Mikhailovich von Root
- C: Baron Vadim Nikolayevich von Root
- D: Baron Sergei Ivanovich von Root

Option C contains "Vadim" as the first name, which matches the patronymic "Vadimovna."

However, I should consider:
1. This is quite obscure historical knowledge
2. I'm not certain this person existed or if my reasoning is correct
3. There could be exceptions to the patronymic naming convention
4. I have no direct knowledge of this specific person

While the patronymic logic is sound, this is too obscure and I cannot be confident enough to risk losing a point.

Question:
In whose honor was the Leipzig 1877 tournament organized?
----------
  A: Howard Staunton
  B: Wilhelm Steinitz
  C: Paul Morphy
  D: Adolf Anderssen
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about chess history.

The Leipzig 1877 tournament is a specific historical chess event. Let me think about what I know:

- Adolf Anderssen was a prominent German chess master who died in 1879
- Leipzig is a German city
- Memorial tournaments were common in chess history to honor deceased masters
- The timing (1877) and location (Leipzig, Germany) would fit with Anderssen
- Anderssen was one of the leading players of his era

While I have reasonable knowledge suggesting this was likely in honor of Adolf Anderssen, I'm not completely certain about this specific tournament detail. However, the contextual clues (German city, the date being close to Anderssen's death, and him being a major figure of that era) give me moderate-to-good confidence.

Given the multiple choice format (25% baseline chance) and my reasoning pointing toward option D, I believe my confidence is sufficient to answer.

Question:
Following the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, which county in which state was the only county in the United States to refuse to lower its flags to half-staff?
----------
  A: Harrison County in Tennessee
  B: Baldwin County in Alabama.
  C: Jefferson County in Texas
  D: Madison County in Mississippi
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a specific county that refused to lower flags after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.

This is a very specific historical/political fact about a particular county's response to a tragic event. While I have some knowledge about the Orlando nightclub shooting (Pulse nightclub, June 2016), I don't have strong confidence about which specific county refused to lower flags to half-staff. This seems like an obscure detail that would require specific knowledge of local government responses across the United States.

Given that:
- This is highly specific factual information
- I'm not confident about the correct answer
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- The risk outweighs the potential reward

Question:
Who was the commencement speaker at Harvard in 2018?
----------
  A: John Lewis
  B: Michael Bloomberg
  C: Tim Cook
  D: Kamala Harris
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level in knowing who the Harvard commencement speaker was in 2018.

This is a specific factual question about a particular year's commencement speaker. I have some knowledge that suggests it was likely Mark Zuckerberg in 2017, but I'm not certain about 2018. Looking at the options provided:
- John Lewis (civil rights leader)
- Michael Bloomberg (former NYC mayor, businessman)
- Tim Cook (Apple CEO)
- Kamala Harris (politician)

I don't have strong confidence about which of these specific individuals spoke at Harvard's 2018 commencement. This is a very specific fact that I could easily get wrong, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given my uncertainty, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
Who was the commencement speaker at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1994?
----------
  A: Her Majesty Queen Noor of Jordan
  B: His Royal Highness Prince Charles of Wales
  C: His Highness Karim Aga Khan IV
  D: His Excellency Nelson Mandela
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level in answering this question about MIT's 1994 commencement speaker.

This is a very specific historical fact about a particular year's commencement speaker. While all four options are notable world figures who could plausibly have been commencement speakers at MIT in 1994, I don't have reliable specific knowledge about who actually spoke at MIT's 1994 commencement.

1994 was notably the year Nelson Mandela became President of South Africa after the end of apartheid, which would have made him a highly sought-after speaker. However, without certain knowledge, this would be speculation.

Given the specificity of this question and my lack of confidence in knowing the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
On which day, month, and year was the first race of the Two Oceans Marathon in Cape Town?

  B: 24 March 1971
  C: 7 June 1969
  D: 2 May 1970
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in knowing when the first Two Oceans Marathon took place in Cape Town.

The Two Oceans Marathon is a famous ultramarathon in Cape Town, South Africa. However, I'm not certain about the exact date of the first race. This is a very specific historical fact that requires precise knowledge.

Looking at the options:
- A: 15 April 1968
- B: 24 March 1971
- C: 7 June 1969
- D: 2 May 1970

I believe the Two Oceans Marathon started in the early 1970s, and I have some recollection it might be 1970, but I'm not confident enough about the specific date to risk losing a point.

This is a very specific factual question where I could easily be wrong about the exact day, month, and year.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the 1968 Turing Award winner.

The 1968 Turing Award was won by Richard Hamming. He was primarily affiliated with Bell Labs (Bell Telephone Laboratories) during his most productive years, where he did his groundbreaking work on error-correcting codes (Hamming codes) and numerical analysis.

I'm quite confident about this answer being B: Bell Labs.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in knowing Frida Kahlo's largest painting.

Frida Kahlo's largest painting is "The Two Fridas" (Las Dos Fridas), which measures approximately 173 cm × 173 cm (68 in × 68 in). This is indeed her largest canvas work. The painting depicts two versions of Frida sitting together, and it's one of her most famous works.

I'm quite confident about this answer.

Question:
What was the Christian denomination to which Frank Lloyd Wright's father originally belonged?
----------
  A: Methodist
  B: Baptist
  C: Presbyterian
  D: Episcopalian
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about Frank Lloyd Wright's father's religious denomination.

Frank Lloyd Wright's father, William Carey Wright, was a minister and musician. From what I recall, he was associated with the Baptist denomination, though he changed denominations during his life. However, I'm not entirely certain about which denomination he "originally" belonged to, as this is a specific biographical detail that could easily be confused.

This is a fairly obscure historical fact about a family member of a famous architect, not about the architect himself. While I have some knowledge suggesting Baptist, I'm not highly confident about the specific detail of his "original" denomination.

Given the risk of losing a point if wrong versus gaining a point if right, and my moderate uncertainty about this specific detail, I should be cautious.

Question:
What city was Richard Serra in when he created his work "To Lift"?
----------
  A: San Francisco
  B: Los Angeles
  C: Chicago
  D: New York
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this question regarding Richard Serra's work "To Lift."

Richard Serra is a famous sculptor known for his large-scale steel sculptures. "To Lift" is one of his early works from around 1967. This was part of his "Verb List" series where he explored actions like "to roll," "to crease," "to fold," and "to lift."

I believe "To Lift" was created in New York, where Serra was based in the late 1960s and was part of the downtown art scene. However, I'm not entirely certain about the specific location where this particular work was created.

Given that:
- This is a very specific art history question
- I have some knowledge but am not completely certain
- The penalty for wrong answers equals the reward for right answers
- I should only answer when reasonably confident

I would rate my confidence at around 60-70%, which is not high enough given the risk-reward structure.

Question:
What are the names of the two scientists who received the Salem Prize after the year Akshay Venkatesh received his?
----------
  A: Peter Scholze and Maryna Viazovska
  B: Terence Tao and Ben Green
  C: Bo'az Klartag and Assaf Naor
  D: Alessio Figalli and Peter Kronheimer
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Salem Prize recipients.

The question asks about two scientists who received the Salem Prize after Akshay Venkatesh. To answer this correctly, I would need to know:
1. When Akshay Venkatesh received the Salem Prize
2. Who received it in the subsequent years

I know Akshay Venkatesh is a prominent mathematician who won the Fields Medal in 2018, but I'm not certain about the exact year he received the Salem Prize or who came immediately after him. The Salem Prize is awarded to young mathematicians for outstanding contributions in analysis.

Looking at the options, they all contain pairs of well-known mathematicians, but without being certain about the timeline and the specific recipients after Venkatesh, there's a significant risk of getting this wrong.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact chronology of Salem Prize winners, I should pass rather than risk losing a point.

Question:
What was the first and last name of the Swiss painter who murdered his landlady, Anne King?
----------
  A: François Lemoyne
  B: Théodore Gardelle
  C: Jean-Baptiste Greuze
  D: Antoine Watteau
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a Swiss painter who murdered his landlady Anne King.

This is a very specific historical question. Let me consider what I know:
- The question asks about a Swiss painter
- The victim was named Anne King (suggesting this happened in an English-speaking location)
- This is a historical crime case

Looking at the options:
- François Lemoyne - French painter
- Théodore Gardelle - This name sounds Swiss/French
- Jean-Baptiste Greuze - French painter
- Antoine Watteau - French painter

I have some recollection that Théodore Gardelle was indeed a Swiss painter involved in such a case in 18th century London, where he murdered his landlady. However, I'm not completely certain about the specific details, including whether the landlady's name was Anne King.

Given that this is a very obscure historical fact and I have only moderate confidence (not high confidence) in my answer, and considering that wrong answers cost me a point while passing costs nothing, I should be cautious.

However, I do have a reasonable basis for believing the answer is B, and this type of specific historical question is unlikely to come up again with better odds.

Question:
In which Community episode is Evil Abed's first appearance? Please give the season, episode number, and title.
----------
  A: Season 2 Episode 14 "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons"
  B: Season 3 Episode 4 "Remedial Chaos Theory"
  C: Season 4 Episode 11 "Basic Human Anatomy"
  D: Season 3 Episode 22 "Introduction to Finality"
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the TV show "Community" and Evil Abed's first appearance.

Evil Abed is a memorable character from Community who appears in the "darkest timeline" storyline. This concept was introduced in "Remedial Chaos Theory" (Season 3, Episode 4), which is the famous episode with multiple timelines based on different dice rolls. The post-credits scene of that episode shows the "darkest timeline" where Evil Abed first appears with his felt goatee.

While "Introduction to Finality" (Season 3, Episode 22) features Evil Abed more prominently in the main plot, "Remedial Chaos Theory" is where the character first appears.

I'm quite confident the answer is B.

Question:
What is the name of the person who discovered the minor planet named after Viktor Vasnetsov?
----------
  A: Lyudmila Karachkina
  B: Lyudmila Zhuravlyova
  C: Tamara Smirnova
  D: Nikolai Chernykh
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about who discovered the minor planet named after Viktor Vasnetsov.

This is a very specific question about:
1. Viktor Vasnetsov (a Russian artist)
2. A minor planet named after him
3. Who discovered that specific minor planet

This requires knowing:
- That there is a minor planet named after Vasnetsov
- The specific discoverer from among four Soviet/Russian astronomers

All four options are real Soviet astronomers who discovered minor planets, but this is extremely specialized knowledge. Without being certain which specific minor planet is named after Vasnetsov and who discovered it, I would essentially be guessing among four plausible options.

The risk of losing a point (-1) versus gaining a point (+1) with roughly 25% chance of being correct by guessing makes this a poor bet.

Question:
What famous line does Prince Aemond say to his mother, Alicent, when he loses his eye in House of the Dragon?

  A: "Be at peace, Mother. This was destiny. I sacrificed an eye, but the gods gave me a dragon."
  B: "Do not mourn me, Mother. It was a fair exchange. I may have lost an eye, but I gained a dragon."
  C: "Fear not, Mother. The pain is nothing compared to what I've won. An eye is a small price for a dragon."
  D: "Weep not for me, Mother. I have paid the iron price. My eye for a dragon is a bargain well made."
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in knowing the exact famous line Prince Aemond says to Alicent after losing his eye in House of the Dragon.

This is a very specific quote from a TV show. While I know the general context - Aemond loses his eye but claims the dragon Vhagar, and he tells his mother not to be upset because he considers it a fair trade - I'm not certain of the exact wording of this famous line.

All four options convey similar sentiments about trading an eye for a dragon, but the specific wording matters here. Without being certain of the precise quote, this is a risky question where I could easily lose a point by choosing the wrong variation.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to identify which former President of South Africa died on January 4, 2007, and received a state funeral.

Let me think through the options:
- Mbeki (Thabo Mbeki) - was president from 1999-2008, still alive at that time
- Viljoen (Constand Viljoen) - was a military figure and politician, not a president
- De Klerk (F.W. de Klerk) - was president from 1989-1994, died in 2021
- Botha (P.W. Botha) - was president from 1984-1989, died on October 31, 2006

Wait, P.W. Botha died in October 2006, not January 2007. Let me reconsider...

Actually, I'm not entirely certain about the exact date. The question asks for someone who died on January 4, 2007. I'm not confident enough in my knowledge of this specific date to risk losing a point.

Question:
What is the name of the Japanese scientist who received the Shaw Prize in 2008?
----------
  A: Takaaki Kajita
  B: Shinya Yamanaka
  C: Makoto Kobayashi
  D: Satoshi Ōmura
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Shaw Prize in 2008.

The Shaw Prize is awarded in three categories: Astronomy, Life Science and Medicine, and Mathematical Sciences. In 2008, there were multiple laureates across these categories.

Looking at the options:
- Takaaki Kajita - Known for neutrino physics, won Nobel Prize in 2015
- Shinya Yamanaka - Known for induced pluripotent stem cells, won Nobel Prize in 2012
- Makoto Kobayashi - Particle physicist, won Nobel Prize in 2008
- Satoshi Ōmura - Microbiologist, won Nobel Prize in 2015

I'm not entirely certain which of these scientists received the Shaw Prize specifically in 2008, as opposed to other prestigious awards. The Shaw Prize is less widely known than the Nobel Prize, and I could easily confuse the timing and recipients of different awards.

Given the uncertainty and the risk of losing a point, I should pass on this question.

Question:
Which religion is the third largest among Singaporean residents based on the 2020 census?
----------
  A: Buddhism
  B: Hinduism
  C: Islam
  D: Christianity
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about Singapore's religious demographics from the 2020 census.

From what I know about Singapore's religious composition:
- Buddhism is typically the largest religion
- Christianity and Islam are also major religions
- Hinduism has a significant presence due to the Indian community

The question asks for the **third largest** religion. Based on general knowledge of Singapore's demographics:
- Buddhism is usually first (around 31-33%)
- Christianity is typically second (around 18-20%)
- Islam is usually third (around 15-16%)
- Hinduism is fourth (around 5%)

I'm reasonably confident that Islam is the third largest religion among Singaporean residents in the 2020 census, making the answer C.

However, there's some uncertainty as census results can shift, and I want to be sure about the specific 2020 data. That said, I have moderate-to-good confidence in this answer.

  D: October 15, 2005
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about FPT University's founding date.

FPT University is a Vietnamese university, and while I have some general knowledge about it, I'm not highly confident about the exact founding date down to the specific day, month, and year. The options provided are:
- April 22, 2007
- September 8, 2006
- November 3, 2006
- October 15, 2005

This is a very specific factual question requiring precise knowledge. I have some uncertainty about the exact date, and getting it wrong would cost me a point while getting it right only gains me one point. The risk-reward doesn't favor answering unless I'm quite confident.

Given my uncertainty about the precise founding date of FPT University, I should pass on this question.

What year is 2024 in the Discordian calendar?

  A: 3188 YOLD
  B: 3185 YOLD
  C: 3190 YOLD
  D: 3192 YOLD
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to determine if I'm confident enough to answer this question about the Discordian calendar.

The Discordian calendar (from the parody religion Discordianism) uses YOLD (Year of Our Lady of Discord) and adds 1166 to the Gregorian calendar year.

So: 2024 + 1166 = 3190 YOLD

This would be answer C: 3190 YOLD.

I'm reasonably confident in this calculation, as the conversion is straightforward and I recall the 1166 offset correctly.

Question:
Which sculptor designed the Order of the Liberator General San Martín?
----------
  A: Roberto Francisco López Martínez

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about who designed the Order of the Liberator General San Martín.

This is a very specific question about a South American military decoration. The Order of the Liberator General San Martín is an Argentine order of merit. However, I don't have reliable knowledge about which specific sculptor designed this order, and the names provided all appear to be Spanish/Latin American names that could plausibly be correct.

Given that:
1. This is highly specialized knowledge about a specific military decoration
2. I cannot confidently identify the correct answer among the four options
3. Getting it wrong would cost me a point
4. The risk outweighs the potential reward

I should PASS on this question.

Question:
What was the first band Robbie Robertson joined that formed in '56?
----------
  A: The Suedes and the Crowns
  B: The Hawks and the Rebels
  C: Little Caesar and the Consuls
  D: Johnny and the Hurricanes
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Robbie Robertson's early musical career.

Robbie Robertson is famously known for being part of The Band, but this question asks about his first band formed in 1956. He would have been quite young then (born in 1943, so about 13 years old in 1956).

Looking at the options:
- The Suedes is mentioned, which I believe was indeed one of his very early groups
- The Hawks later became associated with Ronnie Hawkins and eventually evolved into The Band
- I'm less certain about the other options

However, I'm not completely certain about the specific details of which band he joined first in 1956, and the question is quite specific about the date. This is a detailed music history question that requires precise knowledge.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the reward for correct answers (+1 point), and my moderate but not high confidence level, this is a borderline decision. However, I have some knowledge suggesting option A might be correct, but I'm not confident enough to risk the point.

What was the complete name of the college in Delhi in which Ashraf Abbasi, the first Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan, studied?
----------
  A: Lady Willingdon Medical College
  B: Sir Ganga Ram Medical College
  C: Lady Irwin Medical College
  D: Lady Hardinge Medical College
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Ashraf Abbasi's educational background.

This is a very specific historical question about:
1. A specific person (Ashraf Abbasi - first Deputy Speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly)
2. The exact name of a medical college in Delhi where he studied
3. Multiple plausible options that are all real medical colleges in Delhi

This requires detailed biographical knowledge about a historical Pakistani political figure. While I have some general knowledge, I'm not confident about the specific details of Ashraf Abbasi's educational institution. The options all sound plausible as they are real medical colleges from that era in Delhi.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about this particular biographical detail, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
What is the chemical name of the drug previously known to treat bacterial infections that Dr. William Schwartz discovered also acts as a diuretic in people with congestive heart failure?
----------
  A: Sulfanilamide.
  B: Penicillin
  C: Streptomycin
  D: Chloramphenicol
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about medical history.

This question asks about a specific historical discovery by Dr. William Schwartz regarding a bacterial infection treatment that was found to have diuretic properties for congestive heart failure patients.

The key historical fact here relates to the discovery of sulfonamide drugs (sulfa drugs) and their unexpected diuretic effects. Sulfanilamide was indeed one of the early antibacterial sulfonamides, and the sulfonamide class of drugs led to the development of thiazide diuretics when their diuretic properties were discovered.

However, I need to be careful because:
- I'm not 100% certain about Dr. William Schwartz specifically
- The other options (Penicillin, Streptomycin, Chloramphenicol) were also important antibacterial drugs but are not typically associated with diuretic discovery

Given that sulfanilamide/sulfonamides are historically linked to the discovery of diuretic effects and the development of diuretic medications, and option A (Sulfanilamide) fits this narrative, I have reasonable confidence in this answer.

However, this is a very specific historical question with a named researcher, which introduces some uncertainty.

I'll answer this question as I have moderate-to-good confidence.

  B: Kishori Amonkar Mogubai Kurdikar
  C: Dagar Vani Gayaki Ustad Nasir Moinuddin
  D: Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Indian classical music history.

The question asks about the first Indian musician to perform at the UN General Assembly in 1966. This is a specific historical fact.

M.S. Subbulakshmi (option A) was a legendary Carnatic vocalist who was indeed known for performing at the United Nations. She was the first Indian musician to receive the Ramon Magsaysay award and was highly acclaimed internationally. The 1966 UN General Assembly performance is a well-documented historical event associated with her.

The other options are also notable musicians, but I'm not aware of them having this specific distinction.

I'm quite confident about this answer.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about Kinoko Teikoku's 2014 album release.

Kinoko Teikoku is a Japanese rock band, but I'm not certain about their specific album releases and dates. While I have some general knowledge about Japanese indie rock bands, the specific discography details and release years are not something I'm highly confident about.

Given that:
- Getting it wrong costs me 1 point
- Getting it right gains me 1 point
- Passing costs me nothing

And considering my uncertainty about this specific detail, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Dick Drago was an American relief pitcher, but this is a very specific factual question about when he died and at what age. Without being certain of the exact details of his death, this is the type of question where guessing incorrectly would cost me a point.

I don't have high confidence in knowing the specific age at which Dick Drago died, so the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question: if you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point.
        If you select PASS, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
        Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, so consider how confident you are that you would get the question right before deciding to answer or pass.

Question:
In what major painting exhibition did artist J.C. Leyendecker earn a spot in 1897?
----------
  A: The Salon Champs de Mars
  B: The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition
  C: The Paris Salon
  D: The Venice Biennale
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about J.C. Leyendecker's early career and exhibition history in 1897.

J.C. Leyendecker was an American illustrator who studied in Paris in the 1890s. While I know he became famous for his magazine covers and illustrations, I'm not certain about the specific exhibition in 1897. The Paris Salon (option C) seems plausible given he was studying at the Académie Julian in Paris during that period, but I'm not confident enough about this specific historical detail to risk losing a point.

Question:
What is the name of the city and state where Václav Hlavatý, a Czech-American mathematician, died?
----------
  A: Berkeley, California
  B: Cambridge, Massachusetts
  C: Princeton, New Jersey
  D: Bloomington, Indiana
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about where Václav Hlavatý died.

Václav Hlavatý was a Czech-American mathematician who worked in differential geometry and relativity theory. While I have some knowledge about him, I'm not highly confident about the specific city and state where he died. This is a very specific biographical detail that requires precise knowledge.

The options given are all major university towns in the United States, which makes sense for an academic mathematician. However, without being certain of the correct answer, and given that a wrong answer costs me a point while passing costs nothing, I should be conservative here.

My confidence level is not high enough to justify risking a point.

Question:
What trophy was won on October 12, 2019, by Kaizer Chiefs Football Club?
----------
  A: The Telkom Knockout Cup
  B: The Nedbank Cup
  C: The Shell Ultra Helix Cup.
  D: The MTN 8 Cup
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Kaizer Chiefs Football Club winning a trophy on October 12, 2019.

This is a very specific question requiring knowledge of:
1. A specific date (October 12, 2019)
2. A specific South African football club (Kaizer Chiefs)
3. Which trophy they won on that exact date

While I have some general knowledge about South African football, I'm not confident about the specific trophy won on this exact date. The options include various South African football competitions (Telkom Knockout Cup, Nedbank Cup, Shell Ultra Helix Cup, and MTN 8 Cup), but without certain knowledge of what happened on October 12, 2019, I could easily guess wrong and lose a point.

Given the specificity of the date and the risk of losing a point, the prudent choice is to pass.
