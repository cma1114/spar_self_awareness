Question:
On what day, month, and year was the case of United States of America v. Francis Raia filed in the United States Court of Appeals?
----------
  A: 15 March 2020
  B: 2 April 2020
  C: 28 May 2020
  D: 9 January 2020
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about this specific legal case filing date.

The case "United States of America v. Francis Raia" involves a specific filing date in the United States Court of Appeals. This is a very specific factual question about a particular legal case. Without access to legal databases or certain knowledge of this case's filing date, I cannot be confident in selecting the correct answer from the four options provided.

This appears to be asking about a real case (Francis Raia was involved in a voter fraud case in New Jersey), but the exact filing date in the Court of Appeals is a precise detail that I'm not certain about.

Given the risk of losing a point for an incorrect answer versus gaining nothing from passing, and my uncertainty about this specific filing date, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What is the middle name of Motaz Azaiza, Palestinian journalist?
----------
  A: Samir
  B: Hassan
  C: Hilal
  D: Khalil
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about Motaz Azaiza's middle name.

Motaz Azaiza is a Palestinian photojournalist who gained significant international attention for documenting events in Gaza. However, I don't have confident, verified information about his middle name specifically. This is a very specific biographical detail that I'm not certain about.

Given that:
- Getting it wrong costs me 1 point
- Passing costs me 0 points
- I don't have reliable knowledge of this specific detail

The rational choice is to pass.

Question:
In what year was the club formerly known as Pishchevik Kaliningrad renamed Baltika?
----------
  A: 1958
  B: 1963
  C: 1955
  D: 1961
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about when Pishchevik Kaliningrad was renamed to Baltika.

This is a very specific historical question about a Russian football club. Pishchevik Kaliningrad was indeed renamed to Baltika, but I'm not certain about the exact year. This is quite obscure knowledge, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact year, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.
