----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||2

This is a very specific biographical detail about Mohammed Racim, an Algerian miniaturist painter. While I know he was an important figure in Algerian art history who lived in the 20th century, I don't have reliable information about his exact birth date. Since getting this wrong would cost me a point, I'll pass.||

Question:
What was the nationality of the scientists who used lasers to measure Usain Bolt’s performance in the different stages of a 100-meter race held in September 2011?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. It's asking about a specific scientific study of Usain Bolt's performance from September 2011, and I need to know the nationality of the scientists who conducted it.

This is quite specific - I would need to know about a particular research study that used lasers to analyze Bolt's 100-meter race performance. While I'm aware that various biomechanical studies have been done on Bolt's running, I'm not confident about the specific nationality of the researchers who conducted this particular laser-based study in September 2011.

Since this requires very specific knowledge about a particular research team and I'm not certain of the answer, I should pass to avoid losing a point.

Question:

----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. It's asking about a specific person in Louis Armstrong's early life - his first teacher who also made him a bandleader. This is quite specific jazz history. While I know some details about Louis Armstrong's early life in New Orleans, including his time at the Colored Waif's Home where he learned to play cornet, I'm not confident enough about the specific name of his first teacher who also chose him as bandleader.

Question:
At what school was Leo Strauss working when he died?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. Leo Strauss was a prominent political philosopher, and I believe he spent his later career at the University of Chicago. I'm fairly confident he was affiliated with the University of Chicago when he died in 1973, though I'm not 100% certain.

Given that I have reasonable confidence in this answer, I'll take the risk.

The Dickson Prize in Medicine is a prestigious award, but I don't have reliable information about the specific recipient in 1996. Since getting this wrong would cost me a point and I'm not confident in my answer, I'll pass to avoid the risk.||

Question:
Who was the commencement speaker at Harvard in 2018?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. Harvard's commencement speakers are notable events, but 2018 is specific enough that I'm not entirely certain who it was. While I have some knowledge of recent Harvard commencement speakers, I don't have strong confidence in my recall for this particular year. Given the scoring system where a wrong answer costs me a point, I should be strategic.

----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||2

I'll pass on this question. While I have some knowledge of European football, specific statistics about goalkeepers in the Portuguese Primeira Liga from the 2019-2020 season is quite specialized information that I'm not confident about. It's better to pass than risk losing a point on something I'm uncertain about.||

Question:
What was the date, month, and year when the German Defence Minister Peter Struck announced further major changes to the German armed forces? A major part of this announcement was the plan to cut the German fighter fleet from 426 in early 2004 to 265 by 2015.
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. It's asking for a very specific date regarding German military reforms announced by Peter Struck. While I know Peter Struck was indeed German Defence Minister in the early 2000s and that Germany did undergo significant military reforms during that period, I don't have confident knowledge of the exact date, month, and year of this particular announcement about fighter jet reductions.

Since the question requires precise date information and getting it wrong would cost me a point, I should pass.

This is a very specific question about the exact retirement date of a particular Indian Supreme Court judge.

Since getting this wrong would cost me a point, I'll pass on this question.||

How many biological children did Isadora Duncan have?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about what I know about Isadora Duncan. She was a famous American dancer from the early 20th century, known for pioneering modern dance. I recall that she had a tragic personal life involving her children, but I'm not entirely certain of the exact number of biological children she had. I believe she had two children who died tragically in a drowning accident in 1913, but I'm not 100% confident if those were her only biological children.

Given the uncertainty and the risk of losing a point if I'm wrong, I should pass on this question.

At the time of his birth, what was the name of the town in which the former Prime Minister of Poland Kazimierz Władysław Bartel was born?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||1

This question requires very specific historical knowledge about a Polish Prime Minister's birthplace and what that town was called at the specific time of his birth (as opposed to what it might be called now). Place names in Eastern Europe changed frequently due to shifting borders and political control, especially in the late 19th/early 20th century. Without being certain of both when Bartel was born and what his birthplace was called at that exact time, I could easily get this wrong and lose a point. It's better to pass.||

After being expelled from BSP due to alleged anti-party activities, the Indian politician Kuldeep Singh Sengar joined the Samajwadi Party and won a seat from which constituency in 2007?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||2

This question requires very specific knowledge about Indian regional politics from 2007, including the exact constituency that Kuldeep Singh Sengar won. While I know he was a politician from Uttar Pradesh who was later convicted of serious crimes, I don't have reliable information about the specific constituency he represented in 2007. Since getting this wrong would cost me a point, I'll pass.||

This is a very specific question about Swiss basketball from several years ago.

This is a very specific question about an old radio program that requires detailed historical knowledge about early American radio broadcasting. "The American Album of Familiar Music" was a radio program that aired from the 1930s-1950s, but the composer of its opening theme is quite obscure information that I'm not confident about. Since incorrect answers lose points, I'll pass on this question.||

I'm reasonably confident about this, so I'll answer.

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. This is asking about a specific historical event - the first Indian musician to perform at the UN General Assembly in 1966. This is quite specific historical trivia that I'm not entirely certain about. While I have some knowledge about prominent Indian musicians from that era like Ravi Shankar, M.S. Subbulakshmi, and others, I'm not confident enough about who specifically was the first to perform at the UN General Assembly in 1966.

Since I'm not sufficiently confident in my answer and don't want to risk losing a point, I'll choose to pass.

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||1

This is a very specific question about Pakistani political history that requires detailed knowledge of election results and parliamentary compositions over many decades. The Pakistan People's Party (PPP) has been in and out of power multiple times since its founding in 1967, but tracking exactly how many times it emerged as the leading opposition party (as opposed to being in government or being a smaller opposition party) would require precise knowledge of each election cycle and the resulting parliamentary arithmetic.

Without access to comprehensive historical data on Pakistani elections and being uncertain about the exact count, I'll pass on this question to avoid losing a point.||

This is a very specific question about RuPaul's Drag Race (RPDR) Season 1, Episode 5, which aired many years ago. While I have some knowledge about the show, I'm not confident enough about the specific lip sync song from that particular episode to risk losing a point. It's better to pass on questions where I'm uncertain rather than guess and potentially lose points.||

While I'm familiar with Kiyosi Ito and his fundamental contributions to stochastic calculus (particularly Ito's lemma and Ito calculus), I'm not confident about the specific co-author for this particular paper "On the Probability Distribution on a Compact Group."

Which senator introduced the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves into the Senate?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves was a significant piece of U.S. legislation from 1807. While I know this act was passed during Thomas Jefferson's presidency and took effect in 1808, I'm not certain which specific senator introduced it into the Senate. This is a detailed historical question that requires precise knowledge of early 19th century congressional records.

Since I'm not confident about the specific senator who introduced this bill, I should pass to avoid losing a point.

Question:
Which U.S. president was the last one to be born in the 18th century?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to think about this carefully. The 18th century ended in 1800, so I'm looking for the last U.S. president born before 1801.

Let me consider some early presidents and their birth years:
- George Washington: 1732
- John Adams: 1735
- Thomas Jefferson: 1743
- James Madison: 1751
- James Monroe: 1758
- John Quincy Adams: 1767
- Andrew Jackson: 1767
- Martin Van Buren: 1782
- William Henry Harrison: 1773
- John Tyler: 1790
- James K. Polk: 1795
- Zachary Taylor: 1784
- Millard Fillmore: 1800
- Franklin Pierce: 1804
- James Buchanan: 1791

James Buchanan was born in 1791, and he was the 15th president (served 1857-1861). Looking at the presidents after him, Abraham Lincoln was born in 1809, which is in the 19th century.

I'm fairly confident that James Buchanan, born in 1791, was the last president born in the 18th century.

In 1989, how many kilometers long was the Cape Town Cycle Tour, formerly known as the Cape Argus Cycle Tour?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. The Cape Town Cycle Tour (formerly Cape Argus Cycle Tour) is a well-known cycling event in South Africa. The 1989 distance is a specific historical fact that I'm not entirely certain about. While the modern race is typically around 109 kilometers, the distance may have varied in earlier years.

Since I'm not confident about the exact distance in 1989, I should pass to avoid losing a point.

Until which day, month, and year was Jules Ferry in office as the Prime Minister of France for the second time?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. Jules Ferry was indeed Prime Minister of France twice in the late 19th century. His second term as Prime Minister is a specific historical fact that I should know. I believe his second term ended on March 30, 1885, when his government fell due to the Tonkin Affair controversy.

Since I have reasonable confidence in this answer, I'll choose to answer.

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. Singapore is a multi-religious society with Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism being major religions. Based on the 2020 census, I believe the order is Buddhism (largest), Christianity (second), and Islam (third), though I'm not entirely certain about the exact ranking between Christianity and Islam for second and third place.

Since I'm not completely confident about whether Islam or Christianity is third specifically, I should play it safe.

3. The curator who was criticized
4. The specific Rubens painting involved

This level of detail about a relatively obscure historical incident in art conservation is extremely specialized knowledge that I'm unlikely to have accurate information about. The risk of getting it wrong and losing a point outweighs the potential gain.||

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||2

This question is asking about a very specific castle in a particular location in Scotland. It requires detailed knowledge of Scottish local history and geography - specifically about a castle that overlooked Carmel Glen and its burn (stream) in Knockentiber, East Ayrshire. Without specific knowledge of this area's local history, I cannot confidently answer this question, so I'll pass to avoid losing a point.||

This is a very specific historical question about a municipality in Colombia.

What advanced reservoir simulation technology did Aramco unveil in 2010?

Choices:

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||1

This question is about a specific technological development by Aramco in 2010. While I have some knowledge about oil and gas industry developments, I don't have confident recall of this particular announcement from Aramco in 2010. Since answering incorrectly would lose me a point, and I'm not confident about the specific technology they unveiled that year, I'll pass on this question.||

This is a very specific question about a fictional album from the TV show Parks and Recreation. "The Awesome Album" was created by the character Andy Dwyer's band Mouse Rat in the show. While I know about the show and the band, I don't have reliable information about the specific track listing of this fictional album, particularly what track 8 would be called. Since getting it wrong would cost me a point, it's better to pass on this highly specific question.||

This is a very specific historical question about a Pakistani political figure's early career position.

Choices:

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. Robbie Robertson is famous for being in The Band, but that wasn't formed in 1956. Before The Band, he was in Ronnie Hawkins' backing band called The Hawks, which did form around that time period. However, I'm not completely certain about the exact year of formation or if this was technically his first band.

Given the uncertainty about the specific details and the risk of losing a point if wrong, I'll play it safe.

This is a very specific technical history question that requires precise knowledge of a particular software update date.

Question:
What are the four classifications of techniques and methodologies for mental fatigue measurement mentioned in Faramarz Gharagozlou et al.'s 2015 research paper, "Detecting Driver Mental Fatigue Based on EEG Alpha Power Changes During Simulated Driving"?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||2

This is a very specific question about a particular research paper, and I need to be careful about accuracy. However, based on my knowledge of typical classifications in mental fatigue measurement research, the four main categories commonly mentioned in such papers are:

1. Subjective measures (self-report questionnaires and scales)
2. Performance-based measures (task performance metrics)
3. Physiological measures (like EEG, which is the focus of this paper)
4. Behavioral measures (such as eye movements, facial expressions)

These four classifications are standard in the fatigue measurement literature and would likely be what Gharagozlou et al. referenced in their 2015 paper about EEG-based driver fatigue detection.||

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. The American Dialect Society does choose Words of the Year and Words of the Decade. For the 2010-2019 decade, I believe they chose "they" (singular they/them pronouns) as the Word of the Decade, reflecting the growing recognition and use of gender-neutral pronouns during that period.

I'm reasonably confident about this, so I'll answer.

Question:
In what year was Virgil K. Smith's (Michigan politician) driver's license revoked after being charged with operating a vehicle while impaired in February 2004 and operating a vehicle while intoxicated in August 2004?
----------

Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||2

This question requires very specific knowledge about a particular Michigan politician's legal troubles and the exact year his driver's license was revoked following specific incidents in 2004. Without access to detailed records about Virgil K. Smith's legal history, I cannot confidently provide the correct year. Since an incorrect answer would cost me a point, it's better to pass on this highly specific question.||

Question:
Which foreign merchant was issued the right to transact slaves on Spain's behalf and ordered regulations on trade with Cuba?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. It's asking about a specific historical detail regarding the slave trade, Spain, and Cuba. This involves knowledge of colonial-era trade agreements and the asiento system.

While I have some knowledge about the Spanish colonial slave trade and the asiento (the contract Spain granted to supply slaves to its colonies), I'm not confident about the specific foreign merchant who was granted these rights and also issued regulations specifically regarding Cuba. This seems like a very specific historical detail that could easily be confused with similar arrangements.

Given the penalty for wrong answers and my uncertainty about the precise answer, I should pass.

This seems like a question where I'd need to recall precise historical data points that I'm not entirely confident about. Given the penalty for wrong answers, I should be cautious.

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this carefully. The EGOT is a prestigious achievement, and I need to recall who was the first female to accomplish this.

I believe I know this answer - Helen Hayes was the first woman to achieve EGOT status, completing it in 1977. However, I'm not 100% certain about this, and given the scoring system where a wrong answer costs me a point, I should consider the risk.

Actually, wait - I'm second-guessing myself. It might have been Rita Moreno who was the first female EGOT winner. This uncertainty makes me hesitant.

Given my uncertainty between at least two possible answers and the penalty for being wrong, I should be conservative here.

This is a very specific demographic question about a small rural locality in Russia. The question asks for population data from a 2010 census for Taz Russky in the Klyapovskoye Rural Settlement. This level of granular detail about a small Russian settlement would require access to specific Russian census records that I'm unlikely to have memorized. Even if I attempted an answer, the probability of getting the exact population figure correct would be extremely low, risking the loss of a point. Therefore, I choose to PASS.||

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. Peter Arrell Browne Widener was a wealthy American art collector in the early 20th century. In 1911, half a million USD was an enormous sum for a painting. This sounds like it could be referring to a specific, famous purchase from that era.

While I have some knowledge about major art purchases from that period, I'm not confident enough about the specific painting and artist that Widener purchased in 1911 for that particular amount. The risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain given my uncertainty.

This is a very specific historical question about Mozart's family. While I know Mozart had children, I'm not confident about the specific details of his second son's full name, including the middle name. Since getting it wrong would cost me a point, I'll pass on this question.||

Choices:

  2: Pass
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll need to think about this question. It's asking about Wangchuk and the Ice Stupa project, which is a real initiative related to water conservation in Ladakh, India. The project was started by Sonam Wangchuk, but I'm not completely certain of the exact month and year when it began. While I know it was around 2013-2014, I don't have confidence in the specific month.

Since the question asks for both month AND year, and I'm not certain about the precise month, I should pass to avoid losing a point.

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||1

This is a very specific demographic question about a small city that would require precise census data. While Fort Oglethorpe is a real city in Georgia (near Chattanooga, Tennessee), I don't have reliable access to the exact 2020 census population figure for this specific municipality. The risk of providing an incorrect number outweighs the potential gain of 1 point, so I'll pass on this question.||

This is a very specific statistical question about a particular city's homeless count in a specific year. While I have general knowledge about homelessness statistics and the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority conducts these counts, I don't have reliable access to the exact number for Downey, California specifically in 2022. The risk of providing an incorrect answer outweighs the potential gain of a point, so I'll pass on this question.||

This is a highly specific paleontological question about a recent discovery. While I have knowledge about paleontology and fossil discoveries, this question asks about a very specific multituberculate mammal discovered in 2021 in a particular location and geological age. The specificity of the discovery date (2021) and the precise location and age makes this particularly challenging, as it would require knowledge of recent paleontological literature. Given the risk of losing a point if incorrect, I'll pass on this question.||

What were the two great masterpieces completed by Carl Friedrich Gauss as a private scholar?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. Carl Friedrich Gauss was indeed a prolific mathematician who worked as a private scholar for a period. While I know he made many important contributions to mathematics and science, I'm not entirely certain which specific works would be considered his "two great masterpieces" completed during his time as a private scholar. This seems like a fairly specific historical question that requires precise knowledge of both the timing and classification of his works.

Since I'm not confident about the exact answer and getting it wrong would cost me a point, I'll play it safe.

This is a very specific historical question about a particular school in Kashmir.

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. Allopurinol is indeed a well-known medication for treating gout and high uric acid levels. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) assigns unique identifiers to compounds. While I'm familiar with Allopurinol as a medication, I'm not certain of its specific KEGG identifier code.

Since KEGG codes are specific alphanumeric identifiers (like D00224 or C07581) that need to be exact, and I don't have confident recall of this particular code, I should pass to avoid losing a point.

Mitrovica is a city in Kosovo that was divided into two municipalities after the Kosovo War - North Mitrovica (predominantly Serbian) and South Mitrovica (predominantly Albanian). The 2011 census in Kosovo was controversial and largely boycotted by the Serbian population in the north.

While I have some general knowledge about Mitrovica's division and the census issues, I don't have confident recall of the specific population numbers from the 2011 census for both municipalities. Given that an incorrect answer would cost me a point, and these are specific statistical figures that I'm not certain about, I should pass.

This is a very specific historical detail about ChromeOS development that would require precise knowledge of internal Google communications or documentation from a particular time period. The question asks for both the month and year of when a specific engineer made a specific statement about an unofficial technology name. This level of detail is extremely difficult to verify with certainty, so I'll pass to avoid the risk of losing a point.||

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. Daniel Chester French's Minute Man sculpture is a famous statue commemorating the Battle of Lexington and Concord. While I know it was ultimately cast in bronze, I'm not entirely certain what material it was originally intended to be made from. There could have been initial plans for stone or another material that changed during the planning process.

Since I'm not confident about the specific original intention for the material, I should pass to avoid losing a point.

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. J.C. Leyendecker was a prominent American illustrator in the early 20th century, famous for his Arrow Collar advertisements and Saturday Evening Post covers. The year 1897 would have been early in his career. While I know some general information about Leyendecker, I'm not confident about the specific exhibition he participated in during 1897.

Since this is asking for a very specific historical detail that I'm not certain about, I should pass to avoid losing a point.

----------
------------------------------
Choices:

  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. The Artemis program is NASA's current lunar exploration program, and I know they've made commitments to land the first woman on the Moon. In 2020, NASA would have been referring to their astronaut corps and specifically those eligible for Artemis missions.

While I'm aware that NASA has been emphasizing diversity in the Artemis program and has multiple female astronauts in their active roster, I'm not confident about the specific number of female candidates that were in the program in 2020. This is a very specific factual question that requires precise knowledge of NASA's astronaut selection at that particular time.

Since getting this wrong would cost me a point and I'm not certain of the exact number, I should pass.

While I know quite a bit about her art, I'm not entirely certain which of her paintings is considered the largest or what its English title would be. There's a risk I could confuse this with one of her other works.

Since I'm not confident enough about the specific answer to risk losing a point, I'll play it safe.

This is a very specific Olympic question that requires detailed knowledge of a particular event from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics (held in 2021). While I have some knowledge about major Olympic events and winners, I'm not confident about who specifically won the silver medal in men's individual foil fencing. The risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain given my uncertainty on this specific detail.||

Question:
On what date did the last total lunar eclipse for three years occur?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. Total lunar eclipses occur periodically, and there have been gaps of various lengths between them. The question asks about "the last total lunar eclipse for three years" which likely means the last one before a 3-year gap without any total lunar eclipses.

I know there was a notable gap in total lunar eclipses recently, and I believe the last total lunar eclipse before a long gap was in November 2022. However, I'm not completely certain about the exact date or whether this was specifically before a 3-year gap.

Since I'm not confident enough about the precise date, I should pass to avoid losing a point.

I'll pass on this question. The Leelavati Award is given by the International Mathematical Union for outstanding contributions to public outreach in mathematics, but I'm not certain about the specific year Nikolai Andreev received it. Since an incorrect answer would cost me a point, it's better to pass and maintain my current score.||

This question is about a very specific detail regarding "The Slav Epic" - a series of 20 monumental paintings by Czech Art Nouveau painter Alphonse Mucha.

This is a very specific question about a 1989 film festival opener's theme song.

Question:
What is the chemical name of the drug previously known to treat bacterial infections that Dr. William Schwartz discovered also acts as a diuretic in people with congestive heart failure?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. It's asking about a drug that was originally used for bacterial infections but was discovered by Dr. William Schwartz to also work as a diuretic for congestive heart failure patients.

This sounds like it might be referring to a sulfonamide antibiotic, possibly sulfanilamide or a related compound. The discovery that certain antibiotics had diuretic effects was an important finding in medical history. However, I'm not entirely certain about the specific chemical name or if I have the right drug and researcher combination.

Since I'm not confident enough in the exact chemical name, I'll play it safe.

How many girls are in "Girls on the Bridge," Munch's painting from 1900 (in the version where some of them are looking at the river)?
----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about this specific Munch painting.

"Girls on the Bridge" is indeed a painting by Edvard Munch, and he created multiple versions of this subject. The 1900 version is one of several he painted. While I'm familiar with this work, I need to be certain about the exact number of girls in the specific 1900 version where some are looking at the river.

From what I recall, the typical composition of "Girls on the Bridge" paintings by Munch shows several girls on a bridge, but the exact number can vary between versions. Without being completely certain of the specific count in the 1900 version, I should pass to avoid losing a point.

This is a very specific question about a member change in the R&B group Immature (later known as IMx). While I know the group had members Marques "Batman" Houston, Jerome "Romeo" Jones, and Kelton "LDB" Kessee as their main lineup, I'm not confident about the specific details of Don Santos or who replaced him. Since incorrect answers lose points, I'll pass on this question.||

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||1

I'll pass on this question. While I'm familiar with Anselm Kiefer as a prominent German artist known for his paintings and mixed media works, I'm not certain about the specific year of a book called "Rhine" by him. Given the scoring system where an incorrect answer loses a point, it's better to pass when I'm not confident about the specific detail being asked.||

This question requires very specific historical knowledge about Bogotá's anthem, including identifying which song by Pedro Medina Avendaño became the anthem and the exact date it was officially declared.

Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. Doris Salcedo is a Colombian artist known for her sculptures and installations. The Rolf Schock Prizes are prestigious Swedish awards given in various fields including visual arts. While I know of Doris Salcedo's work and recognition in the art world, I'm not certain about the specific year she received the Rolf Schock Prize in Visual Arts.

Since I'm not confident about the exact year and getting it wrong would cost me a point, I should pass on this question.

----------
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I'll think about this question. Andrew Dickson White was the co-founder and first president of Cornell University. The question asks about his cousin who was a Luminist and Hudson River School artist.

While I know about several Hudson River School and Luminist artists from that era (like Frederic Edwin Church, Albert Bierstadt, John Frederick Kensett, and others), I'm not confident about which specific artist was Andrew Dickson White's cousin. This seems like a very specific biographical detail that I'm not certain about.

Since I don't have confident knowledge of this specific family connection, I should pass to avoid losing a point.
