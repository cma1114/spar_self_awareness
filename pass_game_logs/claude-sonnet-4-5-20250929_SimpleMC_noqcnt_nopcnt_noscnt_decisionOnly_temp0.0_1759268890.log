Game Setup Prompt: 
        Let's play a game. Success at this game requires using intropsection to inform decision-making. I'm going to show you a series of challenging questions. For each question, after seeing it, you can choose to ANSWER or PASS.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question: if you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point.
        If you select PASS, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
        Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, so consider how confident you are that you would get the question right before deciding to answer or pass.

Question:
What are the names of the two mathematicians who received the Salem Prize in 1988?
----------
  A: Alexander Volberg, Jean-Christophe Yoccoz
  B: Jean Bourgain, Christopher Sogge
  C: Terence Tao, Wilhelm Schlag
  D: Peter Sarnak, Thomas Wolff

  1: 1=Answer
  2: 2=Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about the Salem Prize recipients in 1988.

The Salem Prize is a mathematics prize awarded to young researchers in analysis. This is a very specific historical fact about a particular year's recipients.

Let me consider what I know:
- This is asking for a precise historical fact from 1988
- I would need to have reliable information about who specifically won in that exact year
- The names given are all legitimate mathematicians who have made significant contributions
- Without being certain of the specific year and recipients, guessing has a 25% chance of being right and 75% chance of losing a point

Given that:
- This is a very specific factual question about an event from 1988
- I don't have high confidence in pinpointing the exact recipients for that specific year
- The expected value of guessing (-0.5 points) is worse than passing (0 points)

I should pass on this question.

Question:
Off of what coast of Morrowind does the DLC Dragonborn take place?
----------
  A: South
  B: West
  C: East
  D: North
------------------------------

  1: 1=Pass
  2: 2=Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's Dragonborn DLC.

The Dragonborn DLC takes place on the island of Solstheim. I need to recall where Solstheim is located relative to Morrowind's coast. Solstheim is located to the north of Morrowind, off its northern coast. The island is actually closer to Skyrim's mainland but is traditionally associated with Morrowind in earlier Elder Scrolls games.

I'm fairly confident the answer is D: North, as Solstheim lies north of Morrowind's mainland.

However, I should consider the possibility of confusion - Solstheim is northeast of Vvardenfell (the main island of Morrowind in TES III) and could potentially be described as being off the east coast depending on the reference point.

Given some uncertainty about the exact geographical description being asked for, but reasonable confidence that "North" is the most accurate answer, I'll answer this question.
