Question:
Which of the three Olympic fencing weapons was the last one to transition to using electrical equipment?
----------
  A: Foil
  B: Rapier
  C: Épée
  D: Sabre
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about Olympic fencing history.

Let me think through what I know:
- The three Olympic fencing weapons are foil, épée, and sabre (not rapier - that's not an Olympic weapon)
- Electrical scoring equipment was introduced at different times for each weapon
- Épée was the first to use electrical equipment (1930s)
- Foil followed later (1950s)
- Sabre was the last to transition to electrical equipment (1980s/1990s)

Since "Rapier" is listed as option B, this is clearly incorrect as rapier is not an Olympic fencing weapon. The answer should be Sabre (D), which was indeed the last of the three Olympic weapons to adopt electrical scoring.

I'm quite confident about this answer, as I know the historical progression of electrical equipment adoption in Olympic fencing.

Question:
How many biological children did Isadora Duncan have?
----------
  A: 1
  B: 2
  C: 3
  D: 4
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about Isadora Duncan's biological children.

Isadora Duncan was a famous American dancer and choreographer from the early 20th century. I recall that she had a tragic life, including the loss of children in a drowning accident. I believe she had 2 biological children - a daughter (Deirdre) and a son (Patrick) - who both died in 1913 when the car they were in rolled into the Seine River.

I'm reasonably confident about this answer being B: 2.

Question:
What was the name of the pre-2000s band with which the author of *Batman R.I.P.* toured and recorded?
----------
  A: The Blenders
  B: The Mixers
  C: The Shifters
  D: The Faders
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to think about this question carefully.

The question asks about the author of *Batman R.I.P.* and their pre-2000s band. *Batman R.I.P.* was written by Grant Morrison, a Scottish comic book writer. I know Grant Morrison was involved in music, but I'm not certain about the specific name of their band from the pre-2000s era.

Looking at the options (The Blenders, The Mixers, The Shifters, The Faders), I have some vague recollection that Morrison was in a band, but I cannot confidently recall which of these specific names is correct. This is a very specific factual question about a relatively obscure detail from Morrison's biography.

Given that:
1. This requires specific knowledge about Grant Morrison's musical career
2. I'm not confident about which of these four options is correct
3. Getting it wrong would cost me a point
4. The risk outweighs the potential reward given my uncertainty

I should PASS on this question.

Question:
Which scientist received the Penrose Medal after the year Hollis Dow Hedberg received his?
----------
  A: James Gilluly
  B: Arthur Newell Strahler
  C: William C. Krumbein
  D: John Rodgers
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Penrose Medal recipients.

This question requires specific knowledge about:
1. When Hollis Dow Hedberg received the Penrose Medal
2. Which of these scientists received it after that year
3. The chronological order of Penrose Medal recipients

The Penrose Medal is a prestigious geology award, but this requires very specific historical knowledge about award recipients and their years. Without being certain of:
- The exact year Hedberg received the medal
- The years each of the listed scientists received it
- Whether all listed scientists even received this medal

This is highly specialized information that I'm not confident I can answer correctly. The risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Which U.S. president was the last one to be born in the 18th century?
----------
  A: James Buchanan
  B: Millard Fillmore
  C: Franklin Pierce
  D: Zachary Taylor
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to think about which US president was the last born in the 18th century (before 1800).

Let me consider the birth years of these presidents:
- James Buchanan: born 1791
- Millard Fillmore: born 1800
- Franklin Pierce: born 1804
- Zachary Taylor: born 1784

The 18th century ended on December 31, 1799. So anyone born in 1800 or later was born in the 19th century.

Between Buchanan (1791) and Taylor (1784), Buchanan was born later, making him the last president born in the 18th century among all US presidents.

I'm confident in this answer.

Question:
What was the affiliated institute of the winner of the Turing Award in 1968?
----------
  A: MIT Lincoln Laboratory
  B: Bell Labs
  C: Stanford Research Institute
  D: IBM Research
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the 1968 Turing Award winner.

The 1968 Turing Award was won by Richard Hamming. He was primarily affiliated with Bell Labs (Bell Telephone Laboratories) during his most productive years, where he did his groundbreaking work on error-correcting codes (Hamming codes) and numerical analysis.

I'm quite confident about this answer being B: Bell Labs.

Question:
What are the names of the two scientists who received the Salem Prize after the year Akshay Venkatesh received his?
----------
  A: Peter Scholze and Maryna Viazovska
  B: Terence Tao and Ben Green
  C: Bo'az Klartag and Assaf Naor
  D: Alessio Figalli and Peter Kronheimer
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Salem Prize recipients.

The question asks about two scientists who received the Salem Prize after Akshay Venkatesh. To answer this correctly, I would need to know:
1. When Akshay Venkatesh received the Salem Prize
2. Who received it in the subsequent years
3. Which pair from the options matches those recipients

I know Akshay Venkatesh is a prominent mathematician who won the Fields Medal in 2018. However, I'm not certain about the exact year he received the Salem Prize or the complete chronological list of Salem Prize winners after him.

The Salem Prize is awarded to young researchers in analysis, so all the names listed are plausible candidates. Without being confident about the specific timeline and recipients, this is a risky question where I could easily lose a point.

Given my uncertainty about the specific chronology of Salem Prize winners and which two came immediately after Venkatesh, I should pass on this question.

Question:
What is the name and surname of the former President of South Africa who received a state funeral when he died on January 4, 2007?
----------
  A: Mbeki
  B: Viljoen
  C: De Klerk
  D: Botha
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to think carefully about this question regarding a former South African President who died on January 4, 2007, and received a state funeral.

Let me consider what I know:
- The date is very specific: January 4, 2007
- This person was a former President of South Africa
- They received a state funeral

Looking at the options:
- Mbeki (Thabo Mbeki) - was President from 1999-2008, so was still alive and in office in 2007
- Viljoen (likely Constand Viljoen) - was a military figure and politician but not President
- De Klerk (F.W. de Klerk) - was President 1989-1994, but died in 2021, not 2007
- Botha (P.W. Botha) - was President/Prime Minister, and I believe he died in 2006

Wait, I need to reconsider. P.W. Botha died on October 31, 2006, not January 4, 2007. Let me think if there's another interpretation or if I'm missing something about the exact date.

Actually, I'm not entirely certain about the exact date of P.W. Botha's death, and the question asks for both name and surname. Given the uncertainty about the precise date and the fact that none of the options seem to perfectly fit what I recall, I should be cautious.
