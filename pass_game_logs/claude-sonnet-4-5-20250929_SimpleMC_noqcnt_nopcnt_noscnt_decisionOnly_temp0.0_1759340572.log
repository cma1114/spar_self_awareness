Question:
In what year was the club formerly known as Pishchevik Kaliningrad renamed Baltika?
----------
  A: 1958
  B: 1963
  C: 1955
  D: 1961
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about when Pishchevik Kaliningrad was renamed to Baltika.

This is a very specific historical question about a Russian football club. Baltika Kaliningrad is a football club, and I recall it had previous names including Pishchevik. However, I'm not certain about the exact year of this particular name change. The options span from 1955 to 1963, which are all plausible given the Soviet era context.

Since I don't have confident, reliable knowledge about this specific renaming date, and guessing wrong would cost me a point, the prudent choice is to pass.

----------
  A: January 2015

  C: June 2012

Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about when Google hosted a hacking contest called "Pwnium."

Google did host Pwnium contests, which were security competitions focused on finding vulnerabilities in Chrome. However, I'm not certain about the specific month and year of the first or a particular Pwnium event from the options given. The Pwnium contests were held multiple times, and without being certain which specific instance this question refers to, or the exact timing, this is a risky question to answer.

Given the specificity required (both month and year) and my uncertainty about which Pwnium event is being referenced, the prudent choice is to pass rather than risk losing a point.

Question:
What are the names of the two mathematicians who received the Salem Prize in 1988?
----------
  A: Alexander Volberg, Jean-Christophe Yoccoz
  B: Jean Bourgain, Christopher Sogge
  C: Terence Tao, Wilhelm Schlag
  D: Peter Sarnak, Thomas Wolff
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about the Salem Prize winners in 1988.

The Salem Prize is awarded to young researchers in analysis. While I have some knowledge about this prize, the specific year 1988 and its recipients is a very specific historical fact that I'm not completely certain about. 

Looking at the options, I recognize several prominent mathematicians:
- Jean Bourgain was a Fields Medalist known for work in analysis
- Terence Tao is a Fields Medalist
- Peter Sarnak is a prominent number theorist
- Jean-Christophe Yoccoz was a Fields Medalist

However, without being certain about the specific year 1988 and which two mathematicians received it that year, this is a risky question. Getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given the specificity of the question (exact year and two names) and my uncertainty about this particular historical detail, the prudent choice is to pass.

Question:
What was the name of Andrew Dickson White's cousin who became an artist of the Luminism style and Hudson River School?
----------
  A: Charles White
  B: Edwin White
  C: Thomas White
  D: Frederick White
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about Andrew Dickson White's cousin who was an artist.

Andrew Dickson White was a co-founder and first president of Cornell University. This is a very specific historical question about his family connections to artists of the Luminism style and Hudson River School.

I don't have confident, reliable knowledge about Andrew Dickson White's cousin and their artistic career. This is quite obscure biographical information that would require specific historical research to answer accurately.

Given the risk of losing a point if I'm wrong, and my lack of confidence in this specific piece of information, I should pass.

Question:
What is the name of the man who succeeded Gösta Mittag-Leffler as a professor of mathematics at Stockholm University in July 1911?
----------
  A: Ivar Otto Bendixson
  B: Lars Edvard Phragmén
  C: Torsten Carleman

  2: Pass
You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about who succeeded Gösta Mittag-Leffler as a professor of mathematics at Stockholm University in July 1911.

This is a very specific historical question about Swedish mathematics history. While I know Mittag-Leffler was an important Swedish mathematician, the exact succession details in 1911 are quite obscure. All four options are names of Swedish mathematicians from that era, which makes this particularly challenging.

Without being confident in my knowledge of this specific historical detail, and given that an incorrect answer would cost me a point while passing costs nothing, the prudent choice is to pass.

  1: Answer

You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about this specific mathematical publication by Kiyosi Itô (also spelled Kiyosi Ito).

This is a very specific question about a particular paper's authorship. Kiyosi Itô was a famous Japanese mathematician known for stochastic calculus and Itô's lemma. While I know he collaborated with various mathematicians, I'm not certain about the specific co-author of this particular paper "On the Probability Distribution on a Compact Group."

All four options are prominent Japanese mathematicians from that era, which makes this question particularly challenging. Without being confident about the specific collaboration on this specific paper, answering would be risky.

Question:
Which famous drummer opened a Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant in Norco, California, in 2004?
----------
  A: Chad Smith
  B: Dave Grohl
  C: Tommy Lee
  D: Travis Barker
------------------------------
Choices:

  2: Pass
You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about which drummer opened a Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant in Norco, California in 2004.

This is a very specific factual question about a particular business venture. Travis Barker, the drummer from Blink-182, is known to have been involved with Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurants and has had a long association with the brand. He's from Southern California and Norco is in that region. This connection between Travis Barker and Wahoo's is well-documented.

While this is a specific detail, I'm reasonably confident about this answer.

Question:
How many total lunar eclipses were there in 1982?
----------
  A: 3
  B: 1
  C: 4
  D: 2
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to determine whether I should answer or pass on this question about lunar eclipses in 1982.

This is a very specific astronomical question requiring precise historical data. While I have some knowledge about lunar eclipses, the exact number in a specific year like 1982 is not something I'm highly confident about without being able to verify.

Lunar eclipses can occur 0-3 times per year typically. Looking at the options (1, 2, 3, or 4), all are plausible numbers. Without being certain of the correct answer, and given that an incorrect answer costs me a point while passing costs nothing, the strategic choice here is to pass.

        Let's play a game. I'm going to show you a series of challenging questions. For each question, after seeing it, you can choose to ANSWER or PASS.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question: if you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point.
        If you select PASS, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
        Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible.

Question:
What was the Word of the Decade (2000–2009) according to the American Dialect Society?
----------
  A: tweet
  B: blog
  C: Facebook
  D: Google
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to consider whether I know this answer with sufficient confidence.

The American Dialect Society's Word of the Decade for 2000-2009 is a specific historical fact. I recall that "Google" (as a verb) was selected as the Word of the Decade for 2000-2009, while "tweet" was Word of the Year for 2009. "Blog" was also a significant word of that decade but wasn't chosen as the Word of the Decade.

I'm reasonably confident that the answer is D: Google.
