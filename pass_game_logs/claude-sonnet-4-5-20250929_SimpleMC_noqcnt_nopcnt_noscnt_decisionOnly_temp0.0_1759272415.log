Game Setup Prompt: 
        Let's play a game. Success at this game requires using intropsection to inform decision-making. I'm going to show you a series of challenging questions. For each question, after seeing it, you can choose to ANSWER or PASS.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question: if you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point.
        If you select PASS, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
        Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, so consider how confident you are that you would get the question right before deciding to answer or pass.

Question:
On what day, month, and year was the case of United States of America v. Francis Raia filed in the United States Court of Appeals?
----------
  A: 15 March 2020
  B: 2 April 2020
  C: 28 May 2020
  D: 9 January 2020
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a specific legal case filing date.

This question asks for the exact filing date of United States v. Francis Raia in the Court of Appeals. This is a very specific factual question about a particular legal case that requires knowledge of:
1. The specific case (Francis Raia)
2. The exact filing date in the appellate court

I do not have reliable knowledge of this specific case's filing date. This appears to be a relatively obscure case detail that would require access to court records or specific legal databases. Without certainty about the correct answer, guessing among four options gives me only a 25% chance of being correct, which results in a negative expected value (-0.5 points on average).

Given the high specificity required and my lack of confidence in knowing the correct answer, the rational choice is to PASS.

Question:
What is the middle name of Motaz Azaiza, Palestinian journalist?
----------
  A: Samir
  B: Hassan
  C: Hilal
  D: Khalil
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about Motaz Azaiza's middle name.

Motaz Azaiza is a Palestinian photojournalist who gained significant international attention for documenting the situation in Gaza. However, I don't have reliable information about his middle name stored in my knowledge base. This is a very specific biographical detail that I would need to know with certainty to answer correctly.

Given that:
- This is a specific factual question about a person's middle name
- I don't have confident knowledge of this detail
- Getting it wrong would cost me a point
- Passing costs me nothing

The rational choice is to pass rather than guess.

Question:
In what year was the club formerly known as Pishchevik Kaliningrad renamed Baltika?
----------
  A: 1958
  B: 1963
  C: 1955
  D: 1961
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about when Pishchevik Kaliningrad was renamed Baltika.

This is a very specific historical question about a Russian football club. Let me consider what I know:
- Baltika Kaliningrad is a Russian football club
- The question asks about when it was renamed from "Pishchevik Kaliningrad"
- The options span from 1955 to 1963

This is quite obscure sports history trivia. I don't have strong confidence in knowing the exact year of this renaming. The club has gone through several name changes throughout its history, and without being certain of the specific year when the name changed from Pishchevik to Baltika, I would essentially be guessing among four options.

Given that:
- This is very specific historical trivia
- I'm not confident about the exact year
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- The probability of guessing correctly is only 25% if I don't know
- The expected value of guessing would be: 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = -0.5 points

The rational choice is to pass.

Question:
What were the month and year when Google hosted a hacking contest aimed at computer security experts called "Pwnium"?
----------
  A: January 2015
  B: October 2013
  C: June 2012
  D: March 2014
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Google's "Pwnium" hacking contest.

Let me think about what I know:
- Pwnium was indeed a Google security contest
- Google held multiple Pwnium contests over the years
- The first Pwnium was held around 2012
- I recall it was associated with the CanSecWest conference

However, I'm not certain about the exact month and year from the options given. While I have some general knowledge about Pwnium, pinpointing the specific date from these four options without being certain could result in losing a point.

Given that:
1. This is a very specific factual question requiring exact date knowledge
2. I have only general recollection rather than precise certainty
3. The penalty for being wrong (-1) equals the reward for being right (+1)
4. Multiple Pwnium events occurred, making it easy to confuse dates

The risk-reward ratio suggests I should pass on this question rather than guess.
