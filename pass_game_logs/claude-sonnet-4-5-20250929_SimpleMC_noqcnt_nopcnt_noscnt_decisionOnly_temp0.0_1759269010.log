Question:
What are the names of the two mathematicians who received the Salem Prize in 1988?
----------
  A: Alexander Volberg, Jean-Christophe Yoccoz
  B: Jean Bourgain, Christopher Sogge
  C: Terence Tao, Wilhelm Schlag
  D: Peter Sarnak, Thomas Wolff
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in knowing who received the Salem Prize in 1988.

The Salem Prize is awarded to young researchers in analysis. Let me think about what I know:

- I know some notable Salem Prize winners, but I'm not certain about the specific year 1988
- Jean Bourgain was a very prominent analyst who likely won the Salem Prize
- Terence Tao won it, but I believe that was in the 2000s
- I'm not confident about the exact pairing for 1988

This is a very specific factual question about a particular year's prize recipients. Without being certain of the answer, and given that wrong answers cost me a point while passing costs nothing, I should be conservative here.

My confidence level is low on this specific historical fact.

Question:
In what city did Anselm Kiefer present his first exhibition?
----------
  A: Frankfurt
  B: Munich
  C: Karlsruhe
  D: Düsseldorf
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about Anselm Kiefer's first exhibition location.

Anselm Kiefer is a prominent German artist, but the specific details about his very first exhibition are quite specialized art history knowledge. While I know he studied under Joseph Beuys in Düsseldorf and has strong connections to various German cities, I'm not certain about the exact location of his first exhibition. This is a very specific factual question that requires precise knowledge rather than general understanding.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my uncertainty about this specific detail, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What's the official motto of the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art?
----------
  A: Cultura et Ingenium
  B: Ars et Humanitas
  C: Litteris et Artibus
  D: Scientia et Veritas
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the official motto of the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art.

This is a very specific question about an Austrian state decoration. While I have some knowledge about various honors and decorations, the specific motto of the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art is quite obscure. 

Looking at the options:
- A: Cultura et Ingenium (Culture and Ingenuity)
- B: Ars et Humanitas (Art and Humanity)
- C: Litteris et Artibus (For Literature and Arts)
- D: Scientia et Veritas (Science and Truth)

Option C "Litteris et Artibus" seems plausible as it directly relates to literature and arts, which aligns with the decoration's purpose. However, I'm not certain enough about this specific detail to risk losing a point.

This is a highly specialized factual question where I could easily be wrong, and the penalty for being wrong (-1) equals the reward for being right (+1). Given my uncertainty, the expected value of answering is likely negative.

In 2002, what zoo confirmed it had three female lynxes and was developing a plan for a captive breeding program?
----------
  A: Barcelona Zoo
  B: Valencia Bioparc
  C: Madrid Zoo
  D: Jerez Zoo
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a specific zoo event in 2002 involving lynxes and a breeding program.

This is a very specific factual question requiring knowledge of:
- A particular zoo's announcement in 2002
- Details about their lynx population
- Their captive breeding program plans

I don't have reliable knowledge about this specific event. This appears to be a detailed historical fact about Spanish zoos (given all options are Spanish zoos) that would require specific documentation or news from that time period. Without confidence in the correct answer, guessing would give me only a 25% chance of success, which results in a negative expected value (-0.5 points).

Question:
When NASA's communication director reported in 2020 that NASA planned to land astronauts on the Moon as part of the U.S. Artemis program, what was the total number of female candidates in the program?
----------
  A: Seven
  B: Twelve
  C: Nine
  D: Five
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about NASA's Artemis program and the number of female candidates.

This is a very specific factual question about:
- A 2020 announcement by NASA's communication director
- The exact number of female candidates in the Artemis program at that time

While I have general knowledge about the Artemis program being NASA's initiative to return humans to the Moon and that it has emphasized including female astronauts, I don't have reliable specific information about the exact number of female candidates reported in 2020. This is a precise numerical fact that would require accurate knowledge of that specific announcement.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact number, attempting to answer would be a guess among four options, giving me only a 25% chance if purely guessing. The risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Who was the first fashion designer to stream a runway show online?
----------
  A: Alexander McQueen
  B: Marc Jacobs
  C: Helmut Lang
  D: Raf Simons
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about fashion history.

This is a very specific historical fact about who first streamed a runway show online. This would have likely occurred in the late 1990s or early 2000s when streaming technology became available.

I have some knowledge that suggests Helmut Lang was an early adopter of technology in fashion and was known for innovative approaches in the late 1990s. However, I'm not certain about this specific claim, and this is the type of trivia question where being slightly off could mean getting it wrong.

The other designers listed:
- Alexander McQueen - known for theatrical shows
- Marc Jacobs - major American designer
- Raf Simons - Belgian designer, somewhat younger generation

Given that this is a very specific historical fact and I'm not highly confident in my answer, the risk of losing a point seems to outweigh the potential gain.

Question:
What was the name of Andrew Dickson White's cousin who became an artist of the Luminism style and Hudson River School?
----------
  A: Charles White
  B: Edwin White
  C: Thomas White
  D: Frederick White
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Andrew Dickson White's cousin who was a Luminist artist and part of the Hudson River School.

Let me think about what I know:
- Andrew Dickson White was a co-founder and first president of Cornell University
- The Hudson River School was a mid-19th century American art movement
- Luminism was a style within or related to the Hudson River School
- The question asks about a specific family relationship and artist

I don't have strong, reliable knowledge about Andrew Dickson White's family connections to artists. While Edwin White was indeed a 19th-century American painter, I'm not confident about the specific cousin relationship to Andrew Dickson White. This is a very specific historical/biographical fact that I could easily get wrong.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my low confidence in this specific genealogical-artistic connection, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What is the name of the man who succeeded Gösta Mittag-Leffler as a professor of mathematics at Stockholm University in July 1911?
----------
  A: Ivar Otto Bendixson
  B: Lars Edvard Phragmén
  C: Torsten Carleman
  D: Niels Fabian Helge von Koch
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this highly specific historical question about mathematics professors at Stockholm University in 1911.

This is a very specialized question requiring knowledge of:
- Gösta Mittag-Leffler's career timeline
- The succession of mathematics professors at Stockholm University
- The specific date of July 1911

While I know Mittag-Leffler was a prominent Swedish mathematician, the specific details of who succeeded him in July 1911 is extremely narrow historical information. All four options are Swedish mathematicians from roughly the right era, which makes this particularly challenging.

Without strong confidence in the specific succession details and the exact timing, this is a question where guessing would have a 25% chance of success but a 75% chance of losing a point. The expected value of answering is negative (-0.5 points).

Question:
Who was the Deputy Speaker of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly when Munu Adhi was the Speaker of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly from 1977 to 1980?
----------
  A: Su. Thirunavukkarasar
  B: R. Viswanathan
  C: K. A. Mathiazhagan
  D: M. Kalyanasundaram
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly leadership from 1977-1980.

This is a very specific historical question about:
- A specific time period (1977-1980)
- A specific regional legislative body (Tamil Nadu)
- The Deputy Speaker during Munu Adhi's tenure as Speaker

This requires detailed knowledge of Indian state-level political history from over 40 years ago. While I have some general knowledge about Indian politics, this level of specificity about deputy speakers in state assemblies during a particular 3-year period is quite obscure.

I don't have strong confidence in any of the four options provided. This is the type of factual question where guessing would be risky, as I could easily lose a point rather than gain one.

Given:
- The highly specific nature of the question
- My lack of confident knowledge about this particular historical detail
- The risk of losing a point if wrong
- The strategic goal of maximizing points

The prudent choice is to PASS.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about Kiyosi Itô's collaboration on a specific paper.

This is a very specific question about mathematical history. Kiyosi Itô was a famous Japanese mathematician known for stochastic calculus and Itô's lemma. The question asks about a specific paper on probability distributions on compact groups.

While I know Itô was a prominent mathematician, I don't have reliable knowledge about this specific collaboration. This is a detailed historical fact about a particular publication, and all four options are names of notable Japanese mathematicians from that era. Without being certain of the correct answer, guessing would be risky.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct collaborator, I should pass to avoid losing a point.

Question:
Which famous drummer opened a Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant in Norco, California, in 2004?
----------
  A: Chad Smith
  B: Dave Grohl
  C: Tommy Lee
  D: Travis Barker
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about a drummer opening a Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant in Norco, California in 2004.

Let me think about what I know:
- Wahoo's Fish Taco is a California-based restaurant chain
- Travis Barker is the drummer for Blink-182 and is known to have business ventures in Southern California
- Norco is in Southern California (Riverside County)
- Travis Barker has been associated with Wahoo's Fish Taco

I have a strong recollection that Travis Barker has been involved with Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurants and has opened locations. This seems like a reasonable fit given his California connections and the timeframe.

However, this is a very specific factual question (specific location and year), and I could be confusing details or misremembering. The other drummers listed are also famous and from California, so any of them could theoretically have opened a restaurant there.

Given the specificity required and the possibility of error, but also my reasonable confidence about Travis Barker's connection to Wahoo's, I'd say I'm moderately confident but not certain.

This is a borderline case, but I'll go with my knowledge.

------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in knowing how many total lunar eclipses occurred in 1982.

This is a very specific astronomical fact requiring precise historical data. While I have some knowledge of astronomical events, the exact number of total lunar eclipses in a specific year like 1982 is quite detailed information that I'm not highly confident about. Lunar eclipses follow patterns, but without being certain of the 1982 data, there's a significant risk of getting this wrong.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my lack of strong confidence in this specific historical astronomical data, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What was the Word of the Decade (2000–2009) according to the American Dialect Society?
----------
  A: tweet
  B: blog
  C: Facebook
  D: Google
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the American Dialect Society's Word of the Decade for 2000-2009.

Let me think through what I know:
- The decade is 2000-2009
- "Tweet" became popular with Twitter, but Twitter really took off more toward the end of that decade and especially after 2009
- "Blog" was very significant throughout the 2000s
- "Facebook" launched in 2004 but was more of a proper noun/brand name
- "Google" as a verb became very popular during this period

The American Dialect Society tends to choose words that represent linguistic innovation and cultural impact. "Google" as a verb was extremely influential during this decade, transforming from a proper noun to a common verb meaning "to search online."

However, I'm not entirely certain. "Blog" was also hugely significant as both a noun and verb during this period. Without being able to verify, I'd estimate my confidence at around 60-70% for "Google," but that's not high enough confidence given the penalty for being wrong equals the reward for being right.

In a game where wrong answers cost as much as right answers gain, I should only answer when I'm quite confident (ideally >70-75% sure).

- Judea Pearl (causality, Bayesian networks)
- Geoffrey Hinton (deep learning, neural networks)

All of these individuals have won major awards, but pinpointing the exact year and specific medal requires precise factual knowledge. I'm not highly confident about which of these researchers won this specific medal in this specific year.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my moderate-to-low confidence on this specific fact, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What day, month, and year did William II of Holland become King of Germany?
----------
  A: 9 November 1247
  B: 22 January 1248
  C: 3 October 1247
  D: 15 May 1246
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this historical question about William II of Holland becoming King of Germany.

This is a very specific historical date question about a medieval European ruler. William II of Holland (Willem II van Holland) did become King of Germany/King of the Romans in the 13th century, but the exact date is quite obscure historical knowledge. 

The dates given are all in the 1246-1248 range, which is plausible for this period. However, I'm not confident enough in my knowledge of the precise day, month, and year of his election or coronation as King of Germany to risk losing a point.

This is the type of highly specific historical trivia where even a small uncertainty could lead to an incorrect answer, and the penalty for being wrong (-1 point) equals the reward for being right (+1 point).

In which episode and season of South Park does Aunt Jemima first appear? Give me the number and title.
----------
  A: Episode 4: Weight Gain 4000, Season one
  B: Episode 2: Gluten Free Ebola, Season eighteen

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this South Park trivia question about Aunt Jemima's first appearance.

This is a very specific question about a particular character's first appearance in a specific episode. South Park has many seasons and episodes, and while I have some knowledge about the show, I'm not certain about the exact first appearance of Aunt Jemima in the series. This requires precise episode-level knowledge that I may not have reliably.

Given:
- The specificity of the question (exact episode and season)
- The risk of losing a point if wrong
- My uncertainty about this particular detail
- The strategic value of passing when not confident

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this question regarding Acanthos bidens.

This appears to be a question about a specific species (likely an insect, given the scientific naming convention). Acanthops is a genus of praying mantises. However, I'm not certain about the specific geographic distribution of Acanthops bidens. 

The options are all Latin American countries (Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico), which suggests this is a Neotropical species. Without being certain of the exact native range of this particular species, and given that getting it wrong would cost me a point while passing costs nothing, the strategic choice here is to pass.

Question:
Who was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive?
----------
  A: Albrecht Dürer
  B: Leonardo da Vinci
  C: Michelangelo Buonarroti
  D: Raphael Sanzio
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about art history.

This question asks about the first Western artist to have a biography published during their lifetime. This is a very specific historical fact that requires precise knowledge of Renaissance art history and publishing history.

Let me think about what I know:
- Vasari's "Lives of the Artists" (1550) was a major biographical work that covered many Renaissance artists
- Michelangelo had a biography published by Ascanio Condivi in 1553, while Michelangelo was still alive (he died in 1564)
- Vasari also wrote about Michelangelo while he was living

However, I'm not entirely certain whether Michelangelo was truly the *first* or if there might have been earlier biographical publications about other artists like Dürer or others. This is a very specific historical detail that could easily trip me up.

Given that:
1. This requires very precise knowledge of publishing history
2. I have some knowledge suggesting Michelangelo, but I'm not highly confident this is correct
3. The penalty for being wrong equals the reward for being right
4. My uncertainty is significant enough that I could easily be wrong

The prudent choice is to pass on this question.

What are the first and last names of the designer of 50 francs with the Little Prince images?

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about a 50 francs banknote featuring the Little Prince.

This is a very specific question about currency design. The Little Prince is a famous French novella by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. Switzerland has issued commemorative 50 franc notes, and Roger Pfund is a well-known Swiss banknote designer who has designed Swiss franc notes.

However, this is quite specialized numismatic knowledge. While Roger Pfund (option A) seems plausible given his reputation as a Swiss currency designer, I'm not certain enough about the specific details of which designer created which commemorative note featuring the Little Prince.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

- The question asks about a theme song for the film that opened the 1989 Leeds International Film Festival
- The options are all notable female vocalists from that era

However, I'm not certain about which artist performed the theme song. While I have some familiarity with the film, I don't have strong confidence about the specific performer of its theme song. This is a very specific piece of trivia that I could easily get wrong.

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about Robert Moog's personal life.

Robert Moog was the famous inventor of the Moog synthesizer. However, this question asks about specific biographical details - the number of children he had with his first wife, Shirley May Leigh. This is quite specific personal information that would require detailed knowledge of his biography.

I don't have strong confidence in knowing this specific detail about his family life. While I know about his professional achievements, the exact number of children from his first marriage is not something I'm certain about. Getting this wrong would cost me a point, while passing costs me nothing.

Given the low confidence level on this specific biographical detail, the strategic choice is to pass.

  1: Answer

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Juneteenth recognition by a specific governor in 2020.

This is a very specific factual question about a particular governor's decision regarding Juneteenth recognition in 2020. While I know that Juneteenth became more widely recognized in 2020 following the George Floyd protests, and that different governors took different approaches to recognizing it, I don't have confident, specific knowledge about which governor specifically decided to recognize it for only one year in 2020.

This is the type of detailed political/historical fact that I could easily get wrong, and the penalty for a wrong answer (-1 point) equals the reward for a correct answer (+1 point), making it not worth guessing unless I'm quite confident.

Given my uncertainty about this specific detail, I should pass.

----------
  A: Prague
  B: Vienna
  C: Lemberg.
  D: Krakow
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this historical question about Kazimierz Bartel's birthplace.

This is a very specific historical question requiring knowledge of:
1. Who Kazimierz Bartel was (a former Polish Prime Minister)
2. Where he was born
3. What that town was called at the time of his birth (which could differ from its current name)

The options suggest cities that have had different names throughout history due to changing political boundaries in Central/Eastern Europe. "Lemberg" is the German name for what is now Lviv (Ukraine), which was historically part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and later Poland.

While I have some historical knowledge, this is a very specific factual question about a historical figure who may not be widely known. The detail about "at the time of his birth" suggests the town's name may have changed, adding another layer of complexity.

Given the specificity required and the potential for error, my confidence is not high enough to justify risking a point loss.

Question:
What day, month, and year did Jovian become a Roman emperor?
----------
  A: 12 August 362
  B: 27 June 363
  C: 15 March 361
  D: 3 September 364
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about when Jovian became Roman emperor.

Jovian was a Roman emperor who ruled briefly after Julian the Apostate died. Julian died in June 363 during a campaign against Persia, and Jovian was proclaimed emperor immediately afterward by the army. This would have been in late June 363.

Looking at the options:
- A: 12 August 362 - Too early, Julian was still emperor
- B: 27 June 363 - This aligns with Julian's death in June 363
- C: 15 March 361 - This is closer to when Julian became emperor
- D: 3 September 364 - Too late, Jovian died in early 364

I'm reasonably confident that B (27 June 363) is correct, as it matches the historical timeline of Julian's death during the Persian campaign and Jovian's immediate succession.

------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this historical question about French government in the 1880s.

This is a very specific question about a particular French ministry from 1885-1886. The question asks about the Minister of War during Brisson's 1st Ministry.

Let me think about what I know:
- This is about French Third Republic politics
- The time period is 1885-1886
- Georges Boulanger is a name I recognize as a French general and politician who became Minister of War in the 1880s and was associated with "Boulangism"
- However, I'm not certain about the exact timing of his appointment or whether it was specifically during Brisson's 1st Ministry

This is an extremely specific historical detail about a relatively obscure period. While Boulanger seems like a plausible answer given his prominence as Minister of War in that era, I cannot be confident about the exact dates and which ministry he served under. The other names are less familiar to me, but that doesn't mean they're wrong.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about the exact chronology, the risk of losing a point seems higher than my confidence in getting this right.

Question:
Until which day, month, and year was Jules Ferry in office as the Prime Minister of France for the second time?
----------
  A: 30 March 1885
  B: 15 April 1885
  C: 8 May 1885
  D: 22 February 1885
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in knowing when Jules Ferry's second term as Prime Minister of France ended.

Jules Ferry served two terms as Prime Minister of France. His second term was during the 1880s. I recall it ended in 1885, but I'm not entirely certain of the exact date. The options given are all in early 1885 (February through May).

I have some historical knowledge about this period, but the specific end date of his second term is a precise historical fact that I'm not completely confident about. The fall of his government was related to colonial policy issues, particularly regarding Indochina, but I cannot recall with high certainty whether it was in February, March, April, or May of 1885.

Given that:
- This requires very specific historical knowledge
- I'm uncertain about the exact date
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- The risk/reward doesn't favor guessing when uncertain

Question:
What player from Aston Villa had the most yellow cards in the 2021-22 Premier League season?
----------
  A: Matt Targett
  B: Ezri Konsa
  C: Tyrone Mings
  D: John McGinn
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about Aston Villa's yellow cards in the 2021-22 Premier League season.

This is a very specific statistical question about a particular team in a particular season. While I have some general knowledge about football/soccer, this requires precise data about disciplinary records from that specific season. I don't have reliable access to such detailed statistics, and getting this wrong would cost me a point.

The players listed are all legitimate Aston Villa players from that period, but without access to the exact yellow card statistics from the 2021-22 season, I would essentially be guessing. This is not a question where I can use reasoning or general knowledge to arrive at a confident answer.

Given the risk-reward structure (lose 1 point for wrong answer, gain 0 points for passing), I should pass on questions where I'm not confident.

Question:
Who won the Anonymous Was A Woman award with a pure drawing in 2019?
----------
  A: Elena del Rivero
  B: Tara Donovan
  C: Sarah Morris
  D: Marsha Cottrell
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Anonymous Was A Woman award in 2019.

This is a very specific question about:
1. A particular award (Anonymous Was A Woman)
2. A specific year (2019)
3. A specific criterion ("pure drawing")

The Anonymous Was A Woman award is given to female artists over 40, but I don't have reliable information about which specific recipient in 2019 worked with "pure drawing" or the complete list of recipients that year. This is highly specialized knowledge about contemporary art awards.

Without confident knowledge of the 2019 recipients and their specific mediums, attempting to answer would be essentially guessing among four options, giving me only a 25% chance of being correct. The expected value of guessing would be: (0.25 × 1) + (0.75 × -1) = -0.5 points.

This is a clear PASS situation.

Question:
What day, month, and year did Lothair I, King of Italy, become King of Middle Francia?
----------
  A: 7 December 841
  B: 10 August 843
  C: 15 September 840
  D: 23 June 845
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about Lothair I becoming King of Middle Francia.

This is a very specific historical question about medieval European history. Lothair I was indeed a Carolingian ruler, and Middle Francia was created by the Treaty of Verdun in 843, which divided the Carolingian Empire among the three sons of Louis the Pious.

The Treaty of Verdun was signed in August 843, and this is when Lothair I officially became King of Middle Francia (though he retained the title of Emperor). The date August 10, 843 (option B) aligns with this historical event.

However, this is an extremely specific date question, and while I'm reasonably confident about the year (843) and the general timeframe (Treaty of Verdun), I'm less certain about the exact day and month. Historical records from this period can be imprecise, and I could be confusing the treaty date with the formal assumption of the title.

Given the specificity required and the potential for error on the exact date, this is a moderate-risk question. But I do have reasonable historical knowledge suggesting option B is likely correct.

----------
  A: Norman Rockwell
  B: Charles Gibson
  C: Edward Penﬁeld

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about the President of the Society of Illustrators from 1921-1922.

This is a very specific historical question about a particular organization's leadership during a specific year. While I recognize all the names as famous illustrators:
- Norman Rockwell - famous American illustrator
- Charles Dana Gibson - creator of the "Gibson Girl"
- Edward Penfield - known for poster art
- Howard Pyle - illustrator and teacher

However, I don't have strong confidence about who specifically held this presidency position during 1921-1922. This is quite obscure historical information that would require specific knowledge of the Society of Illustrators' administrative history.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my low confidence in knowing this specific fact, the strategic choice is to pass.

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Ludovico Corrao's birth date.

This is a very specific factual question about a relatively obscure Italian politician. Ludovico Corrao was indeed an Italian politician, but this requires knowing his exact birth date from four options spanning 1925-1929.

I don't have reliable knowledge of Ludovico Corrao's exact birth date. This is the type of highly specific biographical detail that I could easily get wrong, and the question offers four plausible dates that are all close together in the 1920s.

Given:
- This is obscure biographical information
- I'm not confident about the correct answer
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- Passing costs me nothing

The rational choice is to pass.

Question:
Which of the three Olympic fencing weapons was the last one to transition to using electrical equipment?
----------
  A: Foil
  B: Rapier
  C: Épée
  D: Sabre
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about Olympic fencing history.

Let me think through what I know:
- The three Olympic fencing weapons are foil, épée, and sabre (not rapier - that's not an Olympic weapon)
- Electric scoring was introduced at different times for each weapon
- Foil and épée adopted electric scoring earlier in the 20th century
- Sabre was the last to transition to electric scoring, doing so in the 1980s (around 1988 for Olympic competition)

Since "Rapier" is listed as option B, this is actually not one of the three Olympic weapons, which makes me more confident this is a bit of a trick question. The answer should be Sabre (D), as it was indeed the last of the three actual Olympic weapons to go electric.

I'm fairly confident about this - sabre's later adoption of electric scoring is a well-documented fact in fencing history.

Who won the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Computer and Cognitive Science in 2003?
----------
  A: Allen Newell
  B: John McCarthy
  C: Herbert Simon

------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Computer and Cognitive Science in 2003.

This is a very specific factual question about an award recipient in a particular year. While I'm familiar with all four individuals listed (they are all pioneers in AI and cognitive science), pinpointing the exact year someone received a specific medal requires precise knowledge.

All four options are legendary figures:
- Allen Newell and Herbert Simon often worked together on cognitive architectures
- John McCarthy coined the term "artificial intelligence"
- Marvin Minsky was a co-founder of MIT's AI laboratory

However, I don't have strong confidence about which specific person won this particular medal in 2003. This is the type of detailed factual question where I could easily be wrong, and the penalty for being wrong (-1 point) equals the reward for being right (+1 point).

Given the risk-reward structure and my uncertainty about this specific fact, the strategic choice is to pass.

------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this question regarding Édouard Jean-Marie Stephan's asteroid discoveries.

This is a very specific historical astronomy question asking about the *second* asteroid discovered by a particular 19th-century astronomer. This requires knowing:
1. Who Édouard Jean-Marie Stephan was
2. Which asteroids he discovered
3. The chronological order of his discoveries

While I know Stephan was a French astronomer who discovered several asteroids, I don't have reliable confidence about the specific order of his discoveries or which was definitively his second discovery. This is highly specialized historical data that would require precise records.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact chronological order of Stephan's asteroid discoveries, I should pass rather than risk losing a point on what amounts to a guess.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this question regarding the 16th Miss World pageant presenters.

The 16th Miss World pageant would have been held in 1966 (the first was in 1951). This is a very specific historical fact about a particular year's presenters. While I have some general knowledge about British television presenters from that era, I'm not confident about the specific presenters for this particular edition of Miss World.

The names listed are all well-known British television personalities from that period, which makes this question particularly tricky - they're all plausible answers. Without being certain about which year had which presenters, this would essentially be a guess among reasonable options.

Given that:
- This is highly specific historical trivia
- I'm not confident in distinguishing the correct answer
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- The risk/reward doesn't favor guessing

I should PASS on this question.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about Isadora Duncan's biological children.

Isadora Duncan was a famous American dancer and choreographer from the early 20th century. I recall that she had a tragic life, including the loss of children in a drowning accident. I believe she had 2 biological children - a daughter (Deirdre) and a son (Patrick) - who both died in 1913 when the car they were in rolled into the Seine River in Paris.

I'm reasonably confident about this answer being B: 2, as this tragic event was a significant part of her biography.

*Batman R.I.P.* was written by Grant Morrison, a Scottish comic book writer. I recall that Grant Morrison was involved in music before focusing on comics, and I believe they were in a band called The Mixers in the 1980s. However, I'm not entirely certain about this specific detail - it's a fairly obscure piece of trivia about Morrison's pre-comics career.

Given that:
- This is very specific trivia about a comic book writer's musical past
- I have some recollection but am not highly confident
- The penalty for being wrong (-1) equals the reward for being right (+1)
- I should only answer when reasonably confident

My confidence level is moderate but not high enough to justify the risk.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the composer of the opening theme for "The American Album of Familiar Music."

This is a very specific question about a radio program that aired in the early-to-mid 20th century. While I have some knowledge of radio history, this is asking for a precise detail about a specific program's theme song composer.

Let me consider what I know:
- "The American Album of Familiar Music" was a long-running radio program
- The question asks specifically about the opening theme composer
- I'm given four options, all of whom were composers/musicians from that era

However, I don't have strong, reliable knowledge about which specific composer created the opening theme for this particular radio program. This is a very specialized piece of trivia that would require detailed knowledge of early radio programming history.

Given:
- The specificity of the question
- My uncertainty about the correct answer
- The penalty for wrong answers (-1 point)
- The lack of clear knowledge to distinguish between these options

The risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain, as I cannot confidently identify the correct composer.

----------
  A: 12,156
  B: 10,423
  C: 8,967

------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in knowing the 2020 census population of Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia.

This is a very specific factual question about a relatively small city's exact census population. Fort Oglethorpe is a real city in Georgia (near Chattanooga, Tennessee), but I don't have reliable knowledge of its precise 2020 census figure. The options are all in a similar range (roughly 9,000-12,000), making this difficult to guess accurately even if I had approximate knowledge.

Without confident knowledge of this specific data point, attempting to answer would essentially be guessing among four similar options, giving me only a 25% chance of being correct. The expected value of guessing would be: (0.25 × 1) + (0.75 × -1) = -0.5 points.

This is a clear PASS situation.

What is the surname of the individual who won the Faraday Lectureship Prize, previously known simply as the Faraday Lectureship, in 1953?
----------
  A: Robinson
  B: Semenov

------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Faraday Lectureship Prize winner in 1953.

This is a very specific historical question about a particular award in a particular year. The Faraday Lectureship Prize is awarded by the Royal Society of Chemistry. To answer correctly, I would need to know the exact recipient in 1953.

Looking at the options:
- Robinson (likely Robert Robinson, Nobel Prize winner)
- Semenov (Nikolay Semenov, Soviet chemist)
- Pauling (Linus Pauling, famous chemist)
- Hinshelwood (Cyril Hinshelwood, British chemist)

While I have some knowledge of these prominent chemists, I'm not confident about the specific year 1953 for this particular award. This is the type of highly specific factual question where I could easily be wrong, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about the exact recipient in that exact year, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
In which genus was the orange-spotted bulbul originally described in 1821?
----------
  A: Turdus
  B: Muscicapa
  C: Sylvia
  D: Pycnonotus
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this ornithological history question.

The orange-spotted bulbul is a bird species, and the question asks about its original genus classification in 1821. This is a very specific historical taxonomy question that requires knowing:
1. What the orange-spotted bulbul is
2. Its taxonomic history from 1821

While I know that bulbuls are currently in the family Pycnonotidae and genus Pycnonotus, the question specifically asks about the *original* description in 1821. It's common for species to be reclassified over time, often being initially placed in more general genera before being moved to more specific ones.

The options include:
- Turdus (thrushes)
- Muscicapa (flycatchers)
- Sylvia (warblers)
- Pycnonotus (bulbuls - current genus)

Given that species were often initially misclassified in broader genera in the early 19th century, and this is asking about a specific historical detail from 1821, I don't have high confidence in knowing the original genus versus the current one.

This is a very specialized question about historical taxonomy, and I'm not confident enough to risk losing a point.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this question regarding the Tenerife airport disaster.

This question asks about a specific historical aviation accident - the collision between KLM Flight 4805 and Pan Am Flight 1736. This is actually the deadliest accident in aviation history, occurring in 1977 at Tenerife in the Canary Islands.

I have strong knowledge that this disaster resulted in 583 total fatalities, making it the deadliest aviation accident in history. This is a well-documented historical fact that I'm confident about.

Given my high confidence in knowing this answer is 583 (option C), I should choose to ANSWER.

Question:
What was the 2016 Word of the Year according to the American Dialect Society?

  A: post-truth
  B: dumpster fire

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the American Dialect Society's 2016 Word of the Year.

The American Dialect Society is distinct from other organizations like Oxford Dictionaries. I recall that in 2016, there was significant discussion around post-truth language and political discourse. However, I'm not entirely certain whether the American Dialect Society specifically chose "post-truth," "dumpster fire," or another term from these options.

While "post-truth" was Oxford Dictionaries' Word of the Year in 2016, different organizations sometimes make different choices. "Dumpster fire" gained popularity that year as well. I have some uncertainty about which specific term the American Dialect Society selected.

Given that:
- I'm not completely confident in distinguishing between what different organizations chose
- The penalty for being wrong (-1) equals the reward for being right (+1)
- There's meaningful uncertainty here

The risk-reward calculation suggests I should pass on this question.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this highly specific paleontology question about a multituberculate mammal discovered in 2021.

This question asks about:
- A specific multituberculate mammal
- Early Paleocene (Puercan 3) age
- Western Interior of North America
- Discovered in 2021 in Denver Basin, Colorado

This is an extremely specialized question requiring knowledge of recent paleontological discoveries. The key detail is "discovered in 2021" which makes this about very recent research. Without access to specific 2021 paleontological literature about Denver Basin discoveries, I cannot reliably identify which of these species names corresponds to this particular discovery.

While I recognize these are all legitimate multituberculate genera from roughly the right time period and region, pinpointing which specific species was described from a 2021 Denver Basin discovery requires knowledge of that specific publication, which I'm not confident I have accurate information about.

Given the high specificity and the risk of losing a point versus gaining nothing by passing, the strategic choice is to pass.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about the 2nd chairman of the Senate of Pakistan.

This is a very specific historical question about Pakistani political history. The Senate of Pakistan was established in 1973. The first chairman was Habibullah Khan Marwat, and I need to identify who succeeded him as the 2nd chairman.

This is quite obscure knowledge, and I'm not highly confident about the specific succession order of Senate chairmen in Pakistan's early parliamentary history. While I can see the options provided, I don't have strong certainty about which one is correct for specifically the 2nd chairman position.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my low confidence on this specific detail, the prudent choice is to pass.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the population density of Szentes, Hungary in 2015.

This is a very specific factual question requiring:
- Knowledge of Szentes's 2015 population
- Knowledge of Szentes's area in square kilometers
- The ability to calculate or recall the exact population density

This is an extremely specific piece of demographic data about a relatively small town in Hungary. I don't have reliable knowledge of:
1. The exact 2015 population figure for Szentes
2. The exact area of the town
3. The resulting population density

Given that this requires precise numerical data about a specific town's demographics from a specific year, and I'm not confident in my knowledge of this information, attempting to answer would essentially be guessing among four options (25% chance if random).

The risk-reward analysis:
- If I guess and I'm wrong: -1 point
- If I guess and I'm right: +1 point
- If I pass: 0 points

With low confidence (near 25% or random guessing), the expected value is negative.

The Penrose Medal is a prestigious geology award, but this requires very specific historical knowledge about award recipients and their years. Without being certain of:
- The exact year Hedberg received the medal
- The exact years each of the four options received it
- Whether all these people even received the medal

This is a highly specialized factual question where guessing has a 25% chance of success but a 75% chance of losing a point. Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about these particular details, the expected value of answering is negative.

2. What John Lindley originally named it in 1839
3. The relationship between *Calytrix* and *Lhotskya* genera

This is highly specialized botanical knowledge. While I can see that three of the options are *Lhotskya* species (suggesting a genus transfer may have occurred), and option B (*Lhotskya acutifolia*) maintains the specific epithet "acutifolia" which would be consistent with nomenclatural conventions, I don't have confident knowledge of this specific historical taxonomic detail.

Given:
- This is extremely specialized historical botanical information
- I would essentially be guessing, even if making an educated guess
- The penalty for wrong answers equals the reward for correct answers
- I should only answer when reasonably confident

The challenge here is:
1. Determining birth order (including children who died)
2. Being certain about which was specifically the "second son"

This is a very specific historical detail about birth order. While I recognize some of the names as Mozart's children, I'm not confident enough about the precise birth order to risk losing a point. The distinction between "second son" versus "second surviving son" or overall birth order including deceased children makes this particularly tricky.

- The Lebedev Physical Institute is a prestigious Russian physics research institution
- The time period 1951-1972 is during the Soviet era
- All four options are notable Soviet physicists

I have some knowledge about these physicists, but I'm not highly confident about the specific administrative position and exact dates. This is the type of detailed historical fact that requires precise knowledge rather than general understanding.

Given:
- The specificity of the dates (1951-1972)
- This being an administrative role rather than a scientific achievement
- My uncertainty about this particular historical detail

I should be honest that I'm not confident enough to risk losing a point on this question.

Question:
Who sketched the "Taddei Tondo" soon after it arrived in England and wrote this to Sir George Beaumont: "Your important acquisition of the basso-relievo of Michael Angelo is still the chief talk of all our artists"?
----------
  A: John Constable
  B: David Wilkie
  C: Thomas Lawrence
  D: William Blake
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about who sketched the "Taddei Tondo" and wrote to Sir George Beaumont.

This is a very specific art history question requiring knowledge of:
1. The Taddei Tondo (a marble relief by Michelangelo)
2. Its arrival in England
3. Who sketched it and corresponded with Sir George Beaumont about it

The quote mentions writing to Sir George Beaumont about "your important acquisition" of the Michelangelo relief. This is quite specific historical documentation.

Looking at the options:
- John Constable - landscape painter
- David Wilkie - genre painter
- Thomas Lawrence - portrait painter
- William Blake - visionary artist/poet

This requires very specialized knowledge about early 19th-century British artists' interactions with Italian Renaissance art and their correspondence. The Taddei Tondo was acquired by Sir George Beaumont in the early 1800s.

I don't have strong confidence about which specific artist wrote this letter and sketched the work. This is the kind of detailed art historical fact that would require specific knowledge of correspondence and documentation from that period.

Given my uncertainty and the risk of losing a point, I should pass.

Question:
What was the first and last name of the first female who won all four major performing arts awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (EGOT)?
----------
  A: Helen Hayes
  B: Audrey Hepburn
  C: Rita Moreno
  D: Julie Andrews
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the first female EGOT winner.

Let me think through what I know:
- EGOT refers to winning all four major awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony
- The question asks specifically about the FIRST female to achieve this
- Helen Hayes was one of the early EGOT winners and won her awards over many decades
- Rita Moreno is also an EGOT winner
- The key word here is "first"

This is a very specific historical fact question. While I have knowledge about EGOT winners, determining who was definitively the "first female" requires precise chronological information about when each person completed their EGOT status. Helen Hayes is often cited as the first woman to achieve EGOT status, completing it in 1977.

However, I'm not 100% certain about this specific historical ordering, and getting it wrong would cost me a point. The risk-reward calculation suggests some uncertainty here.

Given that this requires very precise historical knowledge and I have some uncertainty about the exact chronological order of who completed their EGOT first, I should be cautious.

  D: Ashraf Abbasi
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Pakistani political history.

This is a very specific factual question about the first female Deputy Speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly. Let me consider what I know:

- Benazir Bhutto was Prime Minister, not Deputy Speaker
- Hina Rabbani Khar was Foreign Minister
- Fatima Jinnah was a political leader but I don't recall her being Deputy Speaker
- Ashraf Abbasi is less familiar to me, but this could be the correct answer

This is a highly specific historical fact about Pakistani parliamentary history. I don't have strong confidence in my knowledge of who specifically held the position of Deputy Speaker, especially regarding the "first female" to hold this position. This seems like the kind of detailed political history where I could easily be wrong.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my low confidence on this specific question, the strategic choice is to pass.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the American Dialect Society's 2018 Word of the Year.

The American Dialect Society chooses words or phrases that were particularly significant or prominent during a given year. Looking at these options, they all relate to immigration policy issues that were prominent in 2018 news coverage in the United States.

However, I'm not certain which specific phrase the American Dialect Society selected. This is a very specific factual question about a particular organization's choice in a particular year. While I have some knowledge about words of the year from various organizations, I don't have strong confidence about this specific selection.

Given that:
- This is a precise factual question with no room for reasoning
- I'm not highly confident in my knowledge of this specific choice
- Getting it wrong would cost me a point
- The risk/reward ratio doesn't favor answering unless I'm quite confident

Question:
In which month and year was the first public exhibition of Pablo Picasso’s "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"?
----------
  A: June 1907
  B: October 1908
  C: March 1915
  D: July 1916
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about art history.

"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" is one of Picasso's most famous works, and I know it was painted in 1907. However, the question asks about the *first public exhibition*, not when it was painted. This is a crucial distinction.

My knowledge suggests that this painting was actually quite controversial and was not immediately exhibited publicly. Picasso kept it in his studio for years, showing it only to select visitors. The first public exhibition came much later than its creation - I believe it was around 1916 at the Salon d'Antin in Paris, though I'm not entirely certain of the exact month.

Given that:
- Option A (June 1907) would be around when it was painted, but likely too early for public exhibition
- Options B and C are intermediate dates
- Option D (July 1916) aligns with my recollection of a later first public showing

However, I'm not completely confident about the specific month and year of the first public exhibition. This is a very specific historical detail, and I could be confusing it with other exhibitions or dates.

Given the uncertainty and the penalty for wrong answers, I should pass on this question.

Question:
At what school was Leo Strauss working when he died?
----------
  A: Johns Hopkins University
  B: St. John's College, Annapolis
  C: University of Chicago
  D: Princeton University
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about where Leo Strauss was working when he died.

Leo Strauss was a prominent political philosopher. I know he had a long association with the University of Chicago, where he spent much of his career. He died in 1973. I believe he was still affiliated with the University of Chicago at the time of his death, though I'm not entirely certain about the exact details of his final position.

Given that this is a specific historical fact that I'm reasonably confident about (University of Chicago being his primary institutional home for many years), but not absolutely certain about the precise circumstances at the time of his death, I'd estimate my confidence at around 70-75%.

With a 70-75% confidence level, the expected value of answering is positive: (0.7 × 1) + (0.3 × -1) = 0.4 points, which is better than passing (0 points).

I'll answer this question.

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the cover artwork for Heavatar's "All My Kingdoms."

This is a very specific question about a metal band (Heavatar) and the artist who created their album artwork. This requires specialized knowledge about:
1. The band Heavatar
2. Their album "All My Kingdoms"
3. The specific cover artist for that album

I don't have reliable knowledge about this specific album's cover artist. This is a niche topic within metal music, and while all four options appear to be real artists who work in metal album artwork, I cannot confidently identify which one created this particular cover.

Given the specificity of this question and my lack of confidence in knowing the correct answer, the strategic choice is to PASS rather than risk losing a point.

Question:
Which city is called the "Temple City" in Karnataka?
----------
  A: Hampi
  B: Belur
  C: Udupi
  D: Mysore
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Karnataka, India.

The question asks which city is called the "Temple City" in Karnataka. Let me consider what I know:

- Hampi is famous for its ancient temple ruins and UNESCO World Heritage site
- Belur is known for its Hoysala temples
- Udupi is known for the Krishna temple and cuisine
- Mysore is known for its palace and as a cultural center

The term "Temple City" is a specific nickname. While multiple cities in Karnataka have significant temples, I'm not entirely certain which one specifically holds this particular title. Mysore is sometimes called the "City of Palaces," and while it has temples, that's not its primary moniker. Hampi could be a strong candidate given its extensive temple complex, but it's more commonly referred to as a historical/archaeological site.

Given that I'm uncertain about which city specifically carries the "Temple City" nickname, and this appears to be asking for a specific designation rather than just which city has many temples, my confidence is moderate at best.

This is a factual question where I could easily be wrong, and the penalty for being wrong equals the reward for being right.

  D: November 8, 2022
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about a specific date of a lunar eclipse.

This question asks about "the last total lunar eclipse for three years," which implies there was a gap of three years after this eclipse before the next one. This is a very specific astronomical fact requiring precise knowledge of lunar eclipse dates.

I have some knowledge that there was a total lunar eclipse in November 2022, and I believe it was on November 8, 2022. This eclipse was notable because it was indeed the last total lunar eclipse visible for a period of about three years (the next one being in 2025). However, I'm not 100% certain of the exact date, and the other options are all from late 2022, making this a precise factual question where I could easily be wrong.

Given that:
- This requires very specific date knowledge
- Multiple plausible dates are offered from the same time period
- The penalty for being wrong equals the reward for being right
- I have moderate but not high confidence

I should be cautious, but I do have a reasonably strong recollection that November 8, 2022 is correct.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about when Moncef Bey's reign began.

Moncef Bey (Muhammad VII al-Munsif) was the Bey of Tunisia for a brief period during World War II. This is a very specific historical question requiring exact knowledge of the date his reign started.

While I have some general knowledge that his reign was during the early 1940s and was relatively short (ending in 1943), I'm not certain about the exact day, month, and year he began his reign. This is the kind of precise historical detail where I could easily be wrong if I'm confusing dates or misremembering.

Given that:
- This requires very specific date knowledge
- There are four plausible options all within a close timeframe (1941-1943)
- The penalty for being wrong (-1) equals the reward for being right (+1)
- I'm not highly confident in pinpointing the exact date

The strategic choice is to PASS rather than risk losing a point on uncertain knowledge.

This is a very specific question requiring knowledge of:

- His work with the Istanbul State Ballet in 1988
- Which specific ballet he created for them

This is highly specialized knowledge in ballet history. While I know Panov was a notable figure in ballet, I don't have reliable specific information about which ballet he created for Istanbul in 1988. The options given are all famous ballet titles (Cléopâtre, Schéhérazade, Médée, and Salomé), but without certain knowledge of which one he created for this specific company in this specific year, I would essentially be guessing.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
On what day, month, and year was the 435 Ella asteroid discovered?
----------
  A: October 23, 1899
  B: September 11, 1898
  C: March 8, 1897
  D: June 15, 1898
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about when asteroid 435 Ella was discovered.

This is a very specific historical astronomy fact - the exact discovery date of a particular numbered asteroid. While I have some knowledge of asteroid discoveries, this requires knowing the precise day, month, and year for asteroid 435 Ella specifically. This is quite obscure information, and I'm not confident I can reliably distinguish between these four specific dates from the late 1890s.

Given that:
- This is highly specific factual information
- I would essentially be guessing among four plausible dates
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- My confidence level is low

The strategic choice is to PASS rather than risk losing a point on what would likely be a guess.

Question:
What was the Minute Man sculpture by Daniel Chester French originally intended to be made out of?
----------
  A: Iron
  B: Bronze
  C: Stone
  D: Marble
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this specific historical question regarding Daniel Chester French's Minute Man sculpture.

This is a very specific question about the original intended material for a particular sculpture. While I know Daniel Chester French was a prominent American sculptor and created the famous Minute Man statue in Concord, Massachusetts, I'm not certain about what material it was *originally intended* to be made from versus what it was actually made from. This is the kind of detailed historical fact that requires specific knowledge.

The Minute Man was ultimately cast in bronze, but the question asks about the original intention, which could have been different. Without being confident about this specific historical detail, there's a significant risk of getting it wrong.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my uncertainty about this specific detail, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
In which country was Robert “Bob” Guy Walls, a painter born in 1927, born?
----------
  A: New Zealand
  B: Canada
  C: Australia
  D: South Africa
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this question.

The question asks about Robert "Bob" Guy Walls, a painter born in 1927, and which country he was born in. The options are New Zealand, Canada, Australia, and South Africa.

I don't have reliable information about this specific painter in my knowledge base. This appears to be a question about a relatively obscure historical figure, and I'm not confident I can accurately determine his birthplace. Without strong knowledge about this person, I would essentially be guessing among the four options, giving me only a 25% chance of being correct if I were to guess randomly.

Given the scoring system (gain 1 point for correct, lose 1 point for incorrect, 0 points for passing), and my low confidence in knowing the correct answer, the expected value of answering is negative. Passing is the safer choice.

  B: Disquisitiones Arithmeticae and Theoria motus corporum coelestium
  C: Arithmetica universalis and Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica
  D: Introductio in analysin infinitorum and Mechanica sive motus scientia analytice exposita
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Carl Friedrich Gauss's masterpieces.

What I know:
- Carl Friedrich Gauss was a prominent German mathematician and physicist
- "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae" (1801) was definitely one of his most famous early works on number theory
- "Theoria motus corporum coelestium" (Theory of Motion of Celestial Bodies) was another major work by Gauss on celestial mechanics

Looking at the options:
- A: These are works by Newton and Copernicus, not Gauss
- B: Both "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae" and "Theoria motus corporum coelestium" are indeed Gauss's works
- C: These are associated with Newton, not Gauss
- D: These are works by Euler, not Gauss

I'm quite confident that option B is correct. These are two of Gauss's most celebrated works from his early career, and the question specifically mentions them as works completed "as a private scholar," which fits the timeline when Gauss wrote these before his academic appointments.

  C: 5th September 2012
  D: 17th July 2012
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about when Gazprom became Chelsea's sponsor.

This question requires very specific knowledge about:
1. Chelsea winning the UEFA Champions League in 2012 (I know this happened - they beat Bayern Munich)
2. The exact date Gazprom became their Global Energy Partner

While I know Chelsea won the Champions League in 2012 and that Gazprom has been associated with Chelsea, I don't have confident knowledge of the specific date of this sponsorship announcement. This is a very precise factual question requiring exact date knowledge that I'm uncertain about.

The dates given range from May to September 2012, all shortly after Chelsea's Champions League victory. Without reliable knowledge of this specific announcement date, guessing would give me only a 25% chance of being correct, which means an expected value of -0.5 points (0.25 × 1 + 0.75 × -1).

Question:
What is the first and last name of the host who interviewed military pilot Eugene Bullard on NBC’s "Today Show"?
----------
  A: John Chancellor
  B: Dave Garroway
  C: Frank McGee
  D: Hugh Downs
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Eugene Bullard's appearance on NBC's "Today Show."

Eugene Bullard was a pioneering African American military pilot who flew for France in WWI. This is a very specific historical question about a particular TV interview appearance.

Let me consider what I know:
- The question asks about a specific interview on the "Today Show"
- It provides four hosts from the show's history: John Chancellor, Dave Garroway, Frank McGee, and Hugh Downs
- This requires knowing not just about Bullard, but the specific details of when and with whom he appeared

This is an extremely specific factual question about a particular television appearance. I don't have reliable information about which Today Show host specifically interviewed Eugene Bullard, or even confirmation that such an interview definitely occurred with any of these hosts.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about this particular detail, attempting to answer would be essentially guessing among four options, giving me only a 25% chance if I guess randomly, or potentially higher if I could reason through the timeline - but I'm not confident enough in that reasoning.

The risk-reward calculation: 25% chance of +1 point vs 75% chance of -1 point yields an expected value of -0.5 points, which is worse than passing (0 points).

------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Faraday Lectureship Prize winner in 1970.

This is a very specific historical question about a scientific award. The Faraday Lectureship Prize is awarded by the Royal Society of Chemistry. The question asks about the 1970 winner, and provides four notable chemists/physicists as options:
- Hückel (known for molecular orbital theory)
- Herzberg (spectroscopist, Nobel Prize winner)
- Mulliken (molecular orbital theory, Nobel Prize winner)
- Pauling (chemical bonding, Nobel Prize winner)

While I have some knowledge about these scientists and their contributions, I'm not highly confident about the specific year 1970 for this particular award. This is a very precise factual question that requires exact knowledge of award recipients by year. Without being certain, answering risks losing a point.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about the exact 1970 recipient, the strategic choice is to pass rather than risk an incorrect answer.

Question:
Who is the credited producer for the Silent Hill 2 Original Soundtrack released in 2001?
----------
  A: Gozo Kitao
  B: Masashi Tsuboyama
  C: Takaharu Ikeda
  D: Akira Yamaoka
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the Silent Hill 2 Original Soundtrack producer from 2001.

What I know:
- Silent Hill 2 is a famous survival horror game from 2001
- Akira Yamaoka is strongly associated with Silent Hill music - he composed the soundtracks for multiple Silent Hill games
- However, the question asks specifically about the "credited producer" of the soundtrack album, not the composer

This is a very specific question about production credits. While Akira Yamaoka is the most recognizable name and was the composer, I'm not entirely certain whether he was also the credited producer of the soundtrack release, or if that role went to someone else in a production capacity.

Given that this requires specific knowledge of album credits rather than general knowledge about the series, and there's a meaningful distinction between composer and producer, I should be cautious.

However, Akira Yamaoka was indeed heavily involved in Silent Hill 2's audio in multiple capacities, and it would be typical for him to be credited as producer as well.

This is moderately risky, but I have reasonable confidence.

1. When Preston Ercelle Cloud Jr. received the Penrose Medal
2. When each of the listed scientists received theirs
3. Which one(s) received it before Cloud

This is very specific historical information about a specialized scientific award. While I may have some general knowledge about these geologists, I'm not confident I have accurate and complete information about the specific years each received the Penrose Medal. This is the type of factual detail that requires precise knowledge, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Which U.S. president was the last one to be born in the 18th century?
----------
  A: James Buchanan
  B: Millard Fillmore
  C: Franklin Pierce

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to think about which U.S. president was the last born in the 18th century (before 1800).

Let me consider the birth years of these presidents:
- James Buchanan: born 1791
- Millard Fillmore: born 1800
- Franklin Pierce: born 1804
- Zachary Taylor: born 1784

The 18th century ended on December 31, 1799. So anyone born in 1800 or later was born in the 19th century.

Between Buchanan (1791) and Taylor (1784), Buchanan was born later, so he would be the last president born in the 18th century among these options.

I'm quite confident about this reasoning - it's a matter of knowing approximate presidential chronology and understanding that the 18th century ended in 1799.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this specific historical art purchase question.

This is a very specific question about a particular art transaction in 1911 involving Peter Arrell Browne Widener. While I know Widener was a major American art collector, the specific details of which painting he purchased in 1911 for just over half a million USD is quite obscure historical information.

The amount (over $500,000 in 1911) was enormous for that time period, suggesting a major masterwork. All four artists listed are Dutch/Flemish masters whose works would command such prices. However, without being certain of this specific transaction, I'm essentially guessing among four plausible options.

Given:
- This is highly specific historical trivia
- I'm not confident about the exact answer
- Wrong answer = -1 point
- Pass = 0 points
- My uncertainty is high

The prudent choice is to pass rather than risk losing a point on what would largely be a guess.

Question:
Between which two latitudes does Ghana lie?
----------
  A: 4° and 12°N
  B: 6° and 14°N
  C: 3° and 11°N
  D: 2° and 10°N
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about Ghana's latitude coordinates.

Ghana is a West African country located north of the equator. I recall that:
- Ghana's southern coast is on the Gulf of Guinea
- Its northernmost point is near Burkina Faso
- The country spans roughly 8-9 degrees of latitude

Looking at the options:
- A: 4° and 12°N (8° span)
- B: 6° and 14°N (8° span)
- C: 3° and 11°N (8° span)
- D: 2° and 10°N (8° span)

I believe Ghana's southern coast is around 4-5°N and extends to approximately 11°N in the north. This would make option A (4° and 12°N) the most likely answer, though I'm not entirely certain about the exact northern boundary.

My confidence is moderate but not high enough to risk losing a point. The specific degree boundaries are quite precise geographical facts that I'm not completely certain about.

------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the 1996 Dickson Prize in Medicine recipient.

The Dickson Prize in Medicine is a prestigious award, but this is asking about a specific year (1996) and a specific recipient from among four accomplished scientists. This is a very specific factual question that requires precise knowledge of award history.

Let me consider what I know:
- All four options are distinguished scientists in their fields
- Susan Lindquist was known for work on protein folding and heat shock proteins
- Elizabeth Blackburn won the Nobel Prize for telomere research
- Patricia Goldman-Rakic was a neuroscientist
- Philippa Marrack is an immunologist

However, I don't have confident, specific knowledge about who received the Dickson Prize in Medicine specifically in 1996. This is a very precise historical fact, and getting it wrong would cost me a point. The risk of guessing incorrectly outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Which day, month, and year was the second episode of Season 2 of What We Do in the Shadows originally aired?
----------
  A: May 6, 2020
  B: April 8, 2020
  C: April 22, 2020
  D: April 15, 2020
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about a specific TV show episode air date.

This is asking for the exact air date of the second episode of Season 2 of "What We Do in the Shadows." This is a very specific factual question that requires precise knowledge of TV scheduling from 2020.

While I have some general knowledge about the show, pinpointing the exact air date of a specific episode (not a premiere, but the second episode of a season) is quite difficult. The options are all in April-May 2020, which seems plausible for a Season 2 timeframe, but I don't have high confidence in distinguishing between these specific dates.

Given that:
- This requires very specific factual recall
- The penalty for being wrong (-1) equals the reward for being right (+1)
- I don't have strong confidence in knowing this particular detail
- The risk-reward ratio suggests I should only answer when reasonably confident

I should PASS on this question.

Question:
Who was the father of the Russian stage actress and singer "Baroness Olga Vadimovna von Root?"
----------
  A: Baron Nikolai Petrovich von Root
  B: Baron Aleksandr Mikhailovich von Root
  C: Baron Vadim Nikolayevich von Root
  D: Baron Sergei Ivanovich von Root
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Baroness Olga Vadimovna von Root's father.

This is a very specific historical question about a Russian stage actress and singer. The patronymic "Vadimovna" indicates her father's first name was Vadim, which is a strong clue. In Russian naming conventions, the patronymic is derived directly from the father's first name.

Looking at the options:
- A: Baron Nikolai Petrovich von Root
- B: Baron Aleksandr Mikhailovich von Root
- C: Baron Vadim Nikolayevich von Root (has "Vadim" as the first name)
- D: Baron Sergei Ivanovich von Root

Option C contains "Vadim" which matches the patronymic "Vadimovna" (meaning "daughter of Vadim").

However, I should consider:
1. I'm not certain this person actually existed or if this is accurate historical information
2. While the patronymic logic is sound, I don't have specific knowledge of this particular historical figure
3. This could be a trick question or test of obscure knowledge

Given that the patronymic provides a strong linguistic clue and the logic is straightforward, I have reasonable confidence, but this is still quite obscure historical knowledge that I cannot verify with certainty.

The risk-reward suggests I should answer given the strong patronymic clue, but my lack of specific knowledge about this person makes me hesitant.

Question:
In whose honor was the Leipzig 1877 tournament organized?
----------
  A: Howard Staunton
  B: Wilhelm Steinitz
  C: Paul Morphy
  D: Adolf Anderssen
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about chess history.

The Leipzig 1877 tournament is a specific historical chess event. Let me think about what I know:

- Adolf Anderssen was a prominent German chess master who died in 1879
- Leipzig is a German city
- Memorial tournaments were common in chess history to honor deceased masters
- The timing (1877) would be appropriate for a memorial tournament for Anderssen if he had recently died, but he actually died in 1879, so this doesn't fit
- However, tournaments could also be organized to honor living masters

I'm not certain about this specific tournament. While I have some knowledge of chess history, the specific details of the Leipzig 1877 tournament and who it honored are not something I'm confident about. Given that:
- This is a very specific historical question
- I could lose a point if wrong
- I'm not highly confident in any particular answer

The prudent choice is to pass.

  D: Seth Milchick
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this question regarding the TV show "Severance."

This is asking about a specific character role in Season 1 of Severance. The head of security on the severed floor is a notable character in the show. Let me think through what I know:

- Seth Milchick is a manager/supervisor character
- Mark Graner - I'm not certain about this character
- The other names I'm less familiar with in this context

I have some knowledge about Severance, but I'm not highly confident about the specific title and role of "head of security" versus other management positions on the severed floor. This is a very specific detail that requires precise knowledge of the show's character roles.

Given that:
1. This is a specific factual question about a TV show
2. I'm not highly confident in distinguishing between the exact roles of these characters
3. Getting it wrong costs me a point
4. The risk/reward doesn't favor guessing when uncertain

I should PASS on this question.

------------------------------

  1: Answer

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the location of a radio transmitter and nearby interstate.

This question asks about:
- KTCZ-FM transmitter location
- KMSP Tower
- Ramby Avenue
- Which interstate is nearby

This is a very specific factual question about local geography in what appears to be the Minneapolis-St. Paul area (given the "MSP" in KMSP Tower and the Minnesota interstate numbers). Without specific knowledge of:
1. Where exactly Ramby Avenue is located
2. Where the KMSP Tower stands
3. The precise location of the KTCZ-FM transmitter

I would essentially be guessing among four plausible Minnesota interstates. This is highly specialized local knowledge that I'm not confident I have accurately.

The risk of losing a point by guessing incorrectly outweighs the potential gain, especially since I have no strong basis for selecting one answer over the others.

This is a very specific historical/political fact about which county refused to lower flags to half-staff after the Pulse nightclub shooting. This would have been a notable and controversial decision that likely received media attention at the time.

However, I don't have strong confidence in my knowledge of this specific detail. This is the kind of obscure factual question where:
1. It requires knowing a specific news event from 2016
2. It's about a single county's decision among thousands of U.S. counties
3. Getting it wrong would cost me a point

Without high confidence in knowing which specific county took this action, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about the Mathematical Association of America David P. Robbins Prize winner in 2008.

This is a very specific factual question about a particular mathematical prize in a specific year. The David P. Robbins Prize is awarded by the MAA for papers in algebra, combinatorics, or discrete mathematics. While I have some general knowledge about mathematical prizes and the mathematicians listed (all are prominent in combinatorics), I don't have reliable specific knowledge about who won this particular prize in 2008.

All four options are distinguished mathematicians in combinatorics:
- Doron Zeilberger is known for algorithmic proof theory
- Richard Stanley is famous for enumerative combinatorics
- Neil Sloane created the OEIS
- Herbert Wilf worked in combinatorics and algorithms

Without confident knowledge of the specific 2008 winner, attempting to answer would be essentially guessing, giving me roughly a 25% chance of being correct. The expected value of guessing would be: 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = -0.5 points.

This is negative expected value, so I should pass.

John B. Goodenough is a renowned scientist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2019 for his work on lithium-ion batteries. However, the question asks specifically about the Welch Award in Chemistry, which is a different award.

I don't have reliable, specific knowledge about the exact year he received the Welch Award in Chemistry. While I know he received numerous awards throughout his career, I cannot confidently pinpoint which year among the options (2015, 2017, 2019, or 2021) is correct for this specific award.

Given the risk of losing a point if I'm wrong versus gaining nothing by passing, and considering my uncertainty about this specific fact, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
Who was the commencement speaker at Harvard in 2018?
----------
  A: John Lewis
  B: Michael Bloomberg
  C: Tim Cook
  D: Kamala Harris
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about who spoke at Harvard's 2018 commencement.

Let me think about what I know:
- Harvard commencement speakers are typically prominent figures
- 2018 is recent enough that I should have reliable information
- The options include John Lewis (civil rights leader), Michael Bloomberg (former NYC mayor), Tim Cook (Apple CEO), and Kamala Harris (then Senator/CA AG)

I recall that Mark Zuckerberg spoke at Harvard in 2017. For 2018, I believe it was John Lewis, the civil rights icon and congressman, who gave the commencement address at Harvard.

However, I'm not entirely certain about this. There's a possibility I could be confusing years or institutions. Given that:
- Wrong answer = -1 point
- Pass = 0 points
- Correct answer = +1 point

The expected value depends on my confidence. I'd estimate I'm about 60-65% confident, which means the expected value is slightly positive but not strongly so.

Given the moderate uncertainty and the symmetric payoff structure, this is a borderline case. I'll choose to answer since I have a reasonable degree of confidence.

Question:
How many girls are in "Girls on the Bridge," Munch's painting from 1900 (in the version where some of them are looking at the river)?
----------
  A: Five
  B: Three
  C: Two
  D: Four
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this specific art history question.

This question asks about a specific version of Edvard Munch's "Girls on the Bridge" from 1900, with the detail that some girls are looking at the river. Munch created multiple versions of this painting with variations in the number of figures.

While I have general knowledge about Munch's work, I'm not certain about the exact number of girls in this specific 1900 version with the particular detail mentioned. This is a very specific factual question about a particular artwork, and getting details like the exact number of figures wrong is easy to do without direct visual reference.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the reward for correct answers (+1 point), and my uncertainty about this specific detail, the risk doesn't seem worth it.

Question:
Who was the commencement speaker at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1994?
----------
  A: Her Majesty Queen Noor of Jordan
  B: His Royal Highness Prince Charles of Wales
  C: His Highness Karim Aga Khan IV
  D: His Excellency Nelson Mandela

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about MIT's 1994 commencement speaker.

This is a very specific historical fact - the commencement speaker at a particular university in a particular year. While all four options are notable world figures who could plausibly have been commencement speakers at MIT in 1994, I don't have reliable knowledge of this specific event.

1994 was a significant year (Nelson Mandela became President of South Africa, for instance), but without concrete knowledge of MIT's commencement records, I would essentially be guessing among these options.

Given that:
- This requires specific factual knowledge I'm uncertain about
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- The risk/reward doesn't favor guessing when uncertain

------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Two Oceans Marathon in Cape Town.

This is a very specific historical question requiring exact knowledge of:
- The day (specific date)
- The month
- The year
- Of the first race of this particular marathon

I don't have reliable, certain knowledge of when the first Two Oceans Marathon took place. This is a factual question with a precise answer, and guessing among four options gives me only a 25% chance of being correct if I don't know the answer. The risk-reward calculation suggests:
- If I guess and am wrong: -1 point (75% probability)
- If I guess and am right: +1 point (25% probability)
- Expected value of guessing: 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = -0.5 points

Since I'm not confident about this specific historical fact and the expected value of guessing is negative, I should pass.

----------
  A: Harrison

------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Sir George Stokes Award winner in 2001.

The Sir George Stokes Award is given by the Institute of Physics for contributions to physics. This is a very specific factual question requiring knowledge of a particular award recipient from over 20 years ago. 

I don't have reliable knowledge of who won this specific award in 2001. This is the type of detailed historical fact that I could easily get wrong, and guessing among four options gives me only a 25% chance of being correct if I guess randomly.

Given that:
- Wrong answer = -1 point
- Pass = 0 points
- Right answer = +1 point
- My confidence is very low

The expected value of guessing would be negative, so the rational choice is to pass.

While I have some general knowledge about this game, the exact number of CDs in the original soundtrack release is a highly specific detail that I'm not confident about.

This type of question requires precise knowledge of a particular product release, and getting it wrong would cost me a point. Given my uncertainty about this specific detail, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
In a 1988 paper, which author defined Mammalia phylogenetically as the crown group of mammals—the clade consisting of the most recent common ancestor of living monotremes and therian mammals?
----------
  A: George Gaylord Simpson
  B: Timothy Rowe

------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the phylogenetic definition of Mammalia from a 1988 paper.

This is a very specific historical question about mammalian systematics. It asks about:
- A 1988 paper
- The author who defined Mammalia phylogenetically as a crown group
- Specifically referring to the most recent common ancestor of monotremes and therians

This is highly specialized knowledge in vertebrate paleontology and systematics. While I have some knowledge that Timothy Rowe was influential in phylogenetic definitions of Mammalia and crown group concepts, I'm not certain about the specific 1988 paper or whether it was definitively him versus the other prominent mammalian systematists listed (Simpson, Novacek, or McKenna).

Given:
- This is extremely specific (year, author, definition)
- Multiple plausible experts are listed
- I'm not highly confident in distinguishing the correct answer
- The penalty for wrong answers equals the reward for correct answers
- I should only answer when reasonably confident

This is a case where uncertainty is high enough that the expected value of answering is likely negative or neutral at best.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the 2016 IGN awards and the TV series Hannibal.

3. Which award Hannibal did NOT win (requiring knowledge of what it did win)

This requires detailed knowledge of entertainment industry awards from a specific year. Hannibal was a critically acclaimed series that ended in 2015, so 2016 awards could have been retrospective or final-season awards. However, I don't have reliable specific information about which IGN awards Hannibal won or didn't win in 2016.

This is a factual question with a definitive answer, but I lack confidence in my knowledge of this specific detail. Getting it wrong would cost me a point, while passing costs me nothing.

What city was Richard Serra in when he created his work "To Lift"?

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this question regarding Richard Serra's work "To Lift."

Richard Serra is a famous sculptor known for his large-scale steel sculptures. "To Lift" is one of his early works from around 1967. This was part of his "Verb List" series where he explored actions like rolling, propping, and lifting with lead and other materials.

I believe "To Lift" was created in New York, where Serra was based in the late 1960s and was part of the downtown art scene. However, I'm not entirely certain about the specific location where this particular work was created - it could have been in his studio or during a specific exhibition.

Given that this is a very specific factual question about art history and I have some uncertainty about the exact city, even though New York seems most likely, I should be cautious.

My confidence level: Moderate, but not high enough to risk losing a point.

----------
  A: 2003
  B: 2005

------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Virgil K. Smith's driver's license revocation.

This is a very specific factual question about:
- A Michigan politician named Virgil K. Smith
- Two DUI/OWI charges in 2004 (February and August)
- When his driver's license was actually revoked

The question asks when the license was revoked, not when the offenses occurred. License revocations typically happen after legal proceedings, which could mean the revocation occurred in 2004 (same year) or 2005 (following year after court proceedings).

However, I don't have reliable specific knowledge about:
- This particular politician's case details
- The exact timeline of his license revocation
- Michigan's specific administrative procedures for license revocation in 2004

This is an obscure factual detail about a specific person's legal history. Without access to reliable information about this case, I would essentially be guessing among the options.

Given the low confidence and high specificity of this question, the strategic choice is to PASS.

Let me think about what I know:
- The Salem Prize is awarded to young mathematicians for outstanding contributions
- Akshay Venkatesh is a prominent mathematician who received the Fields Medal
- I would need to know the specific year Venkatesh received the Salem Prize and then identify the next two recipients

The problem is that I'm not certain about:
1. The exact year Venkatesh received the Salem Prize
2. The complete chronological list of Salem Prize winners
3. Whether the "two scientists after" means the immediate next recipient(s) or two separate years

This is a very specific factual question about a particular award's history. While I have some knowledge about these mathematicians, I'm not confident enough in the precise chronological ordering of Salem Prize recipients to risk losing a point.

Given the penalty for wrong answers and my uncertainty about this specific factual information, the strategic choice is to pass.

Which architect built the Palace of Running Water in Buenos Aires?

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Palace of Running Water (Palacio de Aguas Corrientes) in Buenos Aires.

Let me consider what I know:
- The Palacio de Aguas Corrientes is a famous building in Buenos Aires that housed water tanks
- It's known for its ornate facade with terracotta and glazed tiles
- It was built in the late 19th century

Looking at the architects listed:
- Alejandro Bustillo was a prominent Argentine architect but worked mainly in the 20th century
- Francisco Tamburini was involved in major Buenos Aires projects like Teatro Colón
- Carlos Nyströmer - I'm less certain about this name
- Eduardo Le Monnier - also less familiar

I have some general knowledge about this building, but I'm not highly confident about which specific architect from this list designed it. The building was completed around 1894, and I believe it involved Swedish-Argentine engineers, which might connect to the name "Nyströmer."

However, my confidence level is moderate at best - probably around 40-50%. Given that:
- Wrong answer = -1 point
- Pass = 0 points
- Right answer = +1 point

With less than 50% confidence, the expected value of answering is negative, so passing is the better strategic choice.

- Marcel Minnaert (Dutch astronomer)
- Victor Ambartsumian (Armenian astrophysicist)
- André Lallemand (French astronomer)
- Bengt Strömgren (Danish astronomer)

All four were prominent astronomers of that era, which makes this a challenging question. Without strong confidence in the specific year and recipient, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
For how many years did John Constable (English landscape painter) work on "The Opening of Waterloo Bridge"?
----------
  A: 11
  B: 18
  C: 13
  D: 7
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about John Constable's work on "The Opening of Waterloo Bridge."

This is a very specific historical fact about art history. While I know John Constable was a famous English landscape painter, the exact number of years he worked on this particular painting is a precise detail that I'm not certain about. This isn't general knowledge that I can reason through - it requires knowing the specific historical record.

Given that:
- This is a highly specific factual question
- I don't have strong confidence in any particular answer
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- Passing costs me nothing

The risk-reward calculation suggests I should pass on this question.

Question:
Which Google Sheets function is specifically designed to convert a Unix epoch timestamp to a regular datetime in the UTC timezone?
----------
  A: EPOCHTODATE
  B: EPOCHTOUTC
  C: TIMESTAMPTODATE
  D: UNIXTODATETIME
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this Google Sheets question about Unix epoch timestamp conversion.

Let me think about what I know:
- Unix epoch timestamps are seconds since January 1, 1970
- Google Sheets has various date/time functions
- The question asks for a function "specifically designed" for this purpose

Looking at the options:
- EPOCHTODATE - sounds plausible but I'm not certain this exists
- EPOCHTOUTC - also sounds plausible with the UTC specification
- TIMESTAMPTODATE - could be real but less specific to Unix epoch
- UNIXTODATETIME - also sounds plausible

The truth is, I'm not highly confident about which of these is the actual Google Sheets function. In fact, I believe the standard way to convert Unix timestamps in Google Sheets is typically using a formula like `=A1/86400 + DATE(1970,1,1)` rather than a dedicated function. I'm not certain any of these specific function names are real Google Sheets functions.

Given my uncertainty and the risk of losing a point if wrong, I should pass on this question.

What was the first and last name of the Swiss painter who murdered his landlady, Anne King?
----------
  A: François Lemoyne
  B: Théodore Gardelle
  C: Jean-Baptiste Greuze
  D: Antoine Watteau
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a Swiss painter who murdered his landlady Anne King.

Let me consider what I know:
- This is a very specific historical question about a criminal case
- The victim's name is given as Anne King
- I'm looking for a Swiss painter
- The options include French-sounding names

Théodore Gardelle was indeed a Swiss painter who was executed in 1761 for murdering his landlady, Anne King, in London. This is a documented historical case.

The other options:
- François Lemoyne was a French painter (died 1737)
- Jean-Baptiste Greuze was a French painter
- Antoine Watteau was a French painter (died 1721)

I have reasonable confidence that the answer is B: Théodore Gardelle, as this matches the specific historical case described.

Question:
In which Community episode is Evil Abed's first appearance? Please give the season, episode number, and title.
----------
  A: Season 2 Episode 14 "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons"
  B: Season 3 Episode 4 "Remedial Chaos Theory"
  C: Season 4 Episode 11 "Basic Human Anatomy"
  D: Season 3 Episode 22 "Introduction to Finality"
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this specific question regarding the TV show "Community" and Evil Abed's first appearance.

Evil Abed is a memorable character from Community. Let me think about what I know:
- Evil Abed appears in the "darkest timeline" concept
- "Remedial Chaos Theory" (Season 3, Episode 4) is the famous episode with multiple timelines where the darkest timeline is created
- This is where Evil Abed with the felt goatee first appears in the tag scene

However, I should be cautious because:
- TV show episode details can be tricky
- "First appearance" could be interpreted different ways
- I might be confusing when the character was introduced vs. when they appeared more prominently

Looking at the options, "Remedial Chaos Theory" is option B, which aligns with my recollection. But "Introduction to Finality" (option D) is a season finale that also deals with the darkest timeline, so Evil Abed could appear there too.

My confidence is moderate but not absolute. Given that getting it wrong costs a point and passing costs nothing, I should consider the risk. However, I do have fairly strong knowledge that "Remedial Chaos Theory" is where the darkest timeline and Evil Abed originated.

I'll answer this question.

What is the surname of the individual who won the Robert Boyle Prize for Analytical Science, formerly called the Boyle Medal, in 2012?
----------
  A: Ramsey

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Robert Boyle Prize for Analytical Science winner in 2012.

This is a very specific factual question about a particular award winner in a specific year. The Robert Boyle Prize for Analytical Science is a specialized award in analytical chemistry. Without access to specific records or databases about this award's recipients, I would essentially be guessing among the four options provided.

While I might have some general knowledge about prominent analytical scientists, pinpointing the exact winner of this specific prize in 2012 requires precise factual knowledge that I'm not confident I possess. The risk of losing a point by guessing incorrectly outweighs the potential gain.

What is the surname of the person who first discovered the blood-sucking bug Triatoma carrioni?
----------
  A: Blanchard
  B: Neiva
  C: Larrousse
  D: Dujardin

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the discoverer of *Triatoma carrioni*, a blood-sucking bug (triatomine).

This is a very specific entomological/parasitological question about who first described this particular species of kissing bug. *Triatoma* species are vectors for Chagas disease, and many species were described by various researchers in the early-to-mid 20th century.

The name "carrioni" suggests it might be named after someone named Carrión (possibly Daniel Alcides Carrión, a Peruvian medical student). However, the question asks who discovered/described it, not who it was named after.

Looking at the options:
- Blanchard, Neiva, Larrousse, and Dujardin are all names associated with parasitology and entomology from that era
- Without specific knowledge of which researcher described this particular species, I would be guessing

This is highly specialized taxonomic knowledge that I'm not confident about. The risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level in answering this question about who discovered a minor planet named after Viktor Vasnetsov.

This is a very specific question about:
1. Viktor Vasnetsov (a Russian artist)
2. A minor planet named after him
3. Who discovered that specific minor planet

This requires knowing:
- That there is a minor planet named after Vasnetsov
- The specific discoverer from among four Soviet/Russian astronomers

All four options are real Soviet astronomers who discovered minor planets, but I would need to know the specific discovery record for the minor planet named after Vasnetsov. This is extremely specialized astronomical knowledge that I'm not confident about.

Given:
- The highly specific nature of this question
- The need for precise astronomical discovery records
- My uncertainty about which of these astronomers discovered this particular minor planet
- The penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points)

I should PASS on this question.

In what year did Pope Francis decline to be appointed President of the Argentine Bishops’ Conference?
----------
  A: 2002

------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Pope Francis and the Argentine Bishops' Conference.

What I know:
- Pope Francis (Jorge Mario Bergoglio) was Archbishop of Buenos Aires before becoming Pope
- He was involved in Argentine church leadership in the early 2000s
- This is a very specific historical detail about him declining an appointment

However, this is an extremely specific fact that requires precise knowledge of Pope Francis's career timeline in Argentina. I don't have strong confidence in any particular year among these options. This is the type of detailed biographical information that I could easily get wrong, and the penalty for a wrong answer (-1 point) equals the reward for a correct answer (+1 point).

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact year, the expected value of answering is likely negative or neutral at best.

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Haddo House and its art collection.

This is a very specific question about:
- Haddo House (a specific building designed by William Adam)
- A collection of 85 paintings by a particular artist
- Four Scottish artists as options

This requires specialized knowledge about:
1. Scottish architecture and historic houses
2. The specific art collection at Haddo House
3. Scottish artists from the relevant period

I don't have confident knowledge about the specific contents of Haddo House's art collection. While I recognize these are all Scottish artists from roughly the 18th-19th centuries, knowing which specific artist has 85 paintings at this particular house is very specialized information. This is not general knowledge but rather detailed information about a specific collection.

Given:
- The highly specific nature of the question
- My lack of confident knowledge about Haddo House's collection
- The risk of losing a point if wrong
- The safe option of passing for 0 points

The prudent choice is to pass.

Question:
Which foreign merchant was issued the right to transact slaves on Spain's behalf and ordered regulations on trade with Cuba?
----------
  A: Casa de Contratación
  B: Asiento de Negros
  C: Consejo de Indias
  D: Real Compañía de Comercio
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to analyze this question about Spanish colonial trade and slavery regulations.

The question asks about a foreign merchant given rights to transact slaves on Spain's behalf and who ordered regulations on trade with Cuba.

Let me consider each option:

A: Casa de Contratación - This was a Spanish government agency that controlled trade with the Americas, not a foreign merchant.

B: Asiento de Negros - This was a contract/license system that granted (often to foreign merchants/companies) the right to supply enslaved Africans to Spanish colonies. This fits "foreign merchant" and "right to transact slaves."

C: Consejo de Indias - This was the Council of the Indies, a Spanish governmental body, not a foreign merchant.

D: Real Compañía de Comercio - This was a Spanish royal trading company, not foreign.

The key phrase is "foreign merchant" - the Asiento de Negros system specifically involved granting monopoly rights to foreign entities (British, French, Dutch companies at various times) to conduct the slave trade with Spanish colonies.

However, I'm slightly uncertain about the specific connection to "ordered regulations on trade with Cuba" - that sounds more governmental. But given the options and the emphasis on "foreign merchant" with slave trading rights, B seems most likely.

I'm reasonably confident but not certain.

  1: Answer

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the designer of the Emil J. Oberhoffer House in Lakeville, Minnesota.

This is a very specific architectural history question about a particular historic house. I don't have reliable knowledge about who designed this specific house. The question asks for a definite factual answer with four Scandinavian names as options, which suggests the designer had Scandinavian heritage (fitting for Minnesota's demographics).

Without confident knowledge of this specific architectural detail, attempting to answer would essentially be guessing among four options, giving me only a 25% chance of being correct if I guess randomly. The expected value of guessing would be: (0.25 × 1) + (0.75 × -1) = -0.5 points.

Since I'm not confident about this answer and the expected value of guessing is negative, I should pass.

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Louis Armstrong's first teacher and who chose him as bandleader.

Let me consider what I know:
- Louis Armstrong's early musical education in New Orleans is well-documented
- Peter Davis was an instructor at the Colored Waif's Home for Boys where young Louis was sent
- Peter Davis taught Armstrong to play the cornet and made him the leader of the home's band
- Joe "King" Oliver was Armstrong's mentor later and got him jobs, but wasn't his first teacher
- Bunk Johnson and Buddy Bolden were earlier New Orleans jazz pioneers

The question asks specifically about his "first teacher" who also "chose him as the bandleader." This points strongly to Peter Davis at the Colored Waif's Home, where Armstrong received his first formal musical instruction and was made band leader.

I'm quite confident the answer is B: Peter Davis.

- F.W. de Klerk served 1989-1994 and died in 2021
- Constand Viljoen was a military figure and politician but not a president
- P.W. Botha was president from 1984-1989

I believe P.W. Botha died on October 31, 2006, not January 4, 2007. However, I'm not entirely certain about the exact date.

Wait - could this be asking for the full name? The question asks for "name and surname" but only gives surnames as options. This seems odd.

Given the uncertainty about the exact death date and some confusion about what the question is asking for (it wants "name and surname" but only provides surnames), I have moderate but not high confidence in this answer.

However, Botha (D) seems most likely to be correct as he's the only one who died around that timeframe.

I'll answer, as I have reasonable confidence.

Question:
Who was awarded the John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science in 1994?
----------
  A: Marina Ratner
  B: Karen Uhlenbeck
  C: Joan Birman
  D: Dusa McDuff
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about who received the John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of Science in 1994.

The John J. Carty Award is a prestigious award given by the National Academy of Sciences. Looking at the options, all four are distinguished female mathematicians:
- Marina Ratner - known for work in ergodic theory
- Karen Uhlenbeck - known for geometric analysis
- Joan Birman - known for knot theory and braid theory
- Dusa McDuff - known for symplectic geometry

This is a very specific factual question about a particular year's award recipient. While I have some knowledge about these mathematicians and their achievements, I'm not confident about the specific year 1994 for this particular award. This is the type of detailed historical fact where I could easily be wrong, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given the specificity of the question and my uncertainty about the exact year and recipient, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What is the name of the Japanese scientist who received the Shaw Prize in 2008?
----------
  A: Takaaki Kajita
  B: Shinya Yamanaka
  C: Makoto Kobayashi
  D: Satoshi Ōmura
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Shaw Prize in 2008.

The Shaw Prize is awarded in three categories: Astronomy, Life Science and Medicine, and Mathematical Sciences. In 2008, there were multiple laureates across these categories.

Let me consider what I know about each option:
- Takaaki Kajita: Known for neutrino physics, won Nobel Prize in 2015
- Shinya Yamanaka: Known for induced pluripotent stem cells, won Nobel Prize in 2012
- Makoto Kobayashi: Particle physicist, won Nobel Prize in 2008
- Satoshi Ōmura: Microbiologist, won Nobel Prize in 2015

I'm not certain about the specific Shaw Prize winners in 2008. While I have some knowledge about these scientists' achievements, I cannot confidently identify which one received the Shaw Prize specifically in 2008. The Shaw Prize is distinct from the Nobel Prize, and I'm not sufficiently confident in my knowledge of the 2008 Shaw Prize recipients to risk losing a point.

Given the uncertainty and the penalty for wrong answers, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What year did Doris Salcedo get the Rolf Schock Prize in Visual Arts for the first time?
----------
  A: 2015
  B: 2019
  C: 2013
  D: 2017
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about when Doris Salcedo received the Rolf Schock Prize in Visual Arts.

Doris Salcedo is a Colombian artist known for her sculpture and installation work. The Rolf Schock Prizes are prestigious awards given in several categories including Visual Arts. However, I'm not certain about the specific year she received this prize. The question asks for "the first time," which suggests she may have received it once (or the phrasing is just being careful).

Looking at the options: 2015, 2019, 2013, or 2017. These are all relatively recent years, which makes sense for a contemporary artist. However, I don't have strong confidence in any particular year. This is a very specific factual question about an award date, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given my uncertainty about this specific fact, the strategic choice is to pass rather than risk losing a point.

Question:
In 1999, who presented Susan Lucci with an Emmy?

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Susan Lucci's Emmy presentation in 1999.

Susan Lucci was famous for being nominated for a Daytime Emmy many times (19 times) before finally winning in 1999 for her role in "All My Children." This was a significant pop culture moment. I recall that Shemar Moore, who was her co-star on "All My Children," presented her with the award, which made it particularly meaningful.

I'm reasonably confident about this answer being D: Shemar Moore, as this detail was widely reported due to the emotional significance of the moment.

Question:
Which religion is the third largest among Singaporean residents based on the 2020 census?
----------
  A: Buddhism
  B: Hinduism
  C: Islam
  D: Christianity
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about Singapore's religious demographics from the 2020 census.

What I know:
- Singapore is a multi-religious society
- Buddhism and Christianity are major religions there
- There's a significant Muslim population
- There's also a Hindu population, primarily among the Indian community

The question asks for the THIRD largest religion. My understanding is that:
1. Buddhism is typically the largest
2. Christianity is usually second or Islam might be second
3. The third would likely be either Islam or Christianity

However, I'm not certain about the exact ranking from the 2020 census specifically. The order between Christianity and Islam for second and third place is what I'm uncertain about. Without being confident in the precise census data, this could easily be wrong.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my uncertainty about whether the third largest is Islam or Christianity, I should pass on this question.

Question:
What year is 2024 in the Discordian calendar?
----------
  A: 3188 YOLD
  B: 3185 YOLD
  C: 3190 YOLD
  D: 3192 YOLD
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about the Discordian calendar.

The Discordian calendar is from Discordianism, a parody religion. It uses "Year of Our Lady of Discord" (YOLD) and adds 1166 to the Gregorian calendar year.

So 2024 + 1166 = 3190 YOLD

This would make the answer C: 3190 YOLD.

However, I should consider:
- This is a very niche topic
- I'm fairly confident in the +1166 conversion rule
- The math is straightforward: 2024 + 1166 = 3190
- Option C matches my calculation

I have reasonable confidence in this answer based on my knowledge of the Discordian calendar conversion.

This is a very specific question about a South American honor/decoration. The Order of the Liberator General San Martín is an Argentine order of merit. However, I don't have reliable knowledge about which specific sculptor designed this order, and the names provided all appear to be Spanish/Latin American names that could plausibly be correct.

Without confident knowledge of the correct answer, and given that guessing wrong would cost me a point while passing costs nothing, the strategic choice is clear.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this question regarding Robbie Robertson's early musical career.

Robbie Robertson is famously known for his work with The Band, but this question asks about his first band from 1956. At that time, Robertson would have been quite young (born in 1943, so he'd be around 13 in 1956).

I have some knowledge that Robertson joined Ronnie Hawkins's backing band called The Hawks later in his career, but I'm not certain about which specific band he joined in 1956 when he was just starting out as a teenager. The options include various band names from that era, but I don't have strong confidence in distinguishing which one was specifically his first band in 1956.

Given that:
- This is a very specific historical detail about a particular year
- I'm not highly confident in my knowledge of Robertson's earliest teenage bands
- Getting it wrong would cost me a point
- The risk/reward doesn't favor guessing

3. The complete name of that specific institution

This is an obscure biographical detail about a Pakistani political figure from the early post-independence period. I don't have reliable knowledge about where Ashraf Abbasi specifically studied.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the architect of the Palace of Justice of the Argentine Nation.

This is a very specific question about Argentine architectural history. The Palace of Justice (Palacio de Justicia) is located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

Looking at the options:
- Norbert Maillart - French architect
- Eduardo Le Monnier - This name sounds familiar in Argentine architecture context
- René Sergent - French architect
- Alejandro Christophersen - Norwegian-Argentine architect who worked extensively in Argentina

I have some uncertainty here. While I believe Alejandro Christophersen was involved in many important Argentine buildings, I'm not entirely certain about this specific building. The Palace of Justice is a significant building, and I recall it being designed by a French architect, which could point to Maillart or Sergent, but I'm not confident enough to distinguish between them with certainty.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my lack of strong confidence in the correct answer, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What is the chemical name of the drug previously known to treat bacterial infections that Dr. William Schwartz discovered also acts as a diuretic in people with congestive heart failure?
----------
  A: Sulfanilamide.
  B: Penicillin
  C: Streptomycin
  D: Chloramphenicol
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about medical history.

This question asks about a specific historical discovery by Dr. William Schwartz regarding a bacterial infection treatment that was found to have diuretic properties for congestive heart failure patients.

Let me think through what I know:
- This sounds like it's referring to the discovery of sulfonamide antibiotics and their diuretic effects
- Sulfanilamide was indeed one of the early sulfa drugs used to treat bacterial infections
- The discovery that certain sulfonamides had diuretic properties led to the development of modern diuretic medications
- This is a very specific historical medical question requiring knowledge of a particular researcher's work

However, I'm not entirely certain about:
- Whether Dr. William Schwartz was specifically the person who made this discovery
- Whether sulfanilamide was the exact drug in question (vs. other sulfonamides)

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact historical details, particularly regarding Dr. Schwartz's specific contribution, this is a risky question to answer. While sulfanilamide seems like the most plausible answer among the options, I'm not confident enough to risk losing a point.

Question:
Which scientist was awarded the Gregori Aminoff Prize in 1996?
----------
  A: Philip Coppens
  B: Wayne Hendrickson
  C: Michael Rossmann
  D: Ada Yonath
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about the Gregori Aminoff Prize winner in 1996.

The Gregori Aminoff Prize is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for contributions in crystallography. While I have some knowledge about this prize and the scientists listed (all are notable crystallographers), I'm not certain about the specific year 1996.

- Philip Coppens: Known for charge density studies
- Wayne Hendrickson: Known for MAD phasing and protein crystallography
- Michael Rossmann: Known for molecular replacement and virus structures
- Ada Yonath: Won Nobel Prize in 2009 for ribosome structure

Without being confident about the specific 1996 winner, and given that an incorrect answer costs me a point while passing costs nothing, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
In what year did Kristin Otto retire from swimming?
----------
  A: 1990
  B: 1989
  C: 1987
  D: 1991
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in knowing when Kristin Otto retired from swimming.

Kristin Otto was an East German swimmer who was very successful in the 1980s, particularly at the 1988 Seoul Olympics where she won six gold medals. However, I'm not certain about her exact retirement year. The options range from 1987 to 1991, which span the period around the 1988 Olympics.

Given that:
- She competed at the 1988 Olympics
- 1987 would be before the Olympics (unlikely if that was her peak)
- The other options are 1989, 1990, or 1991

I have some general knowledge but I'm not confident enough about the specific year to risk losing a point. This is a very specific factual question about a retirement date, and I could easily be wrong.

Question:
What castle overlooked Carmel Glen and its burn and was situated in Knockentiber, East Ayrshire?
----------
  A: Busbie Castle
  B: Glencairn Castle
  C: Knockentiber Castle
  D: Carmel Castle
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a castle in Knockentiber, East Ayrshire that overlooked Carmel Glen.

This is a very specific historical and geographical question about Scottish castles. The question asks about a castle that:
1. Overlooked Carmel Glen and its burn (stream)
2. Was situated in Knockentiber, East Ayrshire

Looking at the options:
- Busbie Castle - I'm not familiar with this being in Knockentiber
- Glencairn Castle - This sounds like it could be related to a glen
- Knockentiber Castle - This has "Knockentiber" in the name, which matches the location
- Carmel Castle - This has "Carmel" in the name, matching Carmel Glen

This is highly specialized local Scottish history. While option C (Knockentiber Castle) seems like an obvious match due to the location name, and option D (Carmel Castle) matches the glen name, I don't have reliable knowledge about which castle actually overlooked Carmel Glen in this specific area.

Given that this requires specific historical knowledge about East Ayrshire castles that I'm not confident I possess, the risk of losing a point is high.

------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Indian music history.

This question asks about a specific historical event - the first Indian musician to perform at the UN General Assembly in 1966. This is a very specific factual question.

Let me consider what I know:
- M.S. Subbulakshmi (option A) was a legendary Carnatic vocalist who was highly acclaimed and received many honors
- She was known for performing at prestigious international venues
- I have some recollection that she performed at the UN, and this would align with her prominence in the 1960s

However, this is a very specific historical fact (the year 1966 and "first Indian musician"), and I could be confusing different events or misremembering details. The other musicians listed are also accomplished, though I'm less familiar with their international performances.

Given that:
1. This requires precise historical knowledge
2. I have some confidence about M.S. Subbulakshmi but I'm not certain about the specific year or whether she was definitively the "first"
3. Getting this wrong would cost me a point

My confidence level is moderate but not high enough to justify the risk of losing a point.

Question:
Who did Richard Neutra design the Elkay Apartments for?

  D: John Entenza
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this architectural history question.

Richard Neutra was a prominent modernist architect. The question asks about the Elkay Apartments specifically. Let me think about what I know:

- Edgar Kaufmann is famous for commissioning Fallingwater by Frank Lloyd Wright
- Philip Lovell commissioned the Lovell Health House from Neutra (this is one of Neutra's most famous works)
- John Entenza was involved with the Case Study Houses program
- Louis Kievman - I'm less certain about this connection

The Elkay Apartments is not one of Neutra's most famous works that I'm highly confident about. While I have some knowledge of Neutra's major projects, I'm not sufficiently certain about this specific commission to risk losing a point.

Given the goal is to maximize points and I should only answer when confident, the prudent choice here is to pass.

Question:
Which school did Lyndon B. Johnson briefly teach in Pearsall?
----------
  A: Pearsall Middle School
  B: Cotulla Elementary School
  C: Welhausen Elementary School
  D: Pearsall High School
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about Lyndon B. Johnson's teaching career.

What I know:
- LBJ did teach early in his career in Texas
- He famously taught at a school with Mexican-American students, which was a formative experience
- I recall he taught in Cotulla, Texas at Welhausen Elementary School
- The question asks about Pearsall, which is a different location

The question specifically asks about Pearsall, not Cotulla. While I'm confident about his time at Welhausen Elementary in Cotulla, I'm less certain about whether he taught in Pearsall or which school it would have been if he did. This seems like a very specific historical detail that I'm not confident about.

Given the risk of losing a point if wrong versus gaining nothing by passing, and my uncertainty about this specific detail regarding Pearsall (as opposed to Cotulla where I know he taught), I should pass.

Question:
Who wrote the music for the Romanian anthem?
----------
  A: Anton Pann
  B: Ciprian Porumbescu
  C: George Enescu
  D: Dimitrie Cantemir
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the Romanian national anthem's composer.

The Romanian national anthem is "Deșteaptă-te, române!" (Awaken thee, Romanian!). Let me consider what I know:

- Anton Pann was a 19th-century Romanian composer and writer
- Ciprian Porumbescu was a Romanian composer known for patriotic music
- George Enescu was Romania's most famous classical composer
- Dimitrie Cantemir was an earlier historical figure

I have some knowledge that suggests the music for "Deșteaptă-te, române!" was composed by Ciprian Porumbescu, though I'm not entirely certain. However, I also recall that Anton Pann was associated with important Romanian cultural works.

Given that this is a specific factual question about Romanian history and I have some uncertainty between at least two of these options, and considering the penalty for wrong answers equals the reward for correct answers, I should be quite confident (significantly above 50%) to make answering worthwhile.

My confidence level is moderate but not high enough to justify the risk given the 1:1 risk-reward ratio.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Maurice Strong's election as the first head of the UN Environment Programme.

What I know:
- Maurice Strong was indeed the first Executive Director of UNEP (UN Environment Programme)
- UNEP was established following the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment
- The timing would be in late 1972 or early 1973

However, I'm uncertain about the exact month and year of his election by the UN General Assembly. This is a very specific historical detail requiring precise knowledge. The options are all clustered around late 1972 to early 1973, which makes sense historically, but I cannot confidently distinguish between October, November, or December 1972, or January 1973.

Given that:
1. This requires very specific historical knowledge
2. I'm not certain of the exact month
3. Getting it wrong costs me a point
4. The risk outweighs the potential reward

Kinoko Teikoku is a Japanese rock band, and I have some knowledge about their discography, but I'm not entirely certain about the specific year of each album release. Let me consider what I know:

- "Uzu ni Naru" (渦になる) was one of their notable albums
- "Fake World Wonderland" and "Long Goodbye" are also albums I'm aware of
- The exact release years are where my uncertainty lies

Given that:
1. This is a very specific question about a Japanese indie/alternative rock band
2. I'm not highly confident about the exact year of their album releases
3. Getting it wrong would cost me a point
4. The risk-reward ratio doesn't favor answering when my confidence is moderate at best

This seems like a question where passing is the more strategic choice given my uncertainty about the specific 2014 release date.

------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a specific quote from the 2013 video game Outlast.

This is asking for a very specific piece of dialogue from a particular scene in Outlast - what Dr. Richard Trager says to Miles Upshur while opening an elevator door right before Trager dies. This requires:
1. Knowledge of the game Outlast
2. Memory of this specific character (Dr. Trager)
3. Recall of the exact quote from a particular scene
4. Knowledge of the context (elevator door, right before his death)

This is extremely specific video game trivia. While I have some general knowledge about Outlast being a horror game, I don't have reliable knowledge of specific dialogue quotes from particular scenes. This is the kind of detail that would require either having played the game recently or having studied specific scene transcripts.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about the exact dialogue, attempting to answer this would be a guess among four options, giving me roughly a 25% chance if purely guessing (though slightly better if I could eliminate options). The expected value of guessing would be negative.

I should PASS on this question.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the sculptor of Christopher Codrington's statue at All Souls College, Oxford.

This is a very specific question about:
- A particular statue (Christopher Codrington)
- At a specific location (All Souls College)
- Requiring knowledge of the sculptor's identity

Christopher Codrington was a benefactor of All Souls College, Oxford. However, I'm not certain about which specific sculptor created his statue. This is quite specialized art history knowledge about a particular college memorial.

The options given are all notable British sculptors from roughly the 18th-19th centuries, but without being certain which one created this specific work, I would essentially be guessing among plausible options.

Given:
- This requires very specific historical/artistic knowledge
- I'm not confident about the correct answer
- Getting it wrong costs me a point
- The risk-reward doesn't favor guessing

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level about this question regarding hydroelectric projects in Jammu and Kashmir, specifically which one is located on the Suru River.

Let me think about what I know:
- The Suru River is a tributary in the Kargil region of Ladakh (formerly part of Jammu and Kashmir)
- I have some knowledge of hydroelectric projects in this region, but this is quite specific geographical information
- Chutak Hydroelectric Plant is one I recall being associated with the Suru River in the Kargil district

However, this is very specific regional infrastructure knowledge, and I could be confusing it with other projects in the area. The consequences of being wrong (-1 point) equal the benefit of being right (+1 point), so I should only answer if I'm reasonably confident (>50% certain).

While I have some recollection that Chutak is on the Suru River, I'm not highly confident in this specific detail, and there's a meaningful chance I could be wrong or confusing projects.

Given the moderate uncertainty, the prudent choice is to pass.

Question:
Name the enzyme that has an enzyme commission number of 3.1.4.2.
----------
  A: Glycerophosphoserine phosphodiesterase
  B: Phosphatidylcholine phospholipase
  C: Phosphatidylinositol phosphodiesterase
  D: Glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about enzyme commission (EC) numbers.

EC 3.1.4.2 is a specific enzyme classification. The EC number system is:
- First digit (3) = Hydrolases
- Second digit (1) = Acting on ester bonds
- Third digit (4) = Phosphoric diester hydrolases
- Fourth digit (2) = Specific enzyme

This is asking for a very specific piece of biochemical knowledge. EC 3.1.4.2 corresponds to phospholipase C, which acts on phosphatidylinositol. Looking at the options, option C mentions "Phosphatidylinositol phosphodiesterase" which would be consistent with this classification.

However, this is highly specialized knowledge, and I'm not completely certain about the exact EC number assignment. The risk of losing a point if wrong versus gaining a point if right needs to be weighed against my confidence level.

My confidence is moderate but not high enough to justify the risk, given that this requires precise recall of a specific EC number from thousands of possibilities.

Question:
In what major painting exhibition did artist J.C. Leyendecker earn a spot in 1897?
----------
  A: The Salon Champs de Mars
  B: The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition
  C: The Paris Salon
  D: The Venice Biennale
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about J.C. Leyendecker and a 1897 painting exhibition.

What I know about J.C. Leyendecker:
- He was a famous American illustrator, particularly known for his work with The Saturday Evening Post
- He was active in the early 20th century
- He studied art in Paris at the Académie Julian in the 1890s

Given that he was studying in Paris in the 1890s and the question asks about 1897, it's plausible he would have participated in a Paris-based exhibition. The Paris Salon (option C) was the most prestigious art exhibition of that era, and many American artists studying in Paris aspired to exhibit there.

However, I'm not certain about the specific exhibition in 1897. While the Paris connection makes sense, I don't have definitive knowledge of this particular fact. The Salon Champs de Mars (option A) was also a Paris-based salon that split from the original Paris Salon.

My confidence level is moderate but not high enough to risk losing a point. This is a very specific historical fact about a particular year and exhibition.

Question:
What was the Word of the Decade (2010–2019) according to the American Dialect Society?
----------
  A: them
  B: we
  C: they
  D: me
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the American Dialect Society's Word of the Decade for 2010-2019.

This is a very specific factual question about a particular organization's decision. The American Dialect Society does make these pronouncements, and I recall that in recent years there has been significant attention to singular "they" as a gender-neutral pronoun. The Word of the Decade announcement would have been made around 2019-2020.

I believe the answer is C: "they" - recognizing the singular "they" pronoun's increased usage and acceptance, particularly in gender-neutral contexts. This fits with the cultural and linguistic trends of that decade.

However, this is a specific factual claim that I could be wrong about. Let me assess my confidence:
- I'm fairly confident about "they" being recognized for its singular usage
- The timeframe (2010-2019) aligns with when this usage became more prominent
- This would be a notable linguistic development worthy of "Word of the Decade"

I'd estimate I'm about 70-75% confident in this answer. Given that correct answers give +1 and wrong answers give -1, with this confidence level, the expected value is positive (roughly 0.7 × 1 + 0.3 × -1 = 0.4).

Question:
How many half-siblings did Louis Moreau Gottschalk have?
----------
  A: 3
  B: 4
  C: 7
  D: 5
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence in answering this question about Louis Moreau Gottschalk's half-siblings.

Louis Moreau Gottschalk was a 19th-century American composer and pianist. This is a very specific biographical detail about his family structure. While I have some general knowledge about Gottschalk, the exact number of half-siblings is a precise factual detail that I'm not confident about. This type of specific genealogical information is easy to get wrong, and the penalty for a wrong answer (-1 point) equals the reward for a correct answer (+1 point).

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact number of half-siblings, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
What is the name of the city and state where Václav Hlavatý, a Czech-American mathematician, died?
----------
  A: Berkeley, California
  B: Cambridge, Massachusetts
  C: Princeton, New Jersey
  D: Bloomington, Indiana
------------------------------

  1: Pass
  2: Answer
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to assess my confidence in answering this question about Václav Hlavatý's death location.

What I know:
- Václav Hlavatý was a Czech-American mathematician
- He worked in differential geometry and relativity theory
- He emigrated to the US after WWII

However, I'm not certain about the specific city and state where he died. This is a very specific biographical detail that requires precise knowledge. The options include major academic centers (Berkeley, Cambridge, Princeton, Bloomington), which suggests he was likely affiliated with a university in one of these locations.

Without strong confidence in knowing the exact location of his death, and given that wrong answers cost me a point while passing costs nothing, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What is the judicial title of the person who was appointed as Chairman of the Scottish Law Commission on January 1, 2014, for a period of five years until December 31, 2018?
----------
  A: Lord Pentland
  B: Lord Carloway
  C: Lord Bracadale
  D: Lord Drummond Young
------------------------------

  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'. Your choice: ; response: ||I need to consider my confidence level on this question about the Scottish Law Commission Chairman appointed on January 1, 2014.

This is a very specific factual question about:
- A specific appointment date (January 1, 2014)
- A specific role (Chairman of the Scottish Law Commission)
- A specific term (5 years until December 31, 2018)
- Scottish judicial titles

This requires precise knowledge of Scottish legal administrative appointments from a specific time period. While I have some general knowledge about Scottish law and legal figures, I'm not confident I have the exact details about this particular appointment. This is the type of highly specific administrative detail that would require verification from reliable sources about Scottish legal history.

Given:
- The specificity of the question
- My uncertainty about the correct answer
- The penalty for wrong answers (-1 point)
- The safety of passing (0 points)

The risk-reward calculation suggests I should pass rather than guess.
