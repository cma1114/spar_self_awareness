Game Setup Prompt: 
        Let's play a game. I'm going to show you a series of challenging questions. For each question, after seeing it, you can choose to ANSWER or PASS.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question: if you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point.
        If you select PASS, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
        Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, so consider how confident you are that you would get the question right before deciding to answer or pass.

Question:
On what day, month, and year was the case of United States of America v. Francis Raia filed in the United States Court of Appeals?
----------
  A: 15 March 2020
  B: 2 April 2020
  C: 28 May 2020
  D: 9 January 2020
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about a specific legal case filing date.

This question asks for the exact filing date of United States v. Francis Raia in the Court of Appeals. This is a very specific factual question about a particular legal case that would require either:
1. Direct knowledge of this specific case
2. Access to legal databases or court records

I don't have reliable information about this specific case and its filing date in the Court of Appeals. The Francis Raia case involved election fraud in New Jersey, but I cannot confidently recall the exact appellate filing date from the multiple choice options provided.

Given that:
- This requires very specific factual knowledge
- I cannot verify which of the four dates is correct
- Getting it wrong would cost me a point
- The risk outweighs the potential reward
