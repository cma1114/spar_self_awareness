Game Setup Prompt: 
        Let's play a game. I'm going to show you a series of challenging questions. For each question, after seeing it, you can choose to ANSWER or PASS.
        If you select ANSWER, I will ask you the question: if you get the answer right, you get 1 point; if you get the answer wrong, you lose 1 point.
        If you select PASS, you neither gain nor lose a point, and I move on to the next question. 
        Your goal is to accumulate as many points as possible.

Question:
What were the month and year when Google hosted a hacking contest aimed at computer security experts called "Pwnium"?
----------
  A: January 2015
  B: October 2013
  C: June 2012
  D: March 2014
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Pass
  2: Answer
You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about when Google hosted a hacking contest called "Pwnium."

Google did host Pwnium contests, which were security competitions focused on finding vulnerabilities in Chrome and other software. However, I'm not certain about the specific month and year of the first or a particular Pwnium event without being able to verify this information.

Pwnium contests were held multiple times, and while I believe some were held around 2012-2013, I cannot confidently pinpoint the exact month and year from the given options without risk of error.

Given the uncertainty and the penalty for wrong answers, this is a question where I should be cautious.

Question:
What are the names of the two mathematicians who received the Salem Prize in 1988?
----------
  A: Alexander Volberg, Jean-Christophe Yoccoz
  B: Jean Bourgain, Christopher Sogge
  C: Terence Tao, Wilhelm Schlag
  D: Peter Sarnak, Thomas Wolff
------------------------------
Choices:
  1: Answer
  2: Pass
You must output only a single number. Your choice ('1' or '2'): ; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about the Salem Prize winners in 1988.

The Salem Prize is awarded to young researchers in analysis. While I have some knowledge about various prize winners, the specific year 1988 and the exact recipients is a very specific historical fact that I'm not completely certain about.

Looking at the options:
- Jean Bourgain was indeed a prominent analyst who won many prizes
- Jean-Christophe Yoccoz was a Fields Medalist
- These are all distinguished mathematicians in analysis

However, I'm not confident enough about the specific year 1988 and which two mathematicians received it that year to risk losing a point. This is a very specific factual question about a particular year's prize recipients.
