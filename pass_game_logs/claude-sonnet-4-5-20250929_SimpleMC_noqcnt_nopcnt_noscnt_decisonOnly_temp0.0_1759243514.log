Question:
What are the names of the two mathematicians who received the Salem Prize in 1988?
----------
  A: Alexander Volberg, Jean-Christophe Yoccoz
  B: Jean Bourgain, Christopher Sogge
  C: Terence Tao, Wilhelm Schlag
  D: Peter Sarnak, Thomas Wolff
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about the Salem Prize winners in 1988.

The Salem Prize is a mathematics prize awarded to young researchers in analysis. However, this is a very specific historical fact about winners from 1988, which is quite detailed information. While I have some knowledge about mathematics prizes, I'm not confident enough about the specific winners in that particular year to risk losing a point.

This is a factual question with no room for reasoning - either I know it or I don't. Given the specificity and my uncertainty, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
In what city did Anselm Kiefer present his first exhibition?
----------
  A: Frankfurt
  B: Munich
  C: Karlsruhe
  D: Düsseldorf
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about Anselm Kiefer's first exhibition location.

Anselm Kiefer is a prominent German artist, but the specific location of his very first exhibition is a detailed biographical fact that I'm not entirely certain about. While I know he studied in Karlsruhe and later became associated with Düsseldorf, I cannot confidently pinpoint which city hosted his first exhibition without risking an incorrect answer.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my uncertainty about this specific detail, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
What's the official motto of the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art?
----------
  A: Cultura et Ingenium
  B: Ars et Humanitas
  C: Litteris et Artibus
  D: Scientia et Veritas
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about the official motto of the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art.

This is a very specific question about an Austrian state decoration. While I have some knowledge about various honors and decorations, the specific motto of the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art is quite obscure. 

Looking at the options:
- "Litteris et Artibus" (For Literature and Arts) is actually associated with a Swedish royal medal
- The other options are plausible Latin phrases for such an honor

However, I'm not confident enough in my knowledge of this specific Austrian decoration's motto to risk losing a point. This is a highly specialized piece of information that I could easily get wrong.

Question:
When NASA's communication director reported in 2020 that NASA planned to land astronauts on the Moon as part of the U.S. Artemis program, what was the total number of female candidates in the program?
----------
  A: Seven
  B: Twelve
  C: Nine
  D: Five
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about the specific number of female candidates in NASA's Artemis program as reported in 2020.

This is a very specific factual question about:
- A specific year (2020)
- A specific NASA announcement
- The exact number of female candidates at that time

While I know about the Artemis program in general, the exact number of female candidates at a specific point in 2020 is a precise detail that I'm not confident about. The answer choices are relatively close numbers (5, 7, 9, 12), which means guessing would have a high risk of being wrong.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about this exact detail, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Who was the goalkeeper with the most clean sheets in the 2019-2020 Primeira Liga?
----------
  A: Rui Patrício
  B: Agustín Marchesín
  C: Odysseas Vlachodimos
  D: Antonio Adán
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about the 2019-2020 Primeira Liga (Portuguese football league) goalkeeper statistics.

This is a very specific statistical question about a particular season in the Portuguese league. While I have some general knowledge about football, the specific clean sheet leader for that exact season is a detailed statistic that I'm not confident about. The options include well-known Portuguese league goalkeepers, but without certain knowledge of the exact statistics from that season, I risk losing a point.

Question:
What is the name of the man who succeeded Gösta Mittag-Leffler as a professor of mathematics at Stockholm University in July 1911?
----------
  A: Ivar Otto Bendixson
  B: Lars Edvard Phragmén
  C: Torsten Carleman
  D: Niels Fabian Helge von Koch
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about who succeeded Gösta Mittag-Leffler as a professor of mathematics at Stockholm University in July 1911.

This is a very specific historical question about Swedish mathematics history. While I know Mittag-Leffler was an important Swedish mathematician, the exact succession details in July 1911 are quite obscure. All four options are Swedish mathematicians from roughly the right era, which makes this challenging.

Without being confident in my knowledge of this specific succession event, answering risks losing a point. This is a specialized historical fact that I'm not certain about.

Question:
Which famous drummer opened a Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant in Norco, California, in 2004?
----------
  A: Chad Smith
  B: Dave Grohl
  C: Tommy Lee
  D: Travis Barker
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about which drummer opened a Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant in Norco, California in 2004.

Let me consider what I know:
- Travis Barker is known to have business ventures including restaurants
- Travis Barker is from Southern California (Fontana, which is near Norco)
- He's been associated with Wahoo's Fish Taco brand
- The other drummers listed don't have as strong a connection to this specific restaurant chain

I'm fairly confident the answer is D: Travis Barker, given his Southern California roots and known association with Wahoo's Fish Taco.

Question:
How many total lunar eclipses were there in 1982?
----------
  A: 3
  B: 1
  C: 4
  D: 2
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider whether I can reliably answer this question about the number of total lunar eclipses in 1982.

This is a very specific astronomical fact that requires precise historical data. While I have some knowledge about lunar eclipses, the exact number of total lunar eclipses in a specific year like 1982 is not something I'm confident about without verification.

Lunar eclipses follow patterns, but the specific count for a given year varies. There can be 0-3 lunar eclipses per year, and not all are total eclipses. Without being certain of the correct answer, guessing would be risky since I lose a point for being wrong.

Given the uncertainty and the penalty for wrong answers, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
Which Indian cricketer has been appointed UNICEF and Cricket for Good Ambassador for the ICC Women’s World Cup 2017?
----------
  A: Rahul Dravid
  B: Sachin Tendulkar
  C: Virat Kohli
  D: MS Dhoni
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about this specific appointment for the ICC Women's World Cup 2017.

This is a very specific factual question about:
- A specific event (ICC Women's World Cup 2017)
- A specific role (UNICEF and Cricket for Good Ambassador)
- A specific Indian cricketer

While I recognize all the names listed as famous Indian cricketers, this is asking about a particular appointment for a women's cricket event in 2017. I don't have confident knowledge about which of these male cricketers was appointed to this specific ambassadorial role for the women's tournament.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
What day, month, and year did William II of Holland become King of Germany?
----------
  A: 9 November 1247
  B: 22 January 1248
  C: 3 October 1247
  D: 15 May 1246
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about when William II of Holland became King of Germany.

William II of Holland (Willem II van Holland) was elected King of Germany/King of the Romans in the mid-13th century. This is a fairly obscure historical fact with specific dates that could easily be confused.

While I have some knowledge that he was elected in 1247, I'm not confident about the exact day and month. The specific date options given (November 9, 1247; January 22, 1248; October 3, 1247; May 15, 1246) require precise historical knowledge that I'm uncertain about.

Given:
- This is very specific historical information
- The penalty for wrong answers equals the reward for right answers (-1 vs +1)
- I'm not confident in distinguishing between these specific dates
- The risk-reward ratio doesn't favor guessing

Question:
Who was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive?
----------
  A: Albrecht Dürer
  B: Leonardo da Vinci
  C: Michelangelo Buonarroti
  D: Raphael Sanzio
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider whether I'm confident enough about this question to risk answering it.

This question is about art history, specifically about biographical documentation of Renaissance artists. The key detail is "first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive."

I know that Giorgio Vasari wrote "Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects" which included biographies of many Renaissance artists. Michelangelo was indeed alive when Vasari's first edition was published in 1550, and Vasari wrote about him. This was quite significant because it was unusual to write biographies of living artists at that time.

While I'm reasonably confident about Michelangelo (C), I should consider if any of the others might have had earlier biographies:
- Albrecht Dürer died in 1528
- Leonardo da Vinci died in 1519
- Raphael died in 1520
- Michelangelo died in 1564

Given the timing and my knowledge of Vasari's work being groundbreaking in this regard, I'm fairly confident the answer is C: Michelangelo Buonarroti.

Question:
Who performed the theme song for the 1989 Leeds International Film Festival opener *Shirley Valentine*?
----------
  A: Diana Ross
  B: Patti Austin
  C: Gladys Knight
  D: Roberta Flack
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider what I know about the theme song for "Shirley Valentine" (1989).

The film "Shirley Valentine" had a theme song called "The Girl Who Used to Be Me," which was performed by Pauline Collins in some versions, but the main theme song that became well-known was performed by a notable artist.

However, I'm not entirely certain which of these four specific artists performed the theme song. This is a very specific question about a 1989 film's theme song, and while I have some knowledge about the film, I'm not confident enough about which of these four options is correct.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safety of passing (0 points), and my uncertainty about this specific detail, the strategic choice is to pass.

Question:
At the time of his birth, what was the name of the town in which the former Prime Minister of Poland Kazimierz Władysław Bartel was born?
----------
  A: Prague
  B: Vienna
  C: Lemberg.
  D: Krakow
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider whether I can confidently answer this question about Kazimierz Władysław Bartel's birthplace.

Kazimierz Bartel was a Polish mathematician and politician who served as Prime Minister of Poland multiple times in the interwar period. He was born in 1882 in Lwów (Lviv). At the time of his birth in 1882, this city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and was known by its German name "Lemberg" (the Polish name was Lwów).

Looking at the options:
- A: Prague - No
- B: Vienna - No
- C: Lemberg - This matches the German name for Lwów at that time
- D: Krakow - No

I'm confident the answer is C: Lemberg.

- Jovian was a Roman emperor who ruled briefly in the 360s CE
- He became emperor after the death of Julian the Apostate
- Julian died during a campaign against Persia in June 363
- Jovian was proclaimed emperor shortly after Julian's death
- He ruled for only about 8 months before dying in February 364

Based on this knowledge, Jovian became emperor in June 363, which would correspond to option B: 27 June 363.

I'm reasonably confident about this answer, as the historical timeline of Julian's death in June 363 and Jovian's immediate succession is well-documented.

Question:
Who wrote "The Nightmarket" episode of Season 4 in "What We Do in the Shadows"?
----------
  A: Yana Gorskaya and Jemaine Clement
  B: William Meny and Paul Simms
  C: Sam Johnson and Stefani Robinson
  D: Marika Sawyer and Jake Bender
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about the specific writer credits for "The Nightmarket" episode from Season 4 of "What We Do in the Shadows."

This is a very specific question about TV writing credits for a particular episode. While I know "What We Do in the Shadows" is a popular mockumentary comedy series, I don't have confident knowledge about the specific writing credits for individual episodes, especially for a particular episode title from Season 4.

This type of detailed production credit information is:
- Very specific and factual
- Easy to verify but hard to know with certainty without access to current databases
- Has a significant risk of error if I guess

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the reward for correct answers (+1 point), and my lack of confident knowledge about this specific episode's writers, the expected value of answering is negative.

Question:
Until which day, month, and year was Jules Ferry in office as the Prime Minister of France for the second time?
----------
  A: 30 March 1885
  B: 15 April 1885
  C: 8 May 1885
  D: 22 February 1885
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to determine whether I should answer this question about Jules Ferry's second term as Prime Minister of France.

This is a very specific historical question asking for the exact end date of Jules Ferry's second term as Prime Minister of France. Jules Ferry did serve two terms as Prime Minister, and his second term was in the 1880s.

From my knowledge, Jules Ferry's second term as Prime Minister ended on March 30, 1885, when his government fell due to controversies over colonial policy in Indochina (specifically the Tonkin Affair).

This matches option A: 30 March 1885.

I'm reasonably confident in this answer, as it's a well-documented historical fact about a significant French political figure.

Question:
What were the year and month when the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China was abolished?
----------
  A: December 2019
  B: January 2021
  C: July 2021
  D: March 2020
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about when the Contract Law of the People's Republic of China was abolished.

The Contract Law of the People's Republic of China was indeed abolished when the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China came into effect on January 1, 2021. This means the Contract Law was abolished in January 2021.

Looking at the options:
- A: December 2019 - Too early
- B: January 2021 - This matches my knowledge
- C: July 2021 - Too late
- D: March 2020 - Too early

I'm confident about this answer as the Civil Code's implementation date is a significant legal milestone that was widely reported.

Question:
Name the mission director of the Rohini Satellite 1 (RS-1) satellite launch in 1980.
----------
  A: Dr. Rao
  B: Dr. Dhawan
  C: Dr. Kalam
  D: Dr. Sarabhai
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about the mission director of India's Rohini Satellite 1 (RS-1) launch in 1980.

This is a very specific historical question about India's space program. The RS-1 was India's first satellite to be launched using an indigenous launch vehicle (SLV-3). 

The key figures mentioned:
- Dr. Kalam (APJ Abdul Kalam) was closely associated with India's satellite launch vehicle program and the SLV-3 project
- Dr. Sarabhai founded ISRO but passed away in 1971
- Dr. Dhawan was ISRO chairman during this period
- Dr. Rao could refer to U.R. Rao

While I have some knowledge suggesting Dr. Kalam's involvement with the SLV-3 program, I'm not certain about the specific title of "mission director" for this particular launch. This is a very specific detail that I could easily get wrong.

Given the specificity of the question and my uncertainty about the exact role designation, the risk of losing a point seems higher than the potential gain.

Question:
What day, month, and year did Lothair I, King of Italy, become King of Middle Francia?
----------
  A: 7 December 841
  B: 10 August 843
  C: 15 September 840
  D: 23 June 845
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I can confidently answer this question about Lothair I becoming King of Middle Francia.

This is a very specific historical question about medieval European history. Lothair I was indeed a Carolingian ruler, and Middle Francia was created by the Treaty of Verdun in 843, which divided the Carolingian Empire among the three grandsons of Charlemagne.

The Treaty of Verdun was signed in August 843, and this is when Lothair I officially became King of Middle Francia (though he retained the title of Emperor). Option B states "10 August 843," which aligns with the Treaty of Verdun.

However, I should be cautious because:
- The exact day of the treaty is sometimes debated in historical sources
- This is an extremely specific date question
- Getting it wrong would cost me a point

That said, I have reasonable confidence that the answer is B (10 August 843), as this corresponds to the Treaty of Verdun which created Middle Francia.

  A: Norman Rockwell
  B: Charles Gibson
  C: Edward Penﬁeld

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about who was President of the Society of Illustrators from 1921-1922.

This is a very specific historical fact about a professional organization's leadership from over 100 years ago. While I recognize the names listed (all are famous illustrators from that era), I don't have confident knowledge about the specific presidency dates of the Society of Illustrators.

- Norman Rockwell was a famous illustrator but I'm not certain about his role in the Society
- Charles Gibson (likely Charles Dana Gibson) was known for the "Gibson Girl"
- Edward Penfield was a poster artist
- Howard Pyle was an illustrator and teacher

Without reliable knowledge of this specific administrative detail, guessing would give me only a 25% chance of success versus a 75% chance of losing a point.

Question:
Which of the three Olympic fencing weapons was the last one to transition to using electrical equipment?
----------
  A: Foil
  B: Rapier
  C: Épée
  D: Sabre
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I'll analyze this question about Olympic fencing weapons.

The question asks which weapon was the LAST to transition to electrical equipment.

Key facts I know:
- There are three Olympic fencing weapons: Foil, Épée, and Sabre
- Rapier is NOT an Olympic fencing weapon, so option B can be eliminated
- Foil and Épée transitioned to electrical scoring in the 1950s
- Sabre was the last to adopt electrical scoring, doing so in the 1980s (around 1988 for Olympic competition)

The answer should be D: Sabre.

Since I'm confident about this answer and can eliminate one option immediately (Rapier is not an Olympic weapon), I should answer.

Question:
Who won the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Computer and Cognitive Science in 2003?

  A: Allen Newell
  B: John McCarthy
  C: Herbert Simon
  D: Marvin Minsky

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to determine whether I should answer this question about the Benjamin Franklin Medal for Computer and Cognitive Science in 2003.

Let me consider what I know:
- The Benjamin Franklin Medal is a prestigious award
- The options listed are all pioneers in AI and computer science
- Allen Newell and Herbert Simon often worked together at Carnegie Mellon
- John McCarthy coined the term "artificial intelligence"
- Marvin Minsky was a co-founder of MIT's AI laboratory

However, I'm not certain about the specific winner in 2003. This is a very specific factual question about a particular year's award recipient. Without being confident in the answer, guessing would risk losing a point.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact year and recipient, the strategic choice is to pass.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about the specific asteroids discovered by Édouard Jean-Marie Stephan and their order of discovery.

Édouard Stephan was a French astronomer who discovered several asteroids in the 19th century. However, I'm not certain about the exact order of his discoveries and which was specifically his second asteroid discovery. This is a very specific historical astronomy question that requires precise knowledge of discovery dates and sequences.

Given the uncertainty and the risk of losing a point with an incorrect answer, I should pass on this question.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about the 16th Miss World pageant presenters.

The 16th Miss World pageant would have been held in 1966 (Miss World started in 1951). This is a very specific historical fact about a particular edition of a pageant from nearly 60 years ago. While I have some general knowledge about Miss World, I'm not confident about the specific presenters of this particular edition.

Looking at the options, they all contain names of well-known British television presenters from that era, which makes this question particularly tricky without certain knowledge.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

How many biological children did Isadora Duncan have?

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider what I know about Isadora Duncan and her biological children.

Isadora Duncan was a famous American dancer and choreographer from the early 20th century. I recall that she had a tragic personal life, including the loss of children in a drowning accident. I believe she had two biological children - Deirdre and Patrick - who both died in 1913 when the car they were in rolled into the Seine River in Paris.

I'm fairly confident the answer is B: 2.

*Batman R.I.P.* was written by Grant Morrison, a Scottish comic book writer. Before becoming famous for comics, Grant Morrison was in a band called **The Mixers** in the 1980s.

I'm confident about this answer.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about this specific question.

This question asks about the composer of the opening theme song for "The American Album of Familiar Music," which was a radio program. This is a very specific piece of historical trivia about early radio programming.

I don't have confident knowledge about this particular radio program's theme song composer. While I recognize some of the names listed (like William Grant Still, a notable African American composer), I cannot reliably determine which one composed this specific theme song.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
In which genus was the orange-spotted bulbul originally described in 1821?
----------
  A: Turdus
  B: Muscicapa
  C: Sylvia
  D: Pycnonotus
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about the orange-spotted bulbul's original taxonomic classification from 1821.

The orange-spotted bulbul is currently in the genus Pycnonotus (the bulbul genus). However, the question asks about its *original* description in 1821, which could be different from its current classification. Many birds were originally described in different genera before being reclassified.

In the early 19th century, many passerine birds were initially placed in broad genera like:
- Turdus (thrushes)
- Muscicapa (flycatchers)
- Sylvia (warblers)

Without specific knowledge of this particular historical taxonomic detail, this is a risky question. The answer could be any of these options, and I don't have confident knowledge about the specific original genus from 1821.

Question:
For which work was Richard F. Fenno Jr. awarded the D.B. Hardeman Prize?
----------
  A: The Making of a Senator: Dan Quayle
  B: The Emergence of a Senate Leader: Pete Domenici
  C: Home Style: House Members in Their Districts
  D: Congress at the Grassroots: Representational Change in the South
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about Richard F. Fenno Jr.'s D.B. Hardeman Prize.

Richard F. Fenno Jr. was a prominent political scientist who studied Congress. The D.B. Hardeman Prize is awarded for the best book about Congress. While I'm familiar with Fenno's major works like "Home Style: House Members in Their Districts," I'm not certain which specific work won the D.B. Hardeman Prize. This is a very specific factual question about an academic award, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given the uncertainty about which specific work won this particular prize, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Who was the 2nd chairman of the Senate of Pakistan?
----------
  A: Syed Fakhar Imam
  B: Ghulam Ishaq Khan
  C: Wasim Sajjad
  D: Habibullah Khan Marwat
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about the 2nd chairman of the Senate of Pakistan.

This is a very specific historical question about Pakistani political history. The chairman of the Senate of Pakistan is an important position, but the question asks specifically about the 2nd person to hold this office, which requires detailed knowledge of the chronological order of Senate chairmen.

I don't have high confidence in my knowledge of this specific detail. While I may have some information about Pakistani political figures, identifying specifically the 2nd chairman (as opposed to other notable chairmen) is quite precise and I could easily confuse the order.

Given the risk of losing a point with uncertain knowledge on such a specific historical detail, the prudent choice is to pass.

Question:
Which scientist received the Penrose Medal after the year Hollis Dow Hedberg received his?
----------
  A: James Gilluly
  B: Arthur Newell Strahler
  C: William C. Krumbein
  D: John Rodgers
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to determine whether I should answer this question about the Penrose Medal recipients.

This question requires specific knowledge about:
1. When Hollis Dow Hedberg received the Penrose Medal
2. Which of the listed scientists received it after that year

The Penrose Medal is awarded by the Geological Society of America. This is a very specific factual question about the chronological order of award recipients.

Without being certain of the exact years these geologists received the Penrose Medal, answering this question carries significant risk. This is highly specialized knowledge in the history of geology awards, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about the exact timeline of Penrose Medal recipients, the prudent choice is to pass.

Question:
What is the name of the ship named after Habba Khatoon?
----------
  A: INS Habba Khatoon
  B: CGS Habba Khatoon
  C: HMS Habba Khatoon
  D: USS Habba Khatoon
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about a ship named after Habba Khatoon.

Habba Khatoon was a famous Kashmiri poet from the 16th century. However, I'm not certain about whether there is actually a ship named after her, and if so, which naval prefix it would have (INS for Indian Naval Ship, CGS for Canadian/Coast Guard Ship, HMS for Her Majesty's Ship, or USS for United States Ship).

Given that Habba Khatoon was a Kashmiri poet and Kashmir is in India, if there were a ship named after her, it would most likely be an Indian vessel (INS). However, I'm not confident enough in this knowledge to risk losing a point.

This appears to be a very specific factual question where I could easily be wrong.

Question:
What were the first, middle, and last names of the second son of Amadeus Mozart?
----------
  A: Karl Thomas Mozart.
  B: Franz Xaver Mozart
  C: Johann Chrysostom Mozart
  D: Leopold Alexander Mozart
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider whether I can confidently answer this question about Mozart's second son.

Mozart had six children, though only two survived to adulthood. His sons who survived were:
1. Karl Thomas Mozart (first surviving son)
2. Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart (second surviving son)

The question asks specifically for the "second son" - this could mean either the second son born, or the second surviving son. Franz Xaver was indeed Mozart's second surviving son and youngest child.

However, I need to be careful about the exact order of all births. If counting all children born (not just survivors), the order might be different.

Looking at the options:
- A: Karl Thomas Mozart (first surviving son)
- B: Franz Xaver Mozart (second surviving son - though his full name was Franz Xaver Wolfgang)
- C: Johann Chrysostom Mozart (this was actually Mozart's own middle names)
- D: Leopold Alexander Mozart (I'm not certain about this one)

There's ambiguity here about whether "second son" means second born or second surviving, and option B doesn't include "Wolfgang" which was part of Franz Xaver's name.

Given the uncertainty and the potential for confusion, this is risky.

Question:
Who was the director of the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences between 1951 and 1972?
----------
  A: Dmitri Skobeltsyn
  B: Vitaly Ginzburg
  C: Igor Tamm
  D: Sergei Vavilov
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about the director of the Lebedev Physical Institute between 1951 and 1972.

This is a very specific historical question about Soviet/Russian physics administration. Let me think about what I know:

- Dmitri Skobeltsyn was a Soviet physicist known for cosmic ray research
- Vitaly Ginzburg was a Nobel laureate in physics (2003) for superconductivity work
- Igor Tamm was a Nobel laureate (1958) for Cherenkov radiation work
- Sergei Vavilov was a prominent Soviet physicist who died in 1951

The timeframe 1951-1972 is quite specific. Sergei Vavilov died in 1951, so he couldn't have been director during most of this period. This is a very specialized question about Soviet scientific administration history, and while I have some knowledge of these physicists, I'm not confident about the specific administrative role and exact dates.

Given the specificity required and the potential for confusion, this seems like a question where I could easily be wrong.

Question:
Who sketched the "Taddei Tondo" soon after it arrived in England and wrote this to Sir George Beaumont: "Your important acquisition of the basso-relievo of Michael Angelo is still the chief talk of all our artists"?
----------
  A: John Constable
  B: David Wilkie
  C: Thomas Lawrence
  D: William Blake
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have sufficient confidence to answer this question about who sketched the "Taddei Tondo" and wrote to Sir George Beaumont.

This is a very specific art history question about:
1. The Taddei Tondo (a marble relief by Michelangelo)
2. Its arrival in England
3. Who sketched it and wrote a specific letter to Sir George Beaumont

This requires detailed knowledge of early 19th-century British art history and the provenance of the Taddei Tondo. While I know the Taddei Tondo is a Michelangelo work, the specific details about who sketched it upon its arrival in England and wrote this particular letter is highly specialized information.

The candidates are all prominent British artists from roughly the right period (late 18th/early 19th century). However, without strong confidence in which specific artist performed these actions, this is a risky question where guessing could easily result in a -1 point.

Given the highly specific nature of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, the prudent choice is to pass.

Question:
What was the first and last name of the first female who won all four major performing arts awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (EGOT)?
----------
  A: Helen Hayes
  B: Audrey Hepburn
  C: Rita Moreno
  D: Julie Andrews
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to determine who was the first woman to achieve EGOT status.

Let me think through what I know:
- EGOT refers to winning all four major awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony
- Helen Hayes was one of the early EGOT winners
- Rita Moreno achieved EGOT status
- The question asks specifically about the FIRST female to do so

Helen Hayes completed her EGOT in 1977 (though there's some debate about competitive vs. honorary awards). Rita Moreno completed hers in 1977 as well. However, Helen Hayes is generally recognized as having achieved this first among women.

I'm reasonably confident that Helen Hayes (option A) is the correct answer, as she is widely recognized as the first woman to achieve EGOT status.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about Pakistani political history.

This is a specific factual question about the first female Deputy Speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly. Let me consider what I know:

- Benazir Bhutto was Prime Minister, not Deputy Speaker
- Hina Rabbani Khar was Foreign Minister
- Fatima Jinnah was a political leader but I don't recall her being Deputy Speaker
- Ashraf Abbasi - I'm not certain about this person's role

This is a very specific historical fact about Pakistani parliamentary history. I don't have strong confidence in any of these answers, and getting it wrong would cost me a point. The risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain when my knowledge is uncertain.

Question:
In which month and year was the first public exhibition of Pablo Picasso’s "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"?
----------
  A: June 1907
  B: October 1908
  C: March 1915
  D: July 1916
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider what I know about "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" by Picasso.

This painting was completed in 1907, but it was NOT publicly exhibited immediately. Picasso kept it in his studio for many years because it was so controversial and radical. The painting was first publicly exhibited much later than its creation date.

The first public exhibition was at the Salon d'Antin in Paris in July 1916, nearly a decade after it was painted.

I'm reasonably confident about this historical fact.

Question:
At what school was Leo Strauss working when he died?

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to determine whether I should answer this question about Leo Strauss or pass.

Leo Strauss was a prominent political philosopher. I recall that he had a long association with the University of Chicago, where he spent much of his career. He died in 1973, and I believe he was still affiliated with the University of Chicago at that time.

Given that I have reasonable confidence in this answer (University of Chicago - option C), I should answer rather than pass.

Based on my knowledge, there was a total lunar eclipse on November 8, 2022, and the next total lunar eclipse won't occur until March 2025 - which is approximately a three-year gap.

This matches option D: November 8, 2022.

I'm confident in this answer.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I should answer this question about the first Sazae-san strip publication date.

This is a very specific historical question about a Japanese manga series. Sazae-san is a famous Japanese comic strip, but the exact date of its first publication in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper is quite obscure trivia. 

I'm not confident about the precise date. While I know Sazae-san is historically significant and ran in various newspapers, pinpointing the exact day, month, and year of its first appearance in the Asahi Shimbun specifically requires very detailed knowledge that I'm uncertain about.

Given that:
- Getting it wrong costs me 1 point
- Passing costs me 0 points
- I'm not confident in my answer

The risk-reward calculation suggests I should pass on this question.

  A: Cléopâtre
  B: Schéhérazade
  C: Médée
  D: Salomé
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about this specific ballet question.

This is asking about a very specific fact: a ballet created by Valery Matveevich Panov for the Istanbul Devlet Ballet in 1988. This is quite obscure and requires detailed knowledge of:
- Valery Panov's choreographic works
- His specific work with the Istanbul State Ballet
- The exact year 1988

While I know Panov was a famous Soviet ballet dancer who defected and later became a choreographer, I don't have confident, specific knowledge about which ballet he created for Istanbul in 1988. This is a very specialized piece of ballet history.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
Provide the day, month, and year Gazprom became the official Global Energy Partner of the UEFA Champions League 2012 winners, Chelsea.
----------

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about when Gazprom became Chelsea's sponsor.

This is a very specific question asking for the exact day, month, and year of a sponsorship announcement. While I know Gazprom was indeed a sponsor of Chelsea and a UEFA Champions League partner, I don't have confident knowledge of the precise date this partnership was announced.

This type of highly specific date question is risky - getting it wrong would cost me a point, while passing costs me nothing. Without being certain of the exact date, the prudent choice is to pass.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to determine when Preston Ercelle Cloud Jr. received the Penrose Medal and which of these scientists received it before him.

This is a very specific question about the history of the Penrose Medal (awarded by the Geological Society of America). Without certain knowledge of the exact years each scientist received this medal, I risk losing a point if I guess incorrectly.

This is too specialized and fact-specific for me to be confident in my answer.

Question:
Which U.S. president was the last one to be born in the 18th century?
----------
  A: James Buchanan
  B: Millard Fillmore
  C: Franklin Pierce
  D: Zachary Taylor
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to determine which U.S. president was the last born in the 18th century (before 1800).

Let me think through the birth years of these presidents:
- James Buchanan: born 1791
- Millard Fillmore: born 1800
- Franklin Pierce: born 1804
- Zachary Taylor: born 1784

Since the 18th century ended on December 31, 1799, anyone born in 1800 or later was born in the 19th century.

Between Buchanan (1791) and Taylor (1784), Buchanan was born later, making him the last president born in the 18th century among all U.S. presidents.

The answer is A: James Buchanan.

Question:
What was the nationality of the scientists who used lasers to measure Usain Bolt’s performance in the different stages of a 100-meter race held in September 2011?
----------
  A: Dutch
  B: German
  C: Belgian
  D: Swedish
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about this specific event.

This question asks about a very specific event: scientists using lasers to measure Usain Bolt's performance in a 100-meter race in September 2011, and their nationality.

While I know Usain Bolt was a famous sprinter and that scientists have studied his performances, I don't have confident, specific knowledge about which nationality of scientists used lasers to measure his performance in a race specifically in September 2011. This is a very detailed factual question that requires precise knowledge of a particular scientific study.

Without being certain of the answer, guessing would give me only a 25% chance of being correct (1 point) versus a 75% chance of being wrong (-1 point), resulting in a negative expected value of -0.5 points.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about when Vanessa Hudgens married Cole Tucker.

This is a very specific factual question about a celebrity wedding date. While I know Vanessa Hudgens is a singer/actress and Cole Tucker is a baseball player, I don't have confident knowledge of their exact wedding date. Celebrity wedding dates are specific facts that I may not have accurate information about, especially if this occurred recently or if my training data doesn't include this information.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about this particular fact, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

  B: April 8, 2020
  C: April 22, 2020
  D: April 15, 2020
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to determine whether I should answer this question about the air date of the second episode of Season 2 of "What We Do in the Shadows."

This is a very specific factual question about a TV show's episode air date. While I have some knowledge about this show, the exact air date of a specific episode is quite detailed information that I'm not completely certain about. Season 2 of "What We Do in the Shadows" aired in 2020, and I believe it started in April 2020, but I'm not confident about the exact date of the second episode.

Given that:
- Getting it wrong costs me 1 point
- Getting it right gains me 1 point
- Passing costs me nothing
- I'm not highly confident in the specific air date

The risk-reward calculation suggests I should pass on this question since my uncertainty is high.

Question:
In whose honor was the Leipzig 1877 tournament organized?
----------
  A: Howard Staunton
  B: Wilhelm Steinitz
  C: Paul Morphy
  D: Adolf Anderssen
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I'll analyze this question about chess history.

The Leipzig 1877 tournament is a specific historical chess event. Let me consider what I know:

- Adolf Anderssen was a prominent German chess master who died in 1879
- The Leipzig 1877 tournament was indeed organized as a memorial/honor tournament
- Anderssen was from Breslau (now Wrocław) but was a major figure in German chess
- The timing (1877) and location (Leipzig, Germany) align with honoring Anderssen

The other options:
- Howard Staunton (English player) died in 1874
- Paul Morphy (American player) died in 1884, so wouldn't be honored in 1877
- Wilhelm Steinitz was still actively playing in 1877

I'm fairly confident this tournament was organized in honor of Adolf Anderssen, though I want to verify the specific circumstances. Given the date, location, and the prominence of Anderssen in German chess history, option D seems most likely.

----------
  A: Interstate 394

  C: Interstate 494
  D: Interstate 694
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to determine whether I should answer this question about the location of the KTCZ-FM transmitter near Ramby Avenue and which interstate is nearby.

This is a very specific question about:
- KTCZ-FM transmitter location
- Ramby Avenue
- KMSP Tower
- Which interstate is near this location

This requires detailed local knowledge of Minnesota geography and radio station infrastructure. Without being certain of the specific location of Ramby Avenue and the KMSP Tower transmitter site, I could easily guess wrong among the four interstate options.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact location, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
How many girls are in "Girls on the Bridge," Munch's painting from 1900 (in the version where some of them are looking at the river)?
----------
  A: Five
  B: Three
  C: Two
  D: Four
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider what I know about Edvard Munch's "Girls on the Bridge" from 1900.

Munch created several versions of this painting. The question specifically asks about the version where "some of them are looking at the river." This is a specific detail that suggests there are multiple figures, with some oriented toward the water.

From what I recall about this painting, there are typically three girls depicted on a bridge, with at least some of them looking down at the water below. However, I'm not entirely certain about the exact number in the specific 1900 version mentioned.

Given the uncertainty about which exact version is being referenced and the specific count, this is a risky question. But based on my general knowledge of this painting, three girls seems most likely.

I'll answer this question.

**2**

Wait, let me reconsider - I should respond with 1 to ANSWER or 2 to PASS.

Given my reasonable confidence that the answer is likely B (Three), I'll choose to answer.

Question:
Who was the commencement speaker at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1994?

  A: Her Majesty Queen Noor of Jordan

  C: His Highness Karim Aga Khan IV
  D: His Excellency Nelson Mandela
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about MIT's 1994 commencement speaker.

This is a very specific historical fact - the commencement speaker at a particular university in a specific year. While I have some knowledge about notable commencement speakers, I'm not confident about this particular detail from 1994.

Looking at the options:
- Queen Noor of Jordan
- Prince Charles
- Aga Khan IV
- Nelson Mandela

All are prominent figures who could plausibly give commencement speeches. Nelson Mandela became President of South Africa in 1994, which was a historically significant year for him, making him a likely candidate for major speaking engagements. However, I'm not certain enough about this specific fact to risk losing a point.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty, the strategic choice is to pass.

  D: 2 May 1970
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about the first Two Oceans Marathon in Cape Town.

The Two Oceans Marathon is a famous ultramarathon in Cape Town, South Africa. However, I'm not certain about the exact date of the first race. This is a very specific historical fact that requires precise knowledge.

Without being confident in the exact date, answering would be a guess among four options, giving me only a 25% chance of being correct if I guess randomly. The expected value of guessing would be: 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = -0.5 points.

Since I'm not confident about this specific historical date, the prudent choice is to pass.

What is Frida Kahlo's largest painting called in English?
----------
  A: Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird
  B: The Two Fridas.
  C: The Wounded Deer
  D: The Broken Column
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to determine if I should answer this question about Frida Kahlo's largest painting.

Let me consider what I know:
- Frida Kahlo created many paintings, most of which were relatively small
- "The Two Fridas" (Las Dos Fridas) is one of her most famous works and is notably one of her largest paintings at approximately 173 cm × 173 cm (5.7 ft × 5.7 ft)
- The other options listed are smaller works
- "Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird" is a small painting
- "The Wounded Deer" is also relatively small
- "The Broken Column" is a medium-sized self-portrait

I'm quite confident that "The Two Fridas" is her largest painting among these options and is generally recognized as one of her largest works overall.

Question:
Which 2016 IGN award did the TV series Hannibal not win?
----------
  A: Best TV Series
  B: Best Drama Series
  C: Best Adapted Series
  D: Best Thriller Series
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider what I know about the TV series Hannibal and IGN awards from 2016.

Hannibal was a critically acclaimed thriller/drama series that aired from 2013-2015, so by 2016 it had already ended. The show was known for being a psychological thriller based on Thomas Harris's novels (making it an adapted series).

However, I'm not certain about the specific IGN awards Hannibal won or didn't win in 2016. This is a very specific factual question about awards from a particular year, and without being certain of the exact awards the show received or didn't receive, guessing could easily result in a wrong answer and losing a point.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the exact 2016 IGN awards for Hannibal, the safer choice is to pass.

Question:
What city was Richard Serra in when he created his work "To Lift"?
----------
  A: San Francisco
  B: Los Angeles
  C: Chicago
  D: New York
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about Richard Serra's work "To Lift" and where he created it.

Richard Serra is a famous sculptor known for his large-scale steel sculptures. "To Lift" is one of his early works from around 1967. This was part of his "Verb List" series where he explored actions like "to roll," "to crease," "to lift," etc.

I believe "To Lift" was created in New York, where Serra was based in the late 1960s. However, I'm not completely certain about this specific detail, and the consequences of being wrong (-1 point) equal the reward for being right (+1 point).

Given that I have some uncertainty about this specific biographical detail, and the risk-reward is symmetric, I should be cautious.

Question:
In what year was Virgil K. Smith's (Michigan politician) driver's license revoked after being charged with operating a vehicle while impaired in February 2004 and operating a vehicle while intoxicated in August 2004?
----------
  A: 2003
  B: 2005
  C: 2006
  D: 2004
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I should answer this question or pass.

This question asks about a specific detail regarding Michigan politician Virgil K. Smith's driver's license revocation following DUI charges in 2004. This is a very specific factual question about:
- A specific politician
- Specific dates of charges (February 2004 and August 2004)
- The year his license was actually revoked

This is highly specific information that I would need reliable knowledge about to answer correctly. While the charges occurred in 2004, the revocation could have happened in 2004, 2005, or even 2006 depending on legal proceedings and administrative processes.

Without certain knowledge of this specific case and its timeline, I risk losing a point by guessing. The question is too specific and obscure for me to be confident in any answer.

  A: Peter Scholze and Maryna Viazovska
  B: Terence Tao and Ben Green
  C: Bo'az Klartag and Assaf Naor
  D: Alessio Figalli and Peter Kronheimer
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to determine if I can confidently answer this question about Salem Prize recipients.

The question asks about the two scientists who received the Salem Prize after Akshay Venkatesh received his. To answer this, I would need to know:
1. When Akshay Venkatesh received the Salem Prize
2. Who received it in the subsequent years

Akshay Venkatesh received the Salem Prize in 2007. The Salem Prize is typically awarded to one or two mathematicians each year. However, I'm not completely certain about the exact recipients in the years immediately following 2007, and the specific pairing mentioned in the options.

Given the specificity required and my uncertainty about the exact chronological order of Salem Prize recipients after 2007, this is a risky question where I could easily lose a point if I'm wrong.

Question:
Which architect built the Palace of Running Water in Buenos Aires?
----------
  A: Alejandro Bustillo
  B: Francisco Tamburini
  C: Carlos Nyströmer
  D: Eduardo Le Monnier

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about the Palace of Running Water (Palacio de Aguas Corrientes) in Buenos Aires and its architect.

The Palace of Running Water (Palacio de Aguas Corrientes) is a famous building in Buenos Aires. From my knowledge, this ornate water pumping station was designed by Swedish-Argentine engineer Carlos Nyströmer in the late 19th century. The building is known for its elaborate facade with terracotta decorations.

I'm reasonably confident that the answer is C: Carlos Nyströmer.

Question:
What was the first and last name of the Swiss painter who murdered his landlady, Anne King?
----------
  A: François Lemoyne
  B: Théodore Gardelle
  C: Jean-Baptiste Greuze
  D: Antoine Watteau
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about this specific historical crime case.

This question asks about a Swiss painter who murdered his landlady Anne King. The name "Théodore Gardelle" appears in option B, and this does ring true as a historical case from 18th century London where a Swiss painter named Théodore Gardelle murdered his landlady Anne King in 1761.

However, this is quite obscure historical knowledge, and I need to be confident enough to risk losing a point if I'm wrong. The specificity of the details (Swiss painter, landlady named Anne King) and my recognition of Gardelle's name in this context gives me reasonable confidence.

The other options are all legitimate French painters from roughly the same era, which makes this a plausible distractor set, but none of them are associated with this particular crime.

I believe I have sufficient confidence to answer this question.

In which Community episode is Evil Abed's first appearance? Please give the season, episode number, and title.
----------
  A: Season 2 Episode 14 "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons"
  B: Season 3 Episode 4 "Remedial Chaos Theory"
  C: Season 4 Episode 11 "Basic Human Anatomy"
  D: Season 3 Episode 22 "Introduction to Finality"
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider whether I can confidently answer this question about the TV show "Community" and Evil Abed's first appearance.

Evil Abed is a memorable character from Community who appears in the darkest timeline. His first appearance is in "Remedial Chaos Theory" (Season 3, Episode 4), which is the famous episode about multiple timelines where rolling a die creates different scenarios. In one timeline, things go badly and Abed puts on a felt goatee, becoming "Evil Abed."

I'm confident that the answer is B: Season 3 Episode 4 "Remedial Chaos Theory"

----------
  A: Lyudmila Karachkina

  D: Nikolai Chernykh
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about this question.

This question asks about a minor planet named after Viktor Vasnetsov (a Russian artist) and who discovered it. This is very specific astronomical/historical knowledge about minor planet discoveries.

While I have some general knowledge about astronomers and minor planets, I don't have confident, specific knowledge about which minor planet was named after Viktor Vasnetsov or who discovered it. The options listed are all Soviet/Russian astronomers who discovered minor planets, but I cannot reliably determine which one discovered this specific minor planet.

Given the specificity of this question and my uncertainty about the correct answer, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

  D: Dustin Pedroia
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about this specific baseball question.

This question asks about a very specific play in Game 1 of the 2007 World Series (inning 4, who hit a double that scored two runs). This is an extremely detailed historical sports question that requires precise knowledge of a specific game from 2007.

While I have some general knowledge about the 2007 World Series (Boston Red Sox vs Colorado Rockies, Red Sox won), I don't have confident, reliable knowledge about the specific play-by-play details of individual innings. This level of specificity about who hit what in which inning is the kind of detail where I could easily be wrong.

Given that:
- Wrong answer = -1 point
- Pass = 0 points
- I'm not confident about this specific detail

The risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the band Immature.

Immature (later known as IMx) was an R&B boy band from the 1990s. I recall that the group had some member changes, but I'm not entirely certain about the specific details of who replaced Don Santos or when this occurred.

Looking at the options:
- The names have stage names in quotes that seem to follow a pattern
- I know Marques "Batman" Houston was a member of Immature
- Kelton "LDB" Kessee was also a member

However, I'm not confident enough about the specific replacement of Don Santos to risk losing a point. This is a very specific factual question about band member history that I could easily get wrong.

  B: Viljoen
  C: De Klerk
  D: Botha

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to identify which former President of South Africa died on January 4, 2007, and received a state funeral.

Let me think through the options:
- Mbeki (Thabo Mbeki) - was president from 1999-2008, still alive at that time
- Viljoen (Constand Viljoen) - military figure and politician, but not a president
- De Klerk (F.W. de Klerk) - was president 1989-1994, died in 2021
- Botha (P.W. Botha) - was president 1984-1989, died on October 31, 2006

Wait, P.W. Botha died in October 2006, not January 2007. Let me reconsider...

Actually, I'm not entirely certain about the exact date. The question asks for someone who died on January 4, 2007. I'm not confident enough in my knowledge of this specific date to risk losing a point.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about this specific question regarding Buenos Aires Subway station history.

This is a very specific factual question about the historical name of a Buenos Aires Subway station. The Carlos Gardel station is named after the famous tango singer, but I'm not certain about what its original name was before being renamed. This is quite specialized local transit history knowledge.

While I have some general knowledge about Buenos Aires, I don't have high confidence in knowing the specific original name of this particular station. Getting this wrong would cost me a point, while passing costs me nothing.

Given the specialized nature of this question and my uncertainty, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

What is the name of the Japanese scientist who received the Shaw Prize in 2008?

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider whether I can confidently answer this question about the Shaw Prize in 2008.

The Shaw Prize is awarded in three categories: Astronomy, Life Science and Medicine, and Mathematical Sciences. In 2008, there were multiple laureates across these categories.

Looking at the options:
- Takaaki Kajita - Known for neutrino physics, won Nobel Prize in 2015
- Shinya Yamanaka - Known for induced pluripotent stem cells, won Nobel Prize in 2012
- Makoto Kobayashi - Particle physicist, won Nobel Prize in 2008
- Satoshi Ōmura - Microbiologist, won Nobel Prize in 2015

I'm not entirely certain which of these scientists received the Shaw Prize specifically in 2008, as opposed to other prestigious awards. This is a very specific factual question about a particular year and award, and I could easily confuse it with Nobel Prize winners or other years.

Given the risk of losing a point if I'm wrong, and my uncertainty about this specific detail, I should pass.

Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to determine whether I should answer this question about when Doris Salcedo received the Rolf Schock Prize in Visual Arts.

Let me consider what I know: Doris Salcedo is a Colombian visual artist known for her sculpture and installation work. The Rolf Schock Prizes are prestigious awards given in several categories including Visual Arts.

I'm not entirely certain of the exact year she received this prize. This is a very specific factual question about a particular award and year. Without being confident in the answer, guessing would be risky since I lose a point for being wrong.

Given the uncertainty and the specific nature of this question, the strategic choice is to pass rather than risk losing a point.

Question:
What was the name of the first principal of Tyndale Biscoe School in Srinagar, Kashmir?
----------
  A: Reverend J.H.Knowles
  B: Reverend W.S. Biscoe
  C: Reverend A.R. Mitchell
  D: Reverend C.E. Tyndale
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I should answer this question about the first principal of Tyndale Biscoe School in Srinagar, Kashmir.

This is a very specific historical question about a particular school in Kashmir. The school's name includes "Tyndale Biscoe," which suggests the answer might be related to those names. However, I'm not certain about the specific historical details of who was the *first* principal versus who the school was named after.

Given that:
- This is highly specific historical information
- I'm not confident about the distinction between the school's namesake and its first principal
- Getting it wrong would cost me a point
- The risk outweighs the potential reward

The Discordian calendar (also known as the YOLD - Year of Our Lady of Discord) adds 1166 years to the Gregorian calendar year. So 2024 + 1166 = 3190 YOLD.

Looking at the options, C is 3190 YOLD, which matches my calculation.

I'm confident in this answer, so I should choose to answer.

The Order of the Liberator General San Martín is an Argentine decoration, one of the highest honors in Argentina. However, I don't have confident, specific knowledge about which sculptor designed this particular order from among these four options with Spanish names.

This is a very specific historical/biographical question about a particular honor's designer, and I cannot reliably distinguish between these options. Getting this wrong would cost me a point.

Question:
What was the first band Robbie Robertson joined that formed in '56?
----------
  A: The Suedes and the Crowns
  B: The Hawks and the Rebels
  C: Little Caesar and the Consuls
  D: Johnny and the Hurricanes
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider what I know about Robbie Robertson's early career.

Robbie Robertson is famous for being in The Band, but before that, he had earlier musical ventures. The question asks about a band he joined that formed in 1956, when he would have been quite young (born in 1943, so he'd be about 13 years old in 1956).

Looking at the options:
- The Suedes is mentioned, which I believe was one of his very early groups
- The Hawks became Levon and the Hawks, which later evolved into The Band
- I'm less certain about the other options

However, I'm not completely certain about which specific band formed in '56 that he first joined. This is a very specific historical detail about his early career, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given the uncertainty about this specific detail and date, I should pass.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about the architect of the Palace of Justice of the Argentine Nation.

This is a very specific question about Argentine architecture. The Palace of Justice (Palacio de Justicia) in Buenos Aires is an important building, but I'm not certain about which architect designed it from these options. All four names appear to be architects who worked in Argentina during the late 19th/early 20th century, but I don't have strong confidence in identifying the correct one.

Given the risk of losing a point if I'm wrong versus gaining nothing by passing, and my lack of confidence in this specific architectural history question, I should pass.

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about the American Chemical Society Award in Pure Chemistry recipient in 1937.

This is a very specific historical fact about a scientific award from 1937. While I have some knowledge of prominent chemists from that era (all four options are notable scientists), pinpointing the exact year someone received a specific award is quite difficult without being certain.

Given the specificity of the year and award, and the risk of losing a point if wrong, I should be conservative here.

Question:
What is the chemical name of the drug previously known to treat bacterial infections that Dr. William Schwartz discovered also acts as a diuretic in people with congestive heart failure?
----------
  A: Sulfanilamide.
  B: Penicillin
  C: Streptomycin
  D: Chloramphenicol
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I can confidently answer this question about medical history.

This question asks about Dr. William Schwartz's discovery that a bacterial infection treatment also acts as a diuretic for congestive heart failure patients.

The key historical fact here relates to sulfonamide drugs (sulfa drugs). Sulfanilamide was indeed discovered to have diuretic properties, which led to the development of modern diuretic medications. This discovery was made when researchers noticed that sulfonamide antibiotics had effects on fluid balance.

The other options:
- Penicillin: primarily an antibiotic, not known for diuretic discovery
- Streptomycin: an antibiotic for tuberculosis
- Chloramphenicol: a broad-spectrum antibiotic

The answer appears to be A: Sulfanilamide, as sulfonamides were the drugs that led to the discovery and development of diuretic therapy.

I'm reasonably confident about this answer based on medical history.

  C: Dagar Vani Gayaki Ustad Nasir Moinuddin
  D: Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to determine whether I should answer this question about the first Indian musician to perform at the UN General Assembly in 1966.

This is a specific historical fact about Indian classical music. M.S. Subbulakshmi (option A) is indeed famous for being the first Indian musician to perform at the United Nations General Assembly in 1966. She was a renowned Carnatic vocalist and this performance was a historic milestone. This is a well-documented fact in Indian music history.

I'm confident in this answer.

------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I have reliable knowledge about Richard Neutra's Elkay Apartments and who commissioned them.

Richard Neutra was a prominent modernist architect, and I'm familiar with some of his major works. However, the "Elkay Apartments" is not one of his most famous projects that I can confidently recall details about. 

I know that:
- Philip Lovell commissioned the famous Lovell Health House
- Edgar Kaufmann is associated with Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater
- I'm less certain about the Elkay Apartments specifically

Given the uncertainty about this specific project and client, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Which school did Lyndon B. Johnson briefly teach in Pearsall?
----------

Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider what I know about Lyndon B. Johnson's teaching career.

LBJ did teach at a school early in his career, and this is a well-documented part of his biography. However, the question asks specifically about a school in Pearsall, Texas. I know he taught at Welhausen Elementary School, but I believe that was in Cotulla, Texas, not Pearsall. 

The question is asking about Pearsall specifically, and I'm not confident about which school in Pearsall he taught at, or if he even taught in Pearsall at all. This seems like a very specific historical detail that I'm uncertain about.

Given the uncertainty and the risk of losing a point, I should pass on this question.

The options given include what appear to be legitimate album titles from the band, but pinpointing the exact year requires precise knowledge.

Given the uncertainty and the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the safe option of passing (0 points), I should pass on this question.

- The Suru River is a tributary in the Kargil region of Ladakh (formerly part of Jammu and Kashmir)
- Chutak Hydroelectric Plant is known to be located in the Kargil district

The Chutak Hydroelectric Plant is indeed located on the Suru River in the Kargil district. This is a relatively well-documented project.

Dick Drago was an American relief pitcher who played in Major League Baseball. However, I'm not certain about the specific age at which he died. This is a very specific factual question about a relatively lesser-known baseball player's biographical details, and I don't have confident knowledge of this information.

Given the penalty for wrong answers (-1 point) versus the reward for correct answers (+1 point), and my uncertainty about this specific fact, the expected value of answering is negative.

Question:
In what major painting exhibition did artist J.C. Leyendecker earn a spot in 1897?
----------
  A: The Salon Champs de Mars
  B: The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition
  C: The Paris Salon
  D: The Venice Biennale
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate my confidence in answering this question about J.C. Leyendecker's 1897 exhibition.

J.C. Leyendecker was an American illustrator who studied in Paris in the 1890s. In 1897, he would have been studying at the Académie Julian in Paris. The most prestigious exhibition for a young artist in Paris at that time would have been the Paris Salon.

However, I'm not entirely certain about the specific exhibition in 1897. While the Paris Salon seems most likely given his location and the time period, I don't have definitive knowledge of this particular fact.

Given the uncertainty and the risk of losing a point, I should pass on this question.

Question:
What was the Word of the Decade (2010–2019) according to the American Dialect Society?
----------
  A: them
  B: we
  C: they
  D: me
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to consider whether I'm confident enough about this answer to risk losing a point if I'm wrong.

The American Dialect Society's Word of the Decade for 2010-2019 was related to the singular "they" pronoun, which gained significant prominence during that decade as a gender-neutral singular pronoun. Looking at the options, "they" (option C) fits this context.

However, I should be careful - the question asks specifically about "Word of the Decade" and option A is "them," which is also part of the they/them pronoun set. I believe the actual word chosen was "they" as the singular pronoun, but there's some uncertainty here.

Given that I have reasonable confidence this is about the singular they/them pronouns and "they" is among the options, I'll answer.

Question:
What day, month, and year did the head of the Turkish Red Crescent, who was accused of selling tents to earthquake survivors, resign?
----------
  A: 8 April 2023
  B: 15 March 2023
  C: 27 February 2023
  D: 12 May 2023
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Answer, 2=Pass; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about this specific event.

This question asks about a specific resignation date of the head of the Turkish Red Crescent following accusations related to selling tents to earthquake survivors. This appears to reference events following the devastating earthquakes in Turkey in February 2023.

While I have some knowledge about the Turkey-Syria earthquakes of February 2023 and subsequent controversies, I'm not confident about the specific resignation date of the Turkish Red Crescent head. This is a very specific factual detail that requires precise knowledge, and getting it wrong would cost me a point.

Given the uncertainty and the specific nature of the date required, the risk of losing a point outweighs the potential gain.

Question:
What trophy was won on October 12, 2019, by Kaizer Chiefs Football Club?
----------
  A: The Telkom Knockout Cup
  B: The Nedbank Cup
  C: The Shell Ultra Helix Cup.
  D: The MTN 8 Cup
------------------------------
Respond ONLY with '1' or '2'.
Your choice (1 or 2): 1=Pass, 2=Answer; response: ||I need to evaluate whether I have reliable knowledge about this specific sporting event.

This question asks about a specific trophy won by Kaizer Chiefs Football Club on a specific date (October 12, 2019). This is a very precise factual question about South African football.

While I have some general knowledge about South African football competitions, I'm not confident about the specific date of October 12, 2019, and which trophy Kaizer Chiefs won on that exact date. This level of specificity about a particular match date and trophy requires precise knowledge that I'm uncertain about.

Given the risk of losing a point if I'm wrong versus gaining nothing by passing, and my uncertainty about this specific detail, the prudent choice is to pass.
