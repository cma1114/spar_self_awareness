        "question": "Children are quick to ask \"why\" and \"how'' when it comes to new things, but research suggests that they learn more when teachers turn the questions back on them. \"When children explain events, they learn more than when just getting the results,'' said Cristine H. Legare, a professor at the University of Texas. Ms. Legare brought in 96 children aged 3 to 5 and set before them a complex toy made up of colorful, interlocking gears  . With the first group, the researchers asked, \"Can you explain this to me?\" With the second one, they said, \"Look, isn't this interesting?'' The two groups of children focused on different things, researchers found. Children who were asked to observe noticed the colors of the toy, while those asked to explain focused on the chain of gears working on each other. Children who had explained the toy were better at re-creating it and not being disturbed by decorative gears, and they were better able to use what they had learned who had observed the toy outperformed the children in the explanation group on a memory task focused on the toy's colors. Dedre Gentner, the director of the cognitive science program at Northwestern University, said that teachers introducing a concept can improve students' understanding  by  giving examples of close comparisons,  and then asking children to explain how concepts are related. In a series of experiments with 3-to 7-year-olds, she focus children can be con be confused by comparisons that focus on a relationship rather than a direct-object match. For example, a 3-year-old shown a picture of two rabbits facing each other and told \"this is a toma '' and then asked to find another \"tome\" will choose a picture of a rabbit over one of two cats facing each other 98 percent of the time. A 7-year-old is more likely to recognize the more abstract comparison of a relationship. However, Ms. Gentner found that 3-year-olds can think more like 7-yesr-olds if they are given more examples. When shown a \"toma\" with rabbits and another with cats, and then asked, \"Can you say why both of these are tomas?\" most of the children can give a good explanation.

        "question": "A predator  kills and eats other animals as prey .Sometimes it also becomes food for other predators. Polar bears are the largest of all the land predators. They can run across snow and swim in icy water for hours without rest. Their favorite food is seal. Not all big animals live on small animals. Hippos have heavy bodies and huge mouths. But they don't eat animals. They just eat grass. Some predators use speed to catch their prey. Cheetahs are the fastest animals on land. They can run up to 70km an hour. Other predators use their senses to find their food. Sharks can see, smell, hear, feel and taste. They can also sense electrical currents( )from other animals' bodies. Some fish try to hide themselves, but with this sixth sense, sharks can always find them. Sharks have smooth bodies. This helps them swim without using lots of energy. They need to save their energy because they never really sleep and never stop hunting. Flying is a useful skill for many predators in the sky. The butcher bird is the most interesting predator. It has a special way of eating its prey. First it kills its prey. Then it hangs it on a fence or in a tree, just like a butcher hangs meat in his shop. Finally, it eats its prey. Some people hunt and kill more animals than any other predator. They not only hunt for food. They also hunt for fun. They kill sharks for their fins, and tigers for skins.

There were always seven. At the bottom, he jumped over his dog Lucky who was licking himself clean. Timmy took a bite of toast and a sip of the orange juice his mom Suzie had left on the table for him before running outside to check the mail. Before he made it down the steps, he almost tripped on a big package waiting for him. It was here! Timmy's birthday present from his grandmother Betty had arrived. He brought it into the kitchen, where his dad Ryan was waiting for him with a grin on his face. As Timmy tore into the package, he found the greatest present he could have asked for. It was a huge water gun! Timmy immediately filled it up and ran outside to begin playing. His neighbor Maeby came outside with her water hose after eating her sandwich and the two got in a water fight! Soon, Timmy's dad came outside to play too! He brought 11 water balloons. Soon all five of Timmy's friends were playing in the water with each other. Timmy's water gun was the best toy out there. It worked by winding up the handle before firing the water. Soon it was evening and Timmy's dad was firing up the grill to cook hotdogs and hamburgers for Timmy's friends and their families. How many steps did Timmy run down?",

        "question": "Do you like to sit in front of the computer and play computer games hour after hour? Have you ever thought of what that may be doing to your health? More and more children are becoming overweight  and growing less creative because they spend too much time in front of the computer according to a survey. Last week Child Protective Services in America organized an activity. The aim of the activity was to encourage children to do some outdoor activities instead of playing computer games at home. Many American children spend about 1,000 hours a year playing computer games -- more time than they spend in school. As a result, they are overweight. Some of them have very poor _ , and they can't see clearly. Everyone should pay attention to his health and try to keep healthy. The doctor says that the longer children play computer games, the more overweight they may become. And the junk food children eat while they're playing computer games makes the weight problem more serious. To keep fit, children need to take exercise regularly, play outside with friends, and explore the world around them. Can you spend two weeks without playing computer games? It might be difficult for computer lovers, but why not have a try? Children may become  _   if they play computer games all day.",

        "question": "If there's a child in your house who likes pixies  , nature, or magic, Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure is sure to be a hit. This beautifully animated film   is a first class production in every way, and features the familiar voices of Kristin Chenoweth, Anjelica Huston, Jane Horrocks, Lucy Liu, and Raven Symone. The movie offers up an adventure that's easy enough to follow, but complex enough to hold one's attention, and even throws in a nice little moral about friendship. What can I say? I'm pleasantly surprised.                                    The up-and-coming Mae Whitman voices Tinker Bell herself, a far more dynamic character than we met in Peter Pan. Though Tinker still possesses her fiery temper, it doesn't manifest itself immediately, and takes a backseat to this pixie's many good qualities. As it turns out, Tinker Bell is extremely skilled at tinkering , so she is a natural choice to build a special scepter , for Pixie Hollow's Autumn Celebration. The scepter will hold the moonstone through which the light of the Blue Moon will pass, supplying Pixie Hollow with enough pixie dust for the year ahead.      For days, Tinkers works hard on the perfect scepter design while her good friend Terrence does his best to assist. When Terrence accidentally breaks the Moon Stone, Tinker Bell \"explodes\" and sends him away. One of Tinker's more literal friends finds this extremely concerning, as she doesn't quite understand that the outburst was emotional rather than physical ----- very funny indeed.      After hearing the legend of the lost treasure, Tinker Bell strikes out on her own to find a new Moon Stone. She faces many difficulties and meets new friends along the way, but when Terrence comes to the rescue at Tinker's darkest hour, she realizes the value of a truly loyal friend. Though the film is engaging and offers a positive message to young viewers, it's the animation that makes Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure stand out. Pixie Hollow is a charming, visually stunning world basked in lush color1s. It's so lovely, so detailed, so three-dimensional that you almost want to step inside.

        "question": "Historians usually just study great things that happened in the past time, but Drew Faust has made history! On February 11, 2007, Faust was named president of Harvard University.She is the first woman to hold the position in the school's 371-year history. \"I am a historian,\" she said.\"I've spent a lot of time thinking about the past, and about how it shapes the future.No university in the country, perhaps the world, has as remarkable a past as Harvard's.\" \"And our common enterprise is to make Harvard's future even more remarkable than its past.That will mean recognizing and building on what we already do well.It will also mean recognizing what we don't do as well as we should, and not being satisfied until we find ways to do better.\" It is her great desire for improvement and willingness to try out new ideas that have given Drew success in a world controlled by men.\"This is a man's world, my girl, and the sooner you learn that, the better off you'll be.\" Drew Faust recalls her mother telling her this when she was young, but she didn't _ it. Faust grew up in a well-off family in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley in the 1950s.Even then, she was a trailblazer .A conversation with her family's black handyman   and driver inspired her to write a letter, on school notebook paper, to President Dwight Eisenhower. She asked that he help bring US citizens together in the south, a much divided part of the country at the time. \"Drew Faust is a historian with her eyes on the future,\" said Susan Graham, a professor of Harvard.Many of the university's schools said that they believe Harvard will have a brighter future under the leadership of Drew Faust.

        "question": "Ask anyone what is the most difficult part of changing their lifestyle habits and they are most likely to say, \"Staying motivated.\" But a 36-year-old professor from Carnegie Mellon University claims it may have the answer in the form of robot weight loss coach that dishes out daily health advice and encouragement. Autom is the work of Intuitive Automata, a company based in Sha Tin which claims to be a pioneer in commercial socially-interactive robots. The robot, which stands around 38 centimeters tall, has a head that swivels  , blue eyes, and a touch screen which allows the user to input information daily about exercise and diet Its creators say Autom will have a daily conversation with its user lasting up to five minutes, giving feedback and encouragement.Over time, it will interact more with the user as it gathers more information about them. Cory Krdd, a research team manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency claims research has shown that people find robots a more reliable source of information than on-screen-based character. In a controlled study in Pittsburgh City Council, 15 dieters were given Autom for six weeks. Another 15 received a touch-screen computer with identical software and 15 were given a paper log.The study found, people using the robot are more likely to stick with their diets longer, in fact twice as long as those using just a paper log. \"While not one person among the computer or paper groups continued past six weeks, most who had Autom did not want to give her back at the conclusion of the study,\" he said. The bottom line is that a robot creates a more powerful and long-lasting relationship with the user than a character on the screen. Autom is expected to go on sale later this year in the United States for around $500.A robot which speaks and understands Cantonese and Mandarin in addition to English according to the demands is also being developed.

        "question": "Death is natural, but do you have any idea of the process of dying? Modern scientists divide the process of dying into two phases --- clinical or temporary death and biological death. Clinical death occurs when the vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, have ceased to function, but have not suffered permanent damage. The organism can still be revived . Biological death occurs when changes in the organism lead to the \"breaking up\" of vital cells and tissues. Death is then unchangeable and final. Scientists have been seeking a way to prolong the period of clinical death so that the organism can remain alive before biological death occurs. The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism, combined with narcotic sleep. By slowing down the body's metabolism , cooling delays the processes leading to biological death. To illustrate how this works, scientists performed an experiment on a six-year-old female monkey called Keta. The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic. Then they surrounded her body with ice-bags and began checking her body temperature. When it had dropped to 28 degrees the scientists began draining blood from an artery. The monkey's blood pressure decreased and an hour later both the heart and breathing stopped: clinical death set in. For twenty minutes Keta remained in this state. Her temperature dropped to 22 degrees. At this point the scientists pumped blood into an artery in the direction of the heart and started artificial breathing. After two minutes Keta's heart became active once more. After fifteen minutes, spontaneous breathing began, and after four hours Keta opened her eyes and lifted her head. After six hours, when the scientists tried to give her a penicillin injection, Keta seized the syringe and ran with it around the room. Her behavior differed little from that of a healthy animal. All of the following indicate that the monkey has almost restored to her original physical state except the fact that",

        "question": "More than 2,400 years ago, a sickness struck Athens. The disease is said to have killed up to one third of all Athenians, including their leader Pericles. The huge loss of life  helped to change the balance of power between Athens and its enemy, Sparta, in the ancient world. Historians say the sickness began in what is now Ethiopia. They say it passed through Egypt and Libya before it entered Greece. Knowledge of the disease has come mainly from the writings of the ancient Greek historian Thucydides, who survived it. So what caused the fall of Athens? Now, a study based on genetic  testing says it was probably typhoid   fever.  Greek researchers announced the results. Journal of Infectious Diseases published the findings online last week. Researchers from the University of Athens tested human remains from an ancient burial place in the Greek capital. The researchers collected genetic material from teeth. They say tests found genetic evidence similar to that of the modern-day Salmonella  . Manolis Papagrigorakis led the University of Athens team. He says the findings throw light on one of the most debated mysteries in medical history. Typhoid fever is a life-threatening disease that is common today in developing countries. Experts say there are more than 21,000,000 cases each year.  Typhoid can be spread by food or drink that has been handled by a person infected with the bacteria  that causes it. Bacteria in human waste can pollute water supplies. So water used for drinking or to wash food can also spread the infection. Hand washing is important to reducing the spread of typhoid. And there are vaccines   that can help prevent it. Some people recover but continue to carry the bacteria. These carriers can get sick again. And they may continue to infect others. Doctors can do tests to make sure the bacteria has left the body. What might be the right route of typhoid spreading?",

        "question": "In the very early 1800's, a young boy about 14 years old named John lived in a orphanage  in Old England along with several other children. Orphan meant unwanted and unloved. Christmas was the one day of the year when the children didn't work and received a gift, an orange. Usually they tried to taste and keep it for so long that it often went bad before they ever peeled it to enjoy the sweet juice. Many thoughts were expressed as Christmas time drew near. The children would say, \"I will keep mine the longest.\" John usually slept with his next to his pillow. This year John was overjoyed by the Christmas season. He was becoming a man and stronger and soon he would be old enough to leave. He would save his orange until his birthday in July. Christmas day finally came. The children were so excited as they entered the big dinning hall. Immediately the master shouted, \"John, leave the hall and there will be no orange for you this year.\" John's heart broke violently wide open. He turned and went quickly back to the cold room. Then he heard the door open and each of the children entered. Little Elizabeth with her hair falling over her shoulders, a smile on her face, and tears in her eyes held out a piece of rag to John. \"Here John,\" she said, \"this is for you.\" As he lifted back the edges of the rag he saw a big juicy orange all peeled and quartered  and then he realized what they had done. John never forgot the sharing, love and personal sacrifice  his friends had shown him that Christmas day. In memory of that day every year he would send oranges all over the world to children everywhere. According to Paragraph 2, what would overjoy John most the next year?",

        "question": "We all like watching online videos of dogs and cats doing funny things. But if you had to decide, which of the two animals would you say you might like better? Your answer may say something about your personality. According to a 2010 study led by Sam Gosling, a scientist at the University of Texas, US, dog people are about 15 percent more outgoing and 13 percent more pleasant to be friends with than cat people. This is not hard to understand, since cats and dogs behave differently themselves. \"Cats will occasionally _ social activities, but usually after only a few minutes, they will abandon the game. Dogs, on the other hand, will often engage in play, like fetching a thrown ball, for hours at a time,\" said Modern Dog Magazine. Although cat people are less social, Gosling's study showed that they are 11 percent more open-minded than dog people. They usually like art, adventures and unusual ideas. They also have more imagination and curiosity. But dog people are more likely to stick to old beliefs and traditional interests. However, their love of a free lifestyle also means that cat people dislike making plans. They just follow whatever ideas pop into their heads without planning ahead. But dog people are different. They usually have strong self-control and like to carry out their plans. Despite these big differences between dog people and cat people, there are some things that they have in common, \"Both types of people consider themselves close to nature, dislike animal-print clothing, and are generally optimists,\" noted Mother Nature Network. But can personality change? Can a cat person become a dog person, or the other way around? In a study done by Stanley Coren, a scientist based in Canada, he asked cat owners: \"If you had enough living space and there were no objections form other people in your life, and someone gave you a puppy as a gift, would you keep it?\" About 68 percent of them said they would not accept a dog as a pet. But when dog owners were asked the same question about a kitten, almost 70 percent said they would allow a cat into their lives. What do cat people and dog people have in common?",

        "question": "James Dean was not very tall-he was less than average height. He had thick, light brown hair and blue eyes. He was so near-sighted that he could hardly see anything without his glasses.      He came to Hollywood when he was eighteen, hoping to get into the movies. At first, he was not successful at all, and for a time he was so short of money that he had to live entirely on dry oatmeal. Then he went to New York. He got a part in a play and was seen by the great director Elia Kazan. Kazan was planning the movie East of Eden and realized Dean would be perfect for one of the main roles.      By this time, Dean already had a reputation for being odd and difficult to work with. He then went back to Hollywood to make East of Eden and then made two more movies, Rebel Withhout a Cause and Giant. He almost always wore the same overcoat and jeans and he had hardly any friends at all. \"If he didn't like you, he wouldn't even give you the pleasure of his anger. You could be in the same telephone booth with him, but you wouldn't exist,\" someone who knew him said later.      In spite of his poor eyesight, he loved driving fast motorcycles and even faster sports cars. A few days after he finished Giant, on September 25, 1955, Dean went for a drive in his new Porsche. It was evening and the light was poor. Dean was not wearing his glasses. Suddenly, he saw a car in front of him. It was slowing down and trying to turn off the highway. Dean tried to slow down too, but it was  too late. He hit the car at high speed and was killed immediately.      Two German girls killed themselves when they heard the news because \"life would be unbearable without him.\" A few years later, a New York salesclerk wrote a book called Jimmy Dean  Returns in which she claimed that she was in contact with Dean from the other side of the grave. Half  a million copies of the book were sold. It was only the beginning of a strange legend  that goes  on, even today. What does the passage intend to tell us?",

        "question": "The Crouch quadruplets have always been considered quite special but not so special---all four have been accepted into America's Yale University. Dean  at the university, Jeffrey Brenzel, said the admission  for Kenny, Martina, Ray and Carol, all 18-year-old students at Danbury High School in Connecticut , was probably the  first for the university. \"The living memory in the office here shows that we've just had twins, never quadruplets,\" he told the reporters. \"They are all interesting and quite smart in their own way. They are extremely lively kids, very attractive, but clearly four different people. They are all in the top 10 percent of the class.\"     The quadruplets explained to The New York Times how they nervously logged on one by one to the Yale website to discover their fates, First was Ray, who described how the screen suddenly turned Yale blue and displayed the university's bulldog mascot  with the message \"welcome to the Class of 2014\". \"We just kept logging on and screaming, logging on and screaming,' Martina, last to find out, said in an interview with the local television station WINH-TV. Until May 1 they have to decide whether to accept Yale's offers and part of the decision will come down to money, they told the Times.  Their father Steven works as a case manager with the Connecticut mental health department and their mother, Caroline, who originally came from Nigeria, is studying for her master's degree in social work, according to the Times.      Ranked as one of the top three universities in the US after Harvard and Princeton, Yale's school fees each year can be as high as 36,500 dollars, which would land the Crouch family with a very heavy load by the time they graduate in 2014.

        "question": "If you know exactly what you want, the best route to a job is to get specialized training.A recent survey shows that companies like graduates in such fields as business and health care who can go to work immediately with very little on-the-job training. That's especially true of booming fields that are challenging for workers.At Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, for example, bachelor's degree graduates get an average of four or five job offers with salaries ranging from the high teens to the low 20s and plenty of chances for rapid advancement.Large companies, especially, like a background of formal education coupled with work experience. But in the long run, too much specialization doesn't pay off.Business, which has been flooded with MBAs, no longer considers the degree an automatic stamp of approval.The MBA may open doors and command a higher salary initially, _ . As further evidence of the erosion of corporate faith in specialized degrees, Michigan State's Scheetz cites a pattern in corporate hiring practices.Although companies tend to take on specialists as new hires, they often seek out generalists for middle and upper-level management.\"They want someone who isn't constrained by nuts and bolts to look at the big picture, \" says Scheetz. Time and again labor-market analysts mention a need for talents that liberal-arts majors are assumed to have:writing and communication skills, organizational skills, open-mindedness and adaptability, and the ability to analyze and solve problems.David Birch claims he does not hire anybody with an MBA or an engineering degree, \"I hire only liberal-arts people because they have a less-than-canned way of doing things, \" says Birch.Liberal-arts means an academically thorough and strict program that includes literature, history, mathematics, economics, science, human behavior-plus a computer course or two.With that under your belt, you can feel free to specialize.\"A liberal-arts degree coupled with an MBA or some other technical training is a very good combination in the marketplace, \" says Scheetz.

Meet French NGO Telecoms Sans Frontiers (Telecommunications Without Borders  ). Its goal is to use mobile communication technology   to help people in need. TSF began in 1998. First, they opened their main base   in France. Then in 2003, they started another base in Nicaragua. The next year they opened their Thailand base. Now if a disaster hits anywhere in the world, TSF is ready. They can send workers to a disaster area to set up communication systems within 24 hours. Once TSF arrives at a disaster area, they set up telephone connections  and Internet service. They share these services with other international helpers on the scene such as the UN or UNICEF. Mobile communication helps other volunteers do their jobs better. TSF also offers three-minute phone calls to local people who need to contact their loved ones. These communications can allow people to get together again after being separated  . Often the callers are moved to tears after speaking to a relative found to be still alive. Then the families can decide on a safe course of action for their family members. Since 1998, TSF has helped thousands of people in many countries. Most of the TSF workers does not get paid with money, but the satisfaction of helping others and changing lives is often a great reward. How soon can TSF send workers to a disaster area?",

        "question": "Malls are popular places for Americans to go. Some people spend so much time at malls that they are called \"mall rats \". Mall rats shop until they drop in the hundreds of stores. People like malls for many reasons. They feel safe because malls have police stations. Parking is usually free, and the weather inside is always fine. The newest malls have beautiful rest places with waterfalls and large green trees. The largest mall in the United States is the Mall of America in Minnesota. It covers 4. 2 million square feet . It has 350 stores, eight nightclubs, and a large park! There are parking spaces for 12,750 cars. About 750,000 people shop there every week. The first indoor mall in the United States was built in 1965 in Edina Minnesota.

        "question": "WASHINGTON -- President Obama brought together the leaders of Japan and South Korea to discuss cooperation on containing North Korea and its nuclear weapons programs. Japan and North Korea have had tense relations over unresolved issues, some of them dating back 100 years. The three leaders emphasized the importance of cooperation in dealing with North Korea. The meeting took place Tuesday in the Hague, after a twoday nuclear security summit. President Obama praised South Korean President Park Geunhye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for overcoming their differences to discuss a serious threat to regional peace. He emphasized the importance of cooperation on the North Korean nuclear issue. Obama said the three discussed steps to deepen diplomatic  and military cooperation, including joint military exercises and missile  defense against Pyongyang. He said further discussions would take place next month, during his visits to Seoul and Tokyo. The South Korean president stressed the importance of a united response to North Korea, but also called on the North to choose a peaceful path. \"I sincerely hope that this meeting will offer a chance for us to reconfirm our trilateral  coordination and strengthen the cooperation on the nuclear front,\" said Park. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed. \"Particularly it is extremely important that we were able to confirm close cooperation among Japan, the United States and the Republic of Korea on the issue of North Korea, the three countries who would like to cooperate so that North Korea will be able to take a positive position with regard to nuclear and missile issue,\" said Abe. Japan and South Korea have several unresolved issues, including Japan's refusal to apologize again for crimes committed 70 years ago. Former U.S. diplomat  Richard Armitage told an audience this week that painful historic injustices take a long time to heal, and that it is in Japan's interest to continue apologizing for as long as necessary. \"There is a historical record of enormous generosity, achievement and respect for human rights and human freedom,\" said Armitage.

        "question": "MUMBAI - Indian commandos battled into the early hours of Friday to end a multiple hostage crisis in Mumbai after suspected Islamic militants killed 125 people across the city. Officials said they had almost totally cleared the luxury Taj Mahal hotel where gunmen had been held up for more than 24 hours. Indian security forces personnel released hostages from Nariman House in Mumbai.Thirty-nine people were rescued from the five-star Oberoi hotel, where \"mopping up \" operations were still underway, police said. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the militants had come from \"outside the country.\" The Press Trust of India said one Pakistani militant had been arrested, although Pakistan's government fiercely denied any involvement. Indian media reports said between six and nine foreign nationals were among the dead in Mumbai -- including a Japanese businessman, an Australian, a Briton , a German and an Italian. At least five gunmen had been shot dead and one captured, police said.Fourteen security personnel were also killed, including the head of Mumbai's anti-terror squad. To draw maximum international attention, the militants used small groups to attack a total of about a dozen targets in India's financial hub , including the main railway station, a hospital and a restaurant popular with tourists. An unknown group calling itself the Deccan Mujahedeen claimed responsibility, with one gunman telling an Indian TV channel by phone that the outfit was of Indian origin and motivated by the treatment of Indian Muslims. Up to 327 people were reported wounded. The main Bombay Stock Exchange was closed until further notice, as were shops, schools and businesses. Prime Minister Singh said the aim had clearly been to spread panic by choosing high profile targets and \"indiscriminately killing foreigners.\" Witnesses said the gunmen had been very particular in their choice of hotel hostages.\"They said they wanted anyone with British and American passports,\" said one British guest at the Taj Mahal hotel.

        "question": "Many things -- genetics, environment, the food you eat, illness, sleep, even the seasons -- influence your emotional state. But at the heart of it is how you regard yourself. If you have a healthy level of self-esteem, you not only cope with life's challenges better than people with low self-esteem, but you're probably more content, confident, and successful. You're probably also healthier. Studies show that positive self-esteem actually helps inoculate (......) people against depression and anxiety, conditions that may present increased risk of everything from colds to heart diseases.    Most people's good sense of worth is rooted in their childhood -- in the early approval  of their parents, teachers, and friends. But as we get older, most of us judge ourselves by our sense of how effectively we're managing in the world, especially in the areas of love and work. Our ability to love and to be loved can give us a sense of purpose and deep fulfillment. We can also find satisfaction and pride in work-related accomplishments and the people we meet and work with can reinforce our sense of self and our role in life. Once midlife comes along, however, our self-esteem can take a turn in response to changes in our lives. Marital  relationship may change, children may leave home , and we may begin to scale back our work as we approach retirement. Of course, the view in the mirror may not be what it used to be, either.    If you find your self-esteem eroding a bit, try to build it up again. As the saying goes, it's better to try something and fail than to be successful at not trying anything . Focus on goals that are linked to activities you're really interested in, so you'll enjoy a sense of purpose and gain pleasure from the pursuit  whether or not you achieve your goal in full.

        "question": "\"Can I see my baby?\" asked the happy new mother. The bundle was placed in her arms and when she moved the fold of cloth to look upon his tiny face, she held her breath-the baby had been born without ears. Time, however, proved that the baby's hearing was perfect except his appearance. One day when he rushed home from school and threw himself into his mother's arms,. he cried  out bitterly, \"A boy, a big boy ... called me-a f - freak. \" She sighed, knowing that his life was to be endless of heartbreaks. He grew up, handsome for his misfortune. A favorite with his fellow students, he might have been class president but for that. He developed a gift for literature and music. The boy's father had a talk with the family doctor. Could nothing be done? \"I believe we could transplant on a pair of outer ears, if they could be donated , \" the doctor decided. So the search began for a person who would' make such a sacrifice for a young man. Two years went by. Then,  \" You ' re going to the hospital, son. Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need. But it' s a secret.\" said the father. The operation was brilliantly successful. His talents blossomed into genius. School and college became a series of successes. Later he married and entered the diplomatic   service. \"But I must know! \" he urged his father.   \"Who gave so much for me? I could never do enough for him. \" \"I do not believe you could,\" said the father,  \"but the agreement was that you are not to know .... not yet. \" The years kept the secret, but the day did come ... one of the darkest days that ever pass through a son.

        "question": "San Francisco has its cable cars. Seattle has its Space Needle. And, Longview has its squirrel bridge. The bridge, which has attracted international attention, is now a local landmark. The Nutty Narrows Bridge was built in 1963 by a local builder, Amos Peters, to give squirrels a way to cross the busy road without getting flattened by passing cars. The original bridge was built over Olympia Way on the west edge of the library grounds. Before the bridge was built, squirrels had to avoid traffic to and from the Park Plaza office building where office staff put out a nutty feast for the squirrels. Many times, Peters and others who worked in and near Park Plaza witnessed squirrels being run over. One day Peters found a dead squirrel with a nut still in its mouth, and that day's coffee break discussion turned into squirrel safety. The group of businessmen cooked up the squirrel bridge idea and formed a committee to ask the blessing of the City Council .The Council approved, and Councilwoman Bess LaRiviere named the bridge \"Nutty Narrows.\" After architects designed the bridge, Amos Peters and Bill Hutch started Construction, They built the 60-foot bridge from aluminum and lengths of fire hose . It cost 1,000. It didn't take long before reports of squirrels using the bridge started. Squirrels were even seen guiding their young and teaching them the ropes. The story was picked up by the media, and Nutty Narrows became know in newspapers all over the world. In 1983, after 20 years of use, Peters took down the worn-out bridge. Repairs were made and crosspieces were replaced. The faded sign was repainted and in July 1983, hundreds of animal lovers attended the completion ceremony of the new bridge. Peters died in 1984, and a ten-foot wooden squirrel sculpture was placed near the bridge in memory of its builder and his devotion to the project. What happened over the coffee break discussion?",

        "question": "You may know about \" junk food\" like French fries. But do you know about \"junk sleep\"? Recently, a British survey found that electronic  products in teenagers bedrooms are affecting their sleep. The survey was done among 1,000 British kids from 12 to 16. It found that thirty percent of them got just 4 to 7 hours sleep every day. But doctors say they need 8 to 9 hours. Almost a quarter of the kids said they fell asleep more than once a week while watching TV, listening to music or using other electronic products. \"This is very worrying.\" Said Dr Chris Idzikowski, a British expert, \"We call it 'junk sleep', It means you don't get enough sleep and the quality of the sleep is bad, too. If you don't get good rest, you don't perform well in school the next day.\" The survey found that 40 percent of the kids felt tired each day, with girls between 13 and 16 feeling the worst. Nearly all the teenagers have a phone, Mp4 or TV IN THEIR BEDROOM. And many of them have all three. This passage is mainly about  _  .",

        "question": "My aunt died back in about 2003. She was eighty-four and so was my uncle. When she passed he felt miserable. They had been married for over 60 years. After my aunt's death, he attended his church more frequently and his mourning was nearly unbearable to witness. His only daughter lived clear across the country in the south so he had only himself to make a comfort. My cousin talked him into selling the house that he and my aunt had built together about twenty-five years before. It was very hard to part with the home they built together. One day he called my cousin who was living in Texas and told her that he reconnected with a lady from a church that he and my aunt went to forty years previously. She played the piano and his church was looking for new music. Her husband had died about seven years previously. He said he just wanted someone to go out to dinner with and spend time with. We were happy for them but had no idea how it would turn out. They were both almost eighty-seven years old. They were like lovebirds and spent as much time together as they could. They both had one child each, she a son, he a daughter. The conflict in their relationship came one day when they neither wanted to leave their respective churches. Before too long they realized that they did not want to be apart. They would find a new church together. They planned to marry. When he took her to a jewelry store and bought her a diamond, the employees were so impressed that they had a big write up in our own local paper, \"The 'Truth for Valentines' Day. \" They prepared for their wedding. They moved the wedding date up because neither wanted to wait any longer to \"be together\". They got married in her house, where her first marriage took place. It was such a beautiful refreshing thing to see, two people who you would have thought had pretty much lived their lives, were beginning a new one together.

        "question": "For most of the 20th century, Asia asked itself what it could learn from the modern, innovating West. Now the question must be reversed. What can the West's overly indebted and sluggish   nations learn from a flourishing Asia? Just a few decades ago, Asia's two giants were stagnating  under faulty economic ideologies. However, once China began embracing free-market reforms in the 1980s, followed by India in the 1990s, both countries achieved rapid growth. Crucially, as they opened up their markets, they balanced market economy with sensible government direction. As the Indian economist Amartya Sen has wisely said, \"The invisible hand of the market has often relied heavily on the visible hand of government.\" Contrast this middle path with America and Europe, which have each gone ideologically over-board in their own ways. Since the 1980s, America has been increasingly clinging to the ideology of uncontrolled free markets and dismissing the role of government---following Ronald Regan's idea that \"government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. \"Of course, when the markets came crashing down in 2007, it was decisive government intervention that saved the day. Despite this fact, many Americans are still strongly opposed to \"big government.\" If Americans could only free themselves from their antigovernment doctrine(,), they would begin to see that the America's problems are not insoluble. A few sensible federal measures could put the country back on the right path. A simple consumption tax of, say, 5% would significantly reduce the country's huge government deficit  without damaging productivity. A small gasoline tax would help free America from its dependence on oil imports and create motivations for green energy development. In the same way, a significant reduction of wasteful agricultural subsidies could also lower the deficit. But in order to take advantage of these common-sense solutions, Americans will have to put aside their own attachment to the idea of smaller government and less regulation. American politicians will have to develop the courage to follow what is taught in all American public-policy schools: that there are good taxes and bad taxes. Asian countries have embraced this wisdom, and have built sound long-term fiscal   policies as a result. Meanwhile, Europe has fallen prey  to a different ideological trap: the belief that European governments would always have infinite resources and could continue borrowing as if there were no tomorrow. Unlike the Americans, who felt that the markets knew best, the Europeans failed to expect how the markets would react to their endless borrowing. Today, the European Union is creating a $580 billion fund to prevent sovereign collapse. This will buy the EU time, but it will not solve the bloc's larger problem. What has contributed to the rapid economic growth in China and India?",

        "question": "In a room at Texas Children Cancer Center in Houston, eight-year-old Simran Jatar lay in bed with a drip   above her to fight her bone cancer. Over her bald   head, she wore a pink hat that matched her clothes. But the third grader's cheery dressing didn't mask her pain and weary eyes. Then a visitor showed up. \"Do you want to write a song?\" asked Anita Kruse, 49, rolling a cart equipped with an electronic keyboard, a microphone and speakers. Simran stared. \"Have you ever written a poem?\" Anita Kruse continued. \"Well, yes,\" Simran said. Within minutes, Simran was reading her poem into the microphone. \"Some bird soaring through the sky,\" she said softly. \"Imagination in its head...\" Anita Kruse added piano music, a few warbling (, ) birds, and finally the girl's voice. Thirty minutes later, she presented Simran with a CD of her first recorded song. That was the beginning of Anita Kruse's project, Purple Songs Can Fly, one that has helped more than 125 young patients write and record songs. As a composer and pianist who had performed at the hospital, Kruse said that the idea of how she could help \"came in one flash\". The effect on the kids has been great. One teenage girl, curling   in pain in her wheelchair, stood unaided to dance to a hip-hop song she had written. A 12-year-old boy with Hodgkin's disease who rarely spoke surprised his doctors with a song he calledI Can Make It. \"My time with the kids is heartbreaking because of the severity of their illnesses,\" says Anita Kruse. \"But they also make you happy, when the children are smiling, excited to share their CD with their families.\" Simran is now an active sixth grader and cancer-free. From time to time, she and her mother listen to her song,Always Remembering, and they always remember the \"really sweet and nice and loving\" lady who gave them a shining moment in the dark hour.

        "question": "Have you ever wondered why birds sing? Maybe you thought that they were just happy.After all,you probably sing or whistle when you are happy. Some scientists believe that birds do sing some of the time just because they are happy.However,they sing most of the time for a very different reason.Their singing is actually a warning to other birds to stay out of their territory Do you know what a \"territory\" is? A territory is an area that an animal,usually the male,claims as its own.Only he and his family are welcome there.No other families 0f the same species are welcome.Your yard and house are your territory where only your family and friends are welcome.If a stranger should enter your territory and threaten you,you might shout.Probably this would be enough to frighten him away. If so,you have actually scared the stranger away without having to fight him.A bird does the same thing. But he expects an outsider almost any time,especially at nesting  season.So he is screaming all the time,whether he can see an outsider or not This screaming is what we call a bird's song,and it is usually enough to keep an outsider away. Birds sing loudest in the spring when they are trying to attract a mate and warn others not to enter the territory of theirs. You can see that birds have a language all their own.Most of it has to do with attracting mates and setting up territories. What is a bird's \"territory\"?",

The physical book is so elegant that it disappears into the background, and what remains is the author's world. Today, we at Amazon are excited to announce Mindle, a wireless, portable reading device with instant access to more than 90,000 books, magazines and newspapers. We've been working on Mindle for more than three years. Our top design objective was for Mindle to disappear in your hands--to get out of the way--so you can enjoy your reading. We also wanted to go beyond the physical book. Mindle is wireless, so whether you're lying in bed or riding a train, you can think of a book, and have it in less than 60 seconds. No computer is needed--you do your reading directly from the device. We chose the same wireless technology used in advanced mobile phones. But unlike mobile phones, there are no monthly wireless bills, no service or data plans, and no yearly contracts. There is no software to install (,).  We want you to get lost in your reading and not in the technology. Mindle uses a new kind of display called electronic paper. Sharp and natural with no strong light, reading on Mindle is nothing like reading from a computer screen. Mindle weighs only 10.3 ounces--less than paperback--but can carry two hundred books.

He found the pudding and asked for it. \"It's mine! I was the only one who found it!\" I shouted. \"You are my elder brother, You should give it to me!\" said he. Then he started pulling the plate towards himself and I did the same. Suddenly, the plate moved to one side and the pudding slipped   out of the plate. It landed on the floor and turned into a yellow mess. My brother and I both looked at each other, feeling amazed and disappointed at the same time. It was such a waste! To my surprise, Ollie, our pet dog, walked over to the mess on the floor. It began to _ the pudding happily, Within minutes, the mess on the floor was gone. Ollie licked   its lips when it was done. After watching Ollie finishing the whole pudding by itself, we realized  _  . If both of us had shared the pudding, we would both have got to eat half of it.

I served them cocoa and toast with jam to strengthen them against the cold outside. Then I went back to the kitchen and started again on my household. The silence in the front room got me to look inside. The girl held the empty cup in her hands, looking at it. The boy asked in a flat voice, \"Lady, are you rich?\" \"Am I rich? Mercy, no! \" I looked at my shabby sofa. The girl put her cup back in its saucer carefully. \"Your cups match your saucers, she said.\" They left then, holding their bundles of papers against the wind. They hadn't said thank you. They didn't need to. They had done more than that. Plain blue cups and saucers. But they matched. I tasted the potatoes and looked at the meat. Potatoes and meat, the roof over my head, my man with a good steady job - these things matched, too. I moved the chairs back from the fire and tidied the living room.

        "question": "The publication of \"Harry Potterandthe Half-Blood Prince\" gladdens booksellers across China. The British and American editions were No. 1 and No. 3 respectively on the sales chart of the Beijing Xidan Book Building last week. The book's poster is highlighted and news about the book can often be heard on the radio. Why is the book so attractive to children? With curious mood, the author got a copy of \"Harry Potter\". Originally, I wanted to glance over it and made some criticisms. But, out of expectation, the author has been deeply attracted by the magic world. On the other hand, one cannot help asking:  _ Harry Potter\"? The Chinese nation has a history of 5, 000 years, which cannot be regarded as short and its culture as not profound. With a vast market of youngsters, China did publish many books popular among children. However, why are the present works not as good as those imported? There come two major reasons: Firstly, quite a number of children's books are of strong sense of teaching, and lack interest and entertainment. Children often have a feeling of being \"educated\". No wonder they don't like them. Secondly, children's reading materials involving \"idiom stories\" and \"Chinese talents' stories\", though always in different covers, are usually much the same or plagiarized . One knows the ending as early as in the beginning. In final analysis, the authors of the books seldom take children's requirements into consideration. As a matter of fact, each child has his own wonderful imagination. They long to understand the world and nature. Similarly they have their own choices. They dislike similar stories, even if the stories are excellent. First-class reading for children should be very interesting, which contains knowledge and the essence  of national culture, which are presented in children's language. Market is a touchstone for products. The theory also holds true for cultural products. It is hoped that the authors of children's books can learn something from the good market of \"Harry Potter\" and write out more and better books loved by children. What's the feeling of the writer when he finishes reading \"Harry Potter\"?",

        "question": "On the first day of the New Year 2013, I made up my mind to go to Thailand to teach English as a volunteer. Fresh out of college with the world at my fingertips, all I cared about was travelling and seeing the world. Little did I know how awesome my life would be in the coming months! My journey began with the attendance of TESOL certification course in my home state of Florida last February. After 3 weekends of study and another 40 hours' post-study online, I received my TESOL certificate. I was put in touch with Philip, who is Program Director of the Teach in Thailand. In close consultation with Philip, I chose my employment school and after many months of excitement, I finally boarded my plane to Thailand in early April, and set off on an adventure! After a few weeks of single travel, I met up with Philip and the other new teachers in my program in Bangkok. It was great to meet other people who were on the same journey as me, see some cool sights and hang out in Thailand's cities! Directly after that, I attended the week-long seminar  , which is included in the Teach in Thailand Program. At the end of the seminar, I was transported to my employment school---Anuban Buriram Primary School. I truly love my job--- I teach Grades 5 and 6 and I have the cleverest and most motivated kids in the world. It's a truly fantastic thing that you can see the difference you make in someone else's life, right in front of you! The city Buriram is small, surrounded with green rice fields. People here are more friendly than anyone I've ever met--I've never been anywhere where a smile is so easily received, where everyone you pass is so eager to say \"Hello\" and \"Good morning\". I've been taken out to countless dinners, and been lent a guitar, a digital camera, and even a motorbike, and I am constantly given little Thai treats and the most delicious fresh fruits many times a week. I only hope to pay it forward in the future. The author found his teaching in Thailand   _  .",

She stared at him intently. \"Jack, do you remember me?\" Old Jack thought hard and said, \"I think so--I mean you do look familiar.\" \"I was thin and hungry,\" she said. \"Maybe I've _ now more than when you worked here. That was when I was just out of college. I had come to the city looking for a job, but I couldn't find anything. Finally I was down to my last few cents and had been kicked out of my apartment. I walked in the streets for days, cold and hungry. I saw this place and walked in hoping that I could satisfy my hunger.\" Jack lit up with a smile. \"Now I remember,\" he said. \"I was behind the serving counter. You came up and asked me if you could work for something to eat. I said it was against company's policy.\" The woman continued, \"Then you made me the biggest roast beef sandwich, gave me a cup of coffee, and told me to go over to a corner table and enjoy it. I was afraid that you would get into trouble. Then, I saw you put the price of my food in the cash register.\" \"So you started your own business?\" old Jack said. \"I got a job that very afternoon. I worked my way up.

        "question": "When my daughter, Sophie, was admitted to a college we were very happy, but a little worried about becoming empty nesters. I knew I had to do something to help myself adapt, starting with the summer before she left. Sophie had a pack of colorful T-shirts. I knew she wouldn't wear them any more, so I decided to make a quilt out of them for her bed at college. It focused my energy, and also let me relive some memories. I tried to work on the quilt when Sophie wasn't at home----which turned out to be often. She was very busy with her friends. Even when she was around, her door was shut more than usual. I felt a bit hurt. After all, we didn't have much time together before she went to college, I was already missing her, and she hadn't ever left yet. When we arrived at the college, a wave of emotion flooded me. I tried to hold it back, but Sophie saw it in my face. She took a big red book from her bag. \"I made this for you, Mom,\" she said. Then I knew why she had been staying behind a closed door that summer. It was an album of photographs documenting the life of our family over the last 17 years. I broke into tears. Some of it was sadness at having to let her go, but some of it was joy. I knew that our connection was more powerful than ever, and that we'd always be connected by the strongest of threads, the love that went into every stitch of her quilt and every photo of my album. In Sophie's dormitory I unfolded the quilt on her bed. For a moment she was speechless. Then she threw her arms around me. \"Mom, I love you,\" she said. One of her new friends was calling her outside. Sophie turned, and I let her go. Why did the author finally let her daughter go?",

        "question": "The USA, New York--Whales and dolphins are facing increasing threats from climate change, according to a new report published by WWF and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS). The report \"Whales in hot water?\" draws attention to the growing impacts of climate change on whales.They range from changes in sea temperature and the freshening of the seawater because of the melting of ice and increased rainfalls, to a sea level rise, loss of icy polar habitats and the _ of krill populations in key areas.Krill, a tiny shrimp that is dependent on sea ice, is the main source of food for many of the great whales. The speeding up of climate change adds greatly to trouble from other human activities, such as chemical and noise pollution, which kills some 1000 whales every day. \"Whales and dolphins have an ability to adapt to their changing environment,\" said Mark Simmonds, International Director of Science at WDCS.\"But the climate is now changing at such a fast pace that it is unclear to what extent whales and dolphins will be able to adjust.\" Climate change impacts are currently greatest in the Arctic and the Antarctic.According to the report, cetaceans that rely on polar, icy waters for their home and food resources are likely to be greatly affected by the reduction of sea ice cover. WDCS and WWF are urging governments to cut global production of C02 by at least 50 percent by the middle of this century.The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showed it was possible to stop global warming if the world's emissions start to decline before 2015.

He wouldn't go anymore. One night, my wife had a breakdown and shouted at him, \"I tell you, my kid, you might be like this forever.

Even if you are, we love you and we will love you forever!\" My son spoke nothing for two days. He didn't eat or sleep. We could read he was hurt. We hoped something wonderful would fall in our family. On the third morning, he struggled to walk to my car, with his school bag in his hand of course. He raised his head high and hugged me, saying \"I want to go to school. Nothing will beat me.\" You know, from then on, he was never afraid of being mocked or despised anymore. If he couldn't avoid these looks, he chose to look at them in the eyes. Later, something nice really happened and my son went to MIT.

        "question": "How important is color in the business world? Google, one of the biggest U.S. companies, is trying to find it out. The company has already found \"a close connection between color and satisfaction with a person's work area\". That's according to its spokeswoman named Meghan Casserly. \"Color is a silent salesperson,\" said Elyria Kemp. She is an assistant professor of marketing at the University of New Orleans. Kemp is following color trends in business. She is studying the connection between feelings and color. According to Kemp, when people make an evaluation   of a product, usually they do this within 90 seconds or less. Besides, more than half of their first evaluation is based on (......) color alone. That's why so many companies are researching their color choices. They are spending thousands of dollars on the research, too. Just think of UPS's Pullman brown, Home Depot's orange and Tiffany & Co.'s blue. Joclyn Benedetto is a spokeswoman for Tiffany & Co. She said the success of the company's jewelry   was connected to its blue color. It is used to wrap   every product. She said the color was chosen by the founder Charles Lewis Tiffany for the cover of Blue Book, Tiffany's annual collection of beautifully hand-made jewels, which first came out in 1845. Coca-Cola's red color also dates back more than 100 years. The soft drink was shipped in barrels painted red. A spokesperson for Home Depot said research showed that the first thing people thought of was orange when they heard the name of the company. Smaller companies are also realizing the importance of color. But picking the right color is important. \"You know when something is right because you get a feeling of safety, and it's not something that you think about. It just will hit you,\" said Emil Hagopian, a distributor for Mar Plast Color Building Accessories in Ann Arbor, Mich. \"And sometimes, if it's done wrong, that also hits you.\" The passage is mainly about  _  .",

        "question": "In white shirt, blue pants, black cloth shoes and two pigtails, Jingqiu gives off an air of great \"pure beauty\" in Zhang Yimou's new movieUnder the Hawthorn Tree, which tells the story of the sad romance of Jingqiu and a handsome young man named Laosan set at the end of the \"cultural revolution\" (1966-- 1976). Before it was released, moviegoers foresaw what this \"pure beauty\" could be. Director Zhang complained of how long it had taken him to find the right girl for the part of Jingqiu -- a character so innocent. She believes that simply lying on the same bed as a man will make her pregnant. It was 18-year-old Zhou Dongyu who stood out from the crowd. According to Zhang, Zhou has \"eyes that are clear like a fountain on a mountainside\". Born to an ordinary worker's family, the Shijiazhuang girl was in her final year of high school and working hard for a place in an art college. \"If you have fair skin and clear eyes, as Jingqiu does, it is easy to look pure. Girls today wear so many jewels and make-up--that's the reason Zhang was not interested,\" said Du Yanlai, 17, of Chengdu. While some teenagers consider such \"pure\" beauty _ , others believe that it speaks of something soulful. Purity is all about an innocence that shines through from within, thinks 16-year-old Tan Mengxi of Nanjing. \"Being pure can be simple, not having complicated thoughts and being inexperienced. However, it doesn't mean an ignorant or native person. So, a person is pure in his or her nature if he or she is always enthusiastic and able to deal with difficult matters independently. This purity doesn't pass with time, \"she said. The main idea of the passage is   _  .",

        "question": "On October 11, NASCAR announced the car of tomorrow after a seven-year design program. People used to believe that science would promise a future of endless spare time and very cheap electricity. Nowadays the scientists' predictions are a great deal less optimistic: the world is challenged by climate change and decreasing resources. In fact, the car of tomorrow is a symbol of hope. The emission of carbon dioxide has contributed to global warming, but the car producers are waking up to their responsibilities. Investment in new technology to maximize efficiency and minimize environmental damage is not only improving the car industry's act but also setting an example to other industries. It is said that most cars of today run about 15 percent efficiency, which does highlight the potential for improvement. Get it right, and we could continue to enjoy the freedom that comes with owning a car, without the worries. Of course, many advances have already been made. There's evidence that the public is eager to buy cleaner and greener cars. And with petrol prices increasing there is no doubt that the cars with economical, efficient engines are going to be in great demand. The good news is that we can all drive the car of tomorrow today, without having to worry about the purchase cost. By choosing our holiday hired cars wisely we can cut down on our fuel costs and experience an eco-friendly drive. Hire a green car and you'll make a difference to the environment. Designers will always enjoy catching our imagination with \"concept cars\" that look more like miniature  spaceships than anything you see on the highway. Whether these creations will eventually become family cars remains to be seen. However, for the moment, there's no doubt at all what the car of tomorrow will be, and it's here today: something familiar and friendly that does its job with considerably less trouble and much greater efficiency than the car of yesterday. What is the author's attitude towards the cars of tomorrow?",

        "question": "No one knows exactly how many disabled people there are in the world, but estimates suggest the figure is over 450 million. The number of disabled people in India alone is probably more than double the total population of Canada.      In the United Kingdom, about one in ten people have some disability. Disability is not just something that happens to other people: as we get older, many of us will become less mobile, hard of hearing or have failing eyesight.      Disablement can take many forms and occur at any time of life. Some people are born with disabilities. Many others become disabled as they get older. There are many progressive disabling diseases. The longer time goes on, the worse they become. Some people are disabled in accidents. Many others may have a period of disability in the form of a mental illness. All are affected by people's attitude towards them.      Disabled people face many physical barriers. Next time you go shopping or to work or visit friends, imagine how you would manage if you could not get up steps, or on to buses and trains. How would you cope if you could not see where you were going or could not hear the traffic? But there are other barriers: prejudice can be even harder to break down and ignorance inevitably represents by far the greatest barrier of all. It is almost impossible for the able-bodied to fully appreciate what the severely disabled go through, so it is important to draw attention to these barriers and show that it is the individual person and their ability, not their disability, which counts.

        "question": "Peter and his seven-year-old sister ,Kate , were at the same school. Not long after his tenth birthday Peter was entrusted to take her to school. It was only two stops down the road , but the way his parents kept going on about it , you might have thought Peter was taking Kate to the North Pole . He was given instructions the night before. When he woke up , he had to listen to them over and over again. He was to keep hold of Kate's hand at all times , sit close to the front nearest the window , and tell the bus driver the name of his stop. Peter repeated all this back to his mother and set out for the bus stop with his sister. They held hands all the way. Actually he didn't mind this but simply hoped that none of his friends would see him holding a girl's hand. The bus came. They got on and sat close to the front. It was ridiculous sitting there holding hands and there were some boys from school there, so they let go of each other. Peter was feeling proud of himself. He could take care of his sister anywhere. If they were alone tighter on a mountain pass and came face to face with a pack of hungry wolves, he could know exactly what to do. Taking care and not to make sudden movement, he would move away with Kate until they had their backs to a large rock. That way the wolves would not be able to surround them. Then he takes from his pocket two important things--his hunting knife and a box of matches. He takes the knife from its sheath  and sets it down on the grass, ready in case the wolves attack. They're coming close now. They're so hungry and are watering and growling  . Kate is crying, but he cannot comfort her. He knows he has to concentrate on his plan. Right at their feet are some dry leaves and twigs. Quickly and skillfully, Peter gathers them into a small pile. The wolves are edging closer. He has to get this right. There's only one match left in the box. He bends down, cups his hand and lights the match. There's strong rush of wind. The flame flickers, but Peter holds it close to the pile and then first one leaf, then another, then the end of a twig catch fire, and soon the little pile is burning. He piles on more leaves and twigs and larger sticks. The wolves are backing off. Wild animals are terrified of fire. The flames are leaping higher and the wind is carrying the smoke right into their jaws. Now Peter takes holds of the hunting knife and ... Ridiculous! A daydream like this could make him miss his stop if he wasn't careful. The bus had come to a halt. The kids from his school were already getting off. Peter leaped to his feet and just managed to jump to the pavement as the bus was starting off again. It was more than fifty yards down the road when he realized he had forgotten something. Was it his backpack ? No. It was his sister. He had saved her from the wolves and left her sitting there. For a moment, he couldn't move. He stood watching the bus pull away up the road. \"Come back,\" he murmured, \"Come back.\" Before getting on the bus,   _  .",

        "question": "You may think your bathroom is often full of bacteria  and so you give it a complete cleaning once a week. But how often do you clean out and disinfect  your fridge? Well, probably not often enough, according to a recent study, which found out that the fridge is the second dirtiest place in your house, just behind the bathroom. Fridge temperatures were often set too high, allowing the growth of bacteria, which included E.coil, Enterobacteria, and S. aureus, all of which will give you an easy access to food poisoning. So what can you do to ensure your fridge---and your food in it---is not a health threat? For starters, clean the fridge weekly---wipe it and repeat. Make sure your fridge is at the correct temperature for storing food, between 0 and 5 degrees centigrade. Your freezer should be below-18 degrees centigrade. You can use fridge and freezer thermeters to make sure this is the case. Some modern fridges have zones to store different types of food ,such as meat and vegetables. Make sure you don`t store meat in the vegetable zone, as the temperature there might be higher. Make sure you don not leave the door open too long as the temperature in the fridge will quickly rise, creating a breeding  ground for bacteria. Cover food that has not been finished, and eat it within a couple of days. Keep bottles and jars closed. Keep raw meat away from cooked meat. Both should be well covered to prevent pollution. Store raw meat at the bottom of the fridge to stop juices dripping onto other foods. Finally, use common sense, and throw away old food. Which is the best temperature for storing your food in the fridge?",

        "question": "Across the rich world, well-educated people increasingly work longer than the less-skilled. Some 65% of American men aged 62-74 with a professional degree are in the workforce, compared with 32% of men with only a high-school certificate. This gap is part of a deepening divide between the well-education well off and the unskilled poor. Rapid technological advance has raised the incomes of the highly skilled while squeezing those of the unskilled. The consequences, for individual and society, are profound. The world is facing as astonishing rise in the number of old people, and they will live longer than ever before. Over the next 20 years the global population of those aged 65 or more will almost double, from 600 million to 1.1 billion. The experience of the 20th century, when greater longevity translated into more years in retirement rather than more years at work, has persuaded many observers that this shift will lead to slower economic growth, while the swelling ranks of pensioners will create government budget problems. But the notion of a sharp division between the working young and the idle old misses a new trend, the growing gap between the skilled and the unskilled. Employment rates are falling among younger unskilled people, whereas older skilled folk are working longer. The divide is most extreme in America, where well-educated baby-boomers   are putting off retirement while many less-skilled younger people have dropped out of the workforce. That even the better-off must work longer to have a comfortable retirement. But the changing nature of work also plays a big role. Pay has risen sharply for the highly educated, and those people continue to reap rich rewards into old age because these days the educated elderly are more productive than the preceding generation. Technological change may well reinforce that shift: the skills that complement computers, from management knowhow to creativity. Do not necessarily decline with age. What is the result of policy changes in European countries?",

It is important to know the ways you can use and to show them to everyone in the family, such as stairways   and fire escapes, but not lifts . From the lower floors of the building, escaping through windows is possible, learn the best way of leaving through windows with the least chance of serious injury  . The second floor windows are usually not very high from the ground. An average   person, hanging by the finger-tips will have a drop of about six feet to the ground. It is about the height of an average man. Of course, it is safer to jump a short way than to stay in a burning building. Windows are also useful when you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed, or smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may have leaked   into the room. On a second or third floor, the best windows for escaping are those which open onto a roof . From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely, dropping onto stones might end in injury.

        "question": "Today, as I was relaxing at the beach, I couldn't help but eavesdrop(,) on a conversation four high school kids were having on the beach blanket next to me. Their conversation was about making a positive difference in the world. And it went something like this... \"It's impossible to make a difference unless you're a huge company or someone with lots of money and power,\" one of them said. \"Yeah man,\" another replied. \"My mom keeps telling me to move mountains - to speak up and stand up for what I believe. But what I say and do doesn't even get noticed. I just keep answering to 'the man' and then I get slapped back  in place by him when I step out of line.\" \"Repression...\" another snickered. I smiled because I knew exactly how they felt. When I was their age, I was certain I was being repressed and couldn't possibly make a difference in this world. And I actually almost got fired from school once because I openly expressed how repressed  I felt in the middle of the principals' office. I Have A Dream. Suddenly, one of the kids noticed me eavesdropping and smiling. He sat up, looked at me and said, \"What? Do you disagree?\" Then as he waited for a response, the other three kids turned around too. Rather than arguing with them, I took an old receipt out of my wallet , tore it into four pieces, and wrote a different word on each piece. Then I crumbled the pieces into little paper balls and handed a different piece to each one of them. \"Look at the word on the paper I just gave you and don't show it to anyone else.\" The kids looked at the single word I had handed each of them and appeared confused. \"You have two choices,\" I told them. \"If your word inspired you to make a difference in this world, then hold onto it. If not, give it back to me so I can recycle the paper.\" They all returned their words. I walked over quickly , sat down on the sand next to their beach blanket and laid out the four words that the students had returned to me so that the words combined to form the simple sentence,        \"I have a dream.\" \"Dude, that's Martin Luther King Jr.,\" one of the kids said. \"How did you know that?\" I asked. \"Everyone knows Martin Luther King Jr.\" the kid snarled. \"He has his own national holiday, and we all had to memorize his speech in school a few years ago.\" \"Why do you think your teachers had you memorize his speech?\" I asked. \"I don't really care!\" the kid replied. His three friends shook their heads in agreement. \"What does this have to do with us and our situation?\" \"Your teachers asked you to memorize those words, just like thousands of teachers around the world have asked students to memorize those words, because they have inspired millions of repressed people to dream of a better world and take action to make their dreams come true. Do you see where I'm going with this?\" \"Man, I know exactly what you're trying to do and it's not going to work, alright?\" the fourth kid said, who hadn't spoken a word until now. \"We're not going to get all inspired and emotional about something some dude said thirty years ago. Our world is different now. And it's more screwed up than any us can even begin to imagine, and there's little you or I can do about it. We're too small, we're nobody.\" Together I smiled again because I once believed and used to say similar things. Then after holding the smile for a few seconds I said, \"On their own, 'I' or 'have' or 'a' or 'dream' are just words. Not very compelling or inspiring. But when you put them together in a certain order, they create a phrase that has been powerful enough to move millions of people to take action - action that changed laws, perceptions, and lives. You don't need to be inspired or emotional to agree with this, do you?\" The four kids shrugged and struggled to appear totally indifferent, but I could tell they were listening intently. \"And what's true for words is also true for people,\" I continued. \"One person without help from anyone else can't do much to make a big difference in this crazy world - or to overcome all of the various forms of repression that exist today. But when people get together and unite to form something more powerful and meaningful then themselves, the possibilities are endless. Why were the kids repressed?",

Fish that had been fried became soup. Her old shredded   potato turned into diced potato... Feeling strange, dad and I asked Mom the reason for the change. But all she said was, \"Just trying a different taste\". Then she was silent. But it wasn't just her cooking way. Mom also change other habits. After dinner, instead of watching films on TV as usual, she would put on her newly-bought sports clothes and asked Dad to go out for a walk. After they came back home, mom would lose herself in magazines or newspapers about healthcare. Mom almost never gets sick. Why was she suddenly interested in medicine? I couldn't understand her \"abnormal\" behavior. Then one day I came across her micro blog . \"While visiting my parents during the Spring Festival, I suddenly realized that they are in their 70s now,\" my mom had written. \"They move slowly and it is hard for them to do the housework. I should visit them more often... \"Some cooking should be changed to keep them healthy. They like fish soup, diced potato, tender and soft vegetables... \"I must also keep fit by doing physical exercise. If my parents are too weak to move around, I can be strong enough to take care of them. When I am old, my son can also pay less attention to taking care of me...\" When I read this, I felt very sorry. I used to complain that Mom didn't understand me and couldn't give me everything I wanted. I always thought there was a wide gap  between us. But now I completely understand her. How great she is!

        "question": "The Crowne Plaza Hotel in Copenhagen is offering a free meal to any guest who is able to produce electricity for the hotel on an exercise bike linked to a generator  ,The idea is to get people fit and reduce their carbon footprint. Guests will have to produce at least 10 watt hours of electricity -- roughly 15 minutes of cycling for someone of average fitness. Guests staying at Plaza Hotel will be given meat tickets worth $36 once they have produced 10 watt hours of electricity. The bicycles will have smart phones attached to the handlebars measuring how much power is being generated for the hotel. The plan, a world-first, will start on 19 April and run for a year. Only guests staying at the hotel will be able to take part. Frederikke Toemmergaard, hotel spokeswoman, said, \"Many of our visitors are business people who enjoy going to the gym. There might be people who will cycle just to get a free meal, but generally I don't think people will take advantage of our programme,\" Copenhagen has a long-standing cycling tradition and 36% of locals cycle to work each day, one of the highest percentages in the world, according to the website visitcopenhagen.dk. US environmental website treehugger.com recently voted Copenhagen the world's best city for cyclists. \"Because Copenhagen is strongly connected with cycling, we felt the bicycle would work well as a symbol of the hotel's green profile  .\" If successful, the electric bicycle meal programme will be spread to all Crowne Plaza hotels in the UK, the hotel said in a statement.

        "question": "People in the United States honor their parents with two special days:Mother's Day, on the second Sunday in May, and Father's Day, on the third Sunday in June. These days are set aside to show love and respect for parents. They raise their children and educate them to be responsible citizens. They give love and care. These two days make us think about the changing roles of mothers and fathers. More mothers now work outside the home. More fathers must help with child care. These two special days are celebrated in many different ways. On Mother's Day people wear carnations. A red one symbolizes a living mother. A white one shows that the mother is dead. Many people attend religious services to honor parents. It is also a day when people whose parents are dead visit the cemetery .On these days families get together at home, as well as in restaurants. They often have outdoor barbecues for Father's Day. These are days of fun and good feelings and memories. Another tradition is to give cards and gifts. Children make them in school. Many people make their own presents. These are valued more than the ones bought in stores. It is not the value of the gift that is important, but it is \"the thought that counts\". Greeting card stores, florists, candy makers, bakeries, telephone companies, and other stores do a lot of business during these holidays. On Mother's Day and Father's Day,   _  .",

        "question": "New research shows how kids' brains reorganize as they learn math. All the time you spent memorizing multiplication tables may have made you a better mathematician, according to a new study. A team of scientists from Stanford University, in California, have shown how the brain reorganizes itself as kids learn math. After a certain amount of time spent practicing math, kids can put away the calculator . They don't even need to count on their fingers. They simply know the answers to subtraction , addition, and multiplication facts. The quicker kids can recall basic math facts, the easier it is for them to solve more complicated math problems. The Stanford University researchers observed the brain activity of 28 students aged 7to 9 for the study. They took scans of the students' brains as the students solved math calculations without the help of a calculator, pen or paper. A calculation--three plus four equals seven, for example--flashed on a screen. The students pushed a button to say if the answer was right or wrong. The scientists also recorded the response speed, and what parts of the brain became active as the kids pushed the button. These observations showed a process called fact retrieval . Rather than using their fingers to count, or writing out answers on a piece of paper, the students pulled the answers from memory. It's as if the answers to basic math problems are kept in a long-term storage area in the brain, which was built from repetition. \"Experience really does matter,\" said Dr. Kathy Mann Koepeke. Children make the shift from counting to fact retrieval when they are 8 to 9 years old, the study shows. This is the time when most students are learning basic addition and subtraction. When kids have basic math facts memorized, the brain has more free space to learn more complicated math. This process has benefits for the future. The study shows as kids grow older, their answers rely more on memory and become quicker and more accurate. Less brain activity is devoted to counting. Some children make this shift quicker than others. What happens to kids when they are 8 to 9 years old?",

        "question": "We're always looking for well-written reviews of books, music, movies, television shows, websites, video games and other products. When writing a review, concentrate on exactly what you liked or didn't like. Give examples of strengths and weaknesses, be descriptive and provide background information on an author, director, actor or musician, if possible. Find professional reviews in magazines or newspapers and see how reviewers deal with their topic, but be sure to express your own voice in your review. Grammar Hint for Reviews: When describing a book, movie, album or anything else, use the present tense. Book Reviews Discuss an author's technique, strengths and weaknesses instead of focusing on the plot. Does the story flow? Is there a strong sense of character and place? Did you stay up until dawn to finish it? Is it good reading for teenagers? What influence did it have on you and why? If you've read other books by the same author, discuss how this book compares. Movie Reviews Think of the major Oscar categories and consider the performances, music, lighting and setting, etc. Do these work together? Did some hold up while others didn't? If the movie is based on a book, discuss whether one is better than the other and why. If the movie is a remake, compare the film to its original. Remember that a well-written movie review should discuss strengths and weaknesses. Some readers may not have seen a movie yet, so don't give away an exciting scene or the ending! College Reviews Begin by providing an overview of the college, including location, size and a description of the campus and/or dorm life. Think about all aspects of your college visit. What academic, athletic and after-class programs are available? What are the students like? What makes the college different from others? Every school has strengths and weaknesses. Be objective. Consider what the school has to offer and who might enjoy or benefit the most from attending there. Where can you probably find the passage?",

        "question": "The Chinese word \"Shanzhai\" literally means a small mountain village, but it's now used to describe products that have names similar to famous ones. It became an accepted name for fake goods   after \"Shanzhai Cellphones\" produced by small workshops in southern China became popular in the mainland market over the past two years. Besides \"Shanzhai\" electronic products, there are \"Shanzhai\" movies, \"Shanzhai\" stars and even a \"Shanzhai\" Spring Festival Gala , a copy of the 25-year-old traditional show presented by CCTV on Chinese Lunar New Year's Eve.  \"Shanzhai\" has become a culture of its own, standing foranything that _ something famous,which has caused a public debate over whether it is healthy or sick being a copycat. In southwestern China's Chongqing, a \"Shanzhai\"-version \"Bird's Nest\" built by farmers with bamboo attracts wide attention and the \"Shanzhai\"-version \"Water Cube\" is popular with tourists. Both are copies of the famous Olympics places in Beijing.  Xie Xizhang, a literature critic, said that taking the \"Shanzhai\" Gala as an example, when the traditional CCTV program becomes less and less attractive to the audience, the \"Shanzhai\" version appears naturally to attract people.  \"In spite of its poor techniques and operation, 'Shanzhai' culture meets the demands of common people and could be a comfort to their minds,\" Xie said.   Tian Huiqun, a professor at Beijing Normal University, said that \"Shanzhai\" culture never copies classic things, only products in fashion. In that sense, it's like a computer virus without meaning.  Though controversial, \"Shanzhai\" culture is a challenge as well as a motivation, said Xie, according to the newspaper.

        "question": "Travel is fun and exciting, but it's not if you get sick. You may think, \"Not me, I won't get sick in my holiday.\" But, for many people, that is what happens. Of course you don't want to spend your holiday sick in bed. So what can you do to stay in good health? There are three things you should remember when you travel: relax, sleep, and eat well. A holiday must be a time for relaxing. But very often it is not. Think about what you do when you are a traveller. There are many places to visit: museums, shops, parks, churches. You may spend most days walking around these places. This can be very tiring. You may have a terrible headache after a few hours. If this is the way you feel, you should take a rest. Don't ask your body to do too much. A tired body means a weak body. And a weak body gets sick easily. So sit down for a few hours in a nice place. In good weather, look for a quiet park bench . Or you can stop at a cafe. You can learn a lot by watching people while you rest. Sleep is also important. If you want to stay healthy, you need to get enough sleep. You may have trouble sleeping at night when you travel. There may be too many noises in your hotel or the bed may be uncomfortable. If this is true, don't be afraid to change rooms or hotels. Or you may get enough sleep for another reason. You may want to stay out late at night. In many cities, the nightlife can be very exciting. Then you should plan to sleep for an hour during the day. The extra  hour can make a big difference.  Finally, if you want to stay healthy, you must eat the right kinds of foods but you need to be careful about how much you eat. Lots of food is not good for you. So, remember this, if you want to enjoy your holiday, take care of yourself. Give your body some rest. Get enough sleep and eat good, healthy food. Travel is   _",

After the party I was told by the fellow teacher that American women have a special saying about birthdays. If a woman is over 40, or even if she is 80, her birthday is always the 39th. If she is in her thirties, her birthday will be the 29th. And in her twenties, it's the 19th. They usually have their \"real\" birthday when they are below 20. This shows that American women, especially elderly women, are very sensitive  about their ages. But my teacher always says, \"We want to be younger,\" so about the age of Western women, my advice is that if you don't know it, don't ask about it; if you really know it, don't mention it.

        "question": "Everyone makes mistakes in life, but for whales and dolphins, the \"mistake\" of landing on the shore costs the highest price---their lives. People living along the coast of Australia and New Zealand have been shocked and saddened by the number of whales and dolphins that they have found on their beaches recently. Since November 28th, 96 whales and dolphins have died in Australia and 53 whales died in New Zealand. Although 20 whales were saved, some of these were not expected to live, as they were too weak to swim with the others back to sea. Bob Brown, leader of Australia's Green party, said the mass beaching was caused by the recent \"sound bombing\" of the ocean floor between the two countries. This is a method of testing for oil and gas reserves  . But mass beaching of whales has long puzzled scientists. Typically most members of the stranded   group will appear to be perfectly healthy. \"Some researchers believe that close relationship within the group causes the problem, if one gets into trouble, the others will not leave\" said Shery Gibney, a leading biologist in New Zealand. \"Some will come in and try and assist it; if they get trapped on the beach, then more will come.\" Another common theory is that the whales' navigation   system are thought to break down in some way. It has been said that whales follow electromagnetic   patterns in the sea-bed. The whales can get confused because these patterns sometimes change. That would be a bit like a new roundabout   being built on a road you were used to driving on. You might be confused for a minute when you come to it for the first time, and you might even take a wrong turning before getting back on your route. A different idea is that when whales chase fish for food they end up in shallow waters because they are not paying attention to where they are going. And yet, from time to time a group will swim on purpose into shallow waters and end up on the beach, where they die. If returned to the sea, some whales often show great determination in restraining themselves. Which of the following can be used to explain the term \"sound bombing\"?",

        "question": "She is widely seen as proof that good looks can last for ever. But, at nearly 500 years of age, time is catching up with the Mona Lisa. The health of the famous picture, painted by Leonardo da Vinci in 1505, is getting worse by the year, according to the Louver Museum  where it is housed. \"The thin, wooden panel on which the Mona Lisa is painted in oil has changed shape since experts checked it two years ago,\" the museum said. Visitors have noticed changes but repairing the world's most famous painting is not easy. Experts are not sure about the materials the Italian artist used and their current chemical state. Nearly 6 million people go to see the Mona Lisa every year, many attracted by the mystery of her smile. \"It is very interesting that when you're not looking at her, she seems to be smiling, and then you look at her and she stops,\" said Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University. \"It's because direct vision  is excellent at picking up details, but less suited to looking at shadows. Da Vinci painted the smile in shadows.\" However, the actual history of the Mona Lisa is just as mysterious as the smile. Da Vinci himself loved it so much that he always carried it with him, until it was eventually sold to France's King Francis I in 1519. In 1911, the painting was stolen from the Louver by a former employee, who took it out of the museum, hidden under his coat. He said he planned to return it to Italy. The painting was sent back to France two years later. During World War II, French hid the painting in small towns to keep it out of the hands of German forces. We can infer from the text that  _",

        "question": "You may have heard about the many benefits of yoga, but a recent New York Times story, has stirred up more than a little controversy in the yoga community. \"How Yoga Can _ Your Body,\" by science writer William J. Broad, quotes a long-time yoga teacher who \"...has come to believe that 'the vast majority of people' should give up yoga altogether. It's simply too likely to cause harm.\" He goes on to describe a number of cases where people have been injured doing yoga, including himself. The research in the article isn't groundbreaking: doing any form of exercise you could potentially hurt yourself. If you look at the injury rates of other physical activities, the number of injuries sustained from yoga would pale in comparison. Practicing yoga is just like anything in life: You have to push yourself in order to grow. But you also have to know your limits and when you're breaking them. If you stick to your comfort zone, you'll never be able to increase your flexibility. If you push to the point where you're not only uncomfortable, but in real pain, you'll likely injure yourself. The reasons that yoga causes \"serious injury\", according to the Times story, range from students' physical weaknesses to inexperienced teachers pushing too hard to the growing number of inflexible \"urbanites who sit in chairs all day\" trying hard to twist themselves into difficult postures. Yoga is called a \"practice\" for a reason. You don't have to be perfect. You don't have to tackle every pose. It doesn't matter if you can touch the floor with your palms during your first forward bend or your thousandth, or if you never get there. We go to the mat to learn to better listen to what our bodies are telling us, and to better hear that quiet inner voice drowned out by the noise of our busy lives. It's a shame to discourage the majority of people from practicing yoga and missing out on all of the mind-body benefits that going to the mat has to offer. Which is not mentioned among the reasons for yoga being likely to cause injury?",

If you stand some distance  away from the starter, you can see smoke from his gun before the sound reaches your ears. This great speed of light produces some strange facts. Sunlight  takes about 8 minutes to reach us. If you look at the light of the moon tonight, remember that the light rays left the moon 1.3 seconds before they reached you. The nearest star is so far away that the light that you can see from it tonight started to travel towards you four years ago at a speed of nearly 2 million km. per minute. In some cases, the light from one of tonight's stars had started on its journey to you before you were born. Thus, if we want to be honest, we can't say, \"The stars are shining tonight.\" We have to say instead, \"The stars look pretty.

        "question": "On the whole, it's not something we parents shout about, but one in four of us does it. Hiring private tutors for our children is now widespread. \"It's expensive, but worth it,\" says Ashan Sabri, whose daughter Zarreen, is having tuition in biology and chemistry in preparation for A-levels this summer. \"My husband and I tried to tutor her at home, but we found all our knowledge was out of date and we were only confusing Zarreen. We also tried a group revision course but all the children were sitting in a room for different kinds of exams. On the whole, we think one-to-one tuition works best.\" The real reason is: does tutoring do any good? \"It's not the _ ,\" says Professor Judith Ireson, author of a 2005 Institute of Education report on the subject. \"It's still up to the child to do the learning. If he or she isn't interested, sending them to a private tutor won't do any good. However, we did find that students who had private tuition in mathematics during the two years before GCSE achieved on average just under half a grade higher than students who did not have a tutor.\" In which case, surely it's time to break open the champagne? Not necessarily, says Elaine Tyrrell, head of The Rowans School, Wimbledon, a preparation school which regularly gets children into the best private schools. \"While we recommend private tutoring for a few children whose first language isn't English, we don't encourage it for the others. With the level of education they get here, children really ought to be able to pass the entrance exams without any extra teaching. And our worry is that they might just get used to getting help from last-minute tutoring, but, once they actually get to that school, they won't be able to cope.\" But Mylene Curtis, owner of Fleet Tutors, one of the biggest tutoring agencies in the country, holds a different view. \"In some respects, the hurdles children have to leap in order to get into these schools are set at a higher level than the reality,\" says Curtis. \"We often find that, once a child has got into a school, the standard of work isn't as high as was feared. The trick is to do well enough in the exam to win a place.\" What does Ashan Sabri think of the group revision course?",

        "question": "Most young architects--particularly those in big cities--can only dream about working in a building of their own. And making that dream come true often means finding a building no one else seems to want, which is exactly what happened to David Yocum and his partner, Brain Bell. Their building is a former automobile electrical--parts firm in Atlanta. From the outside, it looks too old, even something horrible, but open the door and you are in a wide, open courtyard, lined on three sides with rusting   walls. In 2000, Yocum and Bell found this building in the city's West End. Built in 1947, the structure had been abandoned   years earlier and the roof of the main building had fallen down. But the price was right, so Yocum bought it. He spent eight months of his off-hours on demolition  , pulling rubbish out through the roof, because it was too dangerous to go inside the building, The demolition was hard work, but it gave him time to think about what he wanted to do, and \"to treasure what was there--the walls, the rust, the light,\" Yocum said. \"Every season, more paint falls off the walls and more rust develops. It's like an art installation   in there--a slow-motion show.\" Since the back building had been constructed without windows, an all-glass front was added to the building to give it a view of the courtyard, and skylights were installed in the roof. The back of the building is a working area and a living room for Yocum and his wife. A sort of buffer   zone between the front and the back contains a bathroom, a kitchen and a mechanical   room, and the walls that separate these zones have openings that allow views through to the front of the studio and the courtyard beyond. Yocum and Bell, who have just completed an art gallery for the city, feel that the experience from the decoration of their building, focusing on the inside rather than the outside, has influenced their work. It has also given these architects a chance to show how they can make more out of less. The main idea of the passage is that  _  .",

Sonya Hall, 33, of Denny Avenue, Lancaster, had only just attended one first aid class the day before when she found herself needing to use the skills on her three years old daughter Tilly.               Sonya, who also has son Emmen, six, attended the first aid course at Lune Park Children's Centre in Lancaster. Then she was faced with every parent's worst nightmare when Tilly went blue in the face and stopped breathing. But thanks to her newly acquired skills, Sonya saved Tilly's life.               Sonya said: \"Tilly was playing with her brother and they were fighting over a toy. Emmen won the fight. Tilly fell backwards and her head was hit. She was face down and shaking and at first I thought she was upset. But then I saw she was blue in the face and had stopped breathing. I reacted without thinking and immediately started using the first aid skills I had learned the day before which were so fresh in my mind. I began doing mouth-to-mouth and chest compressions  . It probably took about a minute before Tilly started breathing again, but to me it felt like a lifetime.\"               After getting Tilly breathing again, Sonya called an ambulance and the doctors came. Since then, Tilly has been diagnosed   with Reflex Anoxic Seizure  . Sonya said: \"The seizure can happen when there's any unexpected pain, fear or fright. It is just so lucky that the day before it happened, I had been practising first aid.\"               The Empowering Parents First Aid course is run by Lancashire Adult Learning. Sonya said: \"I am just so glad I did the course and learnt the first aid skills.

        "question": "prefix = st1 /West Virginia--Public schools are using a dance video game to help get students in shape. In these schools, students are often told to turn off their video games and get some exercise. The schools have found a new way for their students to work out while playing a new video game. West Virginiais one of the heaviest states in the country. About half of its fifth-graders are considered to be overweight, and their parents are worried about that. To get them moving on a healthier path, the state's public schools are using a video game called \"Dance Dance Revolution\".    To use the game, players should stand on a special mat in front of a TV screen. Following arrows on the screen, players must move their feet to the specific symbols on the mat. Players must move quickly, touching symbols on the mat at just the right time. With each song, they get more exercise.    \"It we can get children to change their behavior at a young age, they will hopefully grow up to be healthy and active adults,\" said Carl Callison of Mountain State Blue Cross, a health care company.     West Virginiais ranked among the top three heaviest states. About a third of West Virginians are considred to be obese. Even more are considered to be overweight. Extra weight can lead to serious health problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, some cancers, and many other health issues.    \"One out of three children born in West Virginia today will have diabetes by the time they grow up,\" said Nidia Henderson, a manager for the public employees' insurance  program. \"That's a terrible thing and not acceptable.\"    All ofWest Virginia's 157 middle schools are using the video game. School officials hope that all public schools in the state will use the game within the next three years. However, officials emphasize that the game is not meant to _ physical education and health classes. The game will be part of physical education classes and after-school programs.

        "question": "My grandmother was from a town in Michigan. Summer after summer, I enjoyed staying with my grandparents as a young child. I was from the city and loved the small town they lived in. People knew everyone, their kids, their pets, their ancestors. The bond with them continued to grow as I grew and they got older. Grandma was always using her hands for something exciting. She would make little sandwiches and we'd have tea parties. She'd make beautiful quilts for each one. I remember the small thimble  she would use while doing her needle work. A few years ago, when Grandma left this earth, I bid farewell to a loving grandmother. How quickly our lives can change. We had just had tea together a couple of months earlier, on her 91st birthday. I missed her very much. On one particular birthday, when I was feeling a little low, something happened to make me feel like she was sharing that special day with me. I was arranging some colorful pillows that she had made, and suddenly I felt something inside one pillow. It was small and hard. I moved the object to a seam  that I carefully opened, and to my delight out came a tiny silver thimble! How happy I was to find something that had been a part of her. Not realizing it had fallen off her finger, I pictured her sewing it in that little pillow that I just happened to place on my bedspread that day. I carefully laid the thimble alongside the others I've collected over the years, where I could continue to see the gift God chose to reveal to me. What a precious memory of a very special lady who somehow, I knew, was laughing in delight at sewing her thimble inside my pillow. I made some tea, using my best china, as Grandma always did, and enjoyed my tea and Grandma's thimble. What a wonderful birthday that was!

        "question": "I hated dinner parties. But I decided to give them another shot because I'm in London. And my friend Mallery invited me. And because dinner parties in London are very different from those back in New York. There, 'I'm having a dinner party' means: 'I'm booking a table for 12 at a restaurant you can't afford and we'll be sharing the checque evenly, no matter what you eat.' Worse, in Manhattan there is always someone who leaves before the bill arrives. They'll throw down cash, half of what they owe, and then people like me, who don't drink, end up paying even more. But if I try to use the same trick, the hostess will shout: \"Where are you going?\" And it's not like I can say I have somewhere to go: everyone knows I have nowhere to go. But in London, dinner parties are in people's homes. Not only that, the guests are an interesting mix. The last time I went to one, the guests were from France, India, Denmark and Nigeria; it was like a gathering at the United Nations in New York. The mix is less striking. It's like a gathering at Bloomingdale's, a well-known department store. For New Yorkers, talking about other parts of the world means Brooklyn and Queens in New York. But at Mallery's, when I said that I had been to Myanmar recently, people knew where it was.

Once, at his 70th birthday party, a friend asked Freud if he could put his work into several words.\"Well,\"said Freud, \"we take the sick out of their trouble and return them to the common suffering.\" As a devoted son, Freud often visited his old mother. His mother usually spent her summer in a small mountain town in Austria. The King Josef usually spent his summer there, too. One day in the summer, a band was playing a lively tune when Freud's mother was sitting at the window and watching the people singing and dancing on Main Street. The old woman had a poor memory. She heard the band playing, but forgot it was the King's birthday. Freud was visiting his mother on her 95th birthday. He told his mother, \"Mama, the band is playing for your birthday.\"She believed him and had a wonderful day. Which of the four sentences is wrong?",

        "question": "ScienceDaily (July 5, 2009) -- Researchers from the University of Haifa-Oranim have managed to make out the \"self-irrigating\" mechanism  of the desert rhubarb , which enables it to harvest 16 times the amount of water collected by other plants in the Negev Desert. This is the first example of a self-irrigating plant worldwide. The desert rhubarb grows in the mountains of Israel's Negev desert, where average rainfall is particularly low (75 mm per year). Unlike most of the other desert plant species, which have small leaves so as to reduce water loss, this plant is unique in that its leaves are particularly large; each plant's rosette  of one to four leaves reaches a total diameter  of up to one meter.  Prof. Simcha Lev-Yadun, Prof. Gidi Ne'eman and Prof. Gadi Katzir came across this unique plant while studying the field area with students of the Department of Science Education-Biology of the University of Haifa-Oranim, and noticed that its waxy leaves are unusually large. They observed an exceptionally ridged  structure on each leaf.  The scientists explained that these deep and wide depressions in the leaves create a \"channeling\" mountain-like system by which the rain water is channeled toward the ground surrounding the plant's deep root. Other desert plants simply absorb the rain water that goes through the ground in its immediate surroundings.  The desert rhubarb is able to harvest quantities of water that are 16 times the amount of water harvested by the small-leafed plants of the Negev desert region. When the research team watered the plant artificially, they observed how the water flows along the course of the leave's depressions to the ground surrounding the plant's single root and then goes through the ground to a depth of 10 cm or more. Under the experimental conditions, water goes through the ground only as deep as 1 cm.  \"We know of no other plant in the deserts of the world that functions in this manner,\" the researchers concluded. Scientists discover the desert rhubarb can irrigate itself with its  _  .",

        "question": "No one wants to look silly or do the wrong thing at a new job. It's important to make the right impression   from the first day. You will face new people. You will be in a new place. It may be difficult to know what to do. Here are seven tips to help you make it through the first days at a new job: 1. First impression is important. Make sure you make a good one. Before your first day, find out if your new job has _ . If so, be sure to follow it. No matter what you wear, always be neat   and clean. 2. Get to work on time. Employers value workers who come to work on time. Give yourself an extra 15 minutes to make sure you arrive on time. 3. Pay attention to introduction. One of the first things that your supervisor   may do is to introduce you to co-workers. These co-workers will be important to you. They are the ones who will answer your questions when the boss isn't around. 4. Ask plenty of questions. Make sure that your supervisor has told you what your are expected to do. If he or she has not told you your job duties, ask for a list. Set daily and weekly goals for yourself. 5. Don't make personal phone calls. You should never make personal phone calls to your friends and family unless it's an emergency. 6. Don't take too long for lunch. What's the lunch-hour policy at your new job? You can find out from your supervisor or your company's personnel department . For example, do people eat at their desks or does everyone take a full hour outside the workplace? 7. Never be the first one to leave. Observe how your co-workers behave around quitting   time. It does no good for you to be eager to leave.

        "question": "James Cooke, of Islip,N.Y.,can't recognize other people. \"I see eyes, nose, cheekbones, but no face,\" he said. \"I've even passed by my son and daughter without recognizing them.\"  He is not the only one. Those with prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, can see perfectly well, but their brains are unable to piece together the information needed to understand that a collection of features represents an individual's face. The condition is a neurological mystery, but new research has shed light on this strange disease.  Some scientists had believed that faces and voices, the two main ways people recognize one another, were processed separately by the brain. Indeed, a condition parallel to prosopagnosia, called  _ , similarly leaves a person unable to distinguish a familiar voice from an unfamiliar one. But by testing for these two conditions at the same time, researchers at the Max Planck Institute recently found evidence that face and voice recognition may be linked in a unique person-recognition system. The scientists observed the brain activity of 19 healthy volunteers as they were led through tasks that tested their ability to recognize both faces and voices. The researchers found that regions of the brain, associated with facial recognition, are directly linked to regions responsible for voice recognition.  This research helps explain why a person with prosopagnosia may still have difficulty determining who a person is even after he has begun to speak. The challenge for scientists is to find out where this system breaks down. Are these connections in the brain missing entirely, or are people unable to recognize faces and voices simply unable to use these links in some way?  It is unclear how many people have these conditions. Many don't even realize they have problems with facial or voice recognition. While some develop these difficulties after a brain injury, others develop it in childhood. James Cooke can't recognize other people because  _  .",

        "question": "I was born in Brooklyn. My father was a small-business man and we never had much money. He supported the family, moved us to Merrick on Long Island, when I was 11. He just recently died at age 96. He was still driving and playing golf right to the end. He was the only guy I knew who at age 90 could shoot under his age. I guess that taught me something about perseverance.  I went to the University of Michigan as an engineering student in 1960. I was standing outside the student union building when Senator John F. Kennedy made a campaign speech that essentially announced his plan for the Peace Corps. He talked about how students could provide service for the country. It was an important moment for me.  After I graduated, I worked as a computer programmer for I.B.M. for two years. By then, the Vietnam War was in full swing and the draft  had accelerated. I didn't agree with the war and was interested in finding alternatives. I.B.M. applied for a delay for me twice but the application failed.  I went to work at M.I.T.'s Instrumentation Labs on a project designed to create a rescue vehicle for lost submarines . I thought this job would keep me out of the draft, but M.I.T. hadn't put in the proper paperwork and I got called in for my physical. The day before my physical, I broke my ankle playing tennis and, of course, my draft board didn't believe a word of it. I had to provide X-rays. I had tears in my eyes from the pain, but a smile on my face.  I started John Snow Inc. in 1978 (Dr. Snow is considered the father of modern epidemiology because he traced the source of a cholera epidemic in the 1850s). We had a very clear vision of what we would be. It would not be about making the most money but having the most impact.  My goal was to attract talented people who had that passion to focus on primary care, women's health, child health, and to do great work. I also run a nonprofit called World Education, which focuses on literacy. What motivates me is going to the field, either in the United States or overseas, and seeing the people whose lives we affect.  I didn't grow up rich but had the advantage of growing up in the United States and getting a good education. I couldn't have started J.S.I. in many other places.

        "question": "The speed of light is often called a\"constant \". New experiments show that may not be true, even within a vacuum. Sometimes, light slows a bit. The new research is\"very impressive work\", Robert Boyd toldScienceNews.An optical physicist at the University of Rochester in New York, he did not work on the study. He speaks of the new finding:\"It's the sort of thing that's so obvious; you wonder why you didn't think of it first.\" Light travels as particles and as waves. Photons are the name given to those particles that represent the smallest possible amount of light. At their fastest, photons travel nearly 300 million meters (almost 1 billion feet) in a single second. That's fast enough to get to the moon and back in about 2.6 seconds. Scientists had long known, though, that they could slow light photons down by shining them through a material such as glass or water. Still, light moving through a vacuum has usually been assumed to move at a peak speed. That would seem to make sense. After all, a vacuum is a space with nothing in it to slow light down. In a new study, however, scientists show that even racing through a vacuum, light can slow. So the speed of light is more of a universal speed limit than an   rule for how fast photons travel, the new data suggest. Miles Padgett led the new study. As an optical physicist, he works at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and his colleagues showed that the key to slowing light is to change the shape of a light wave. Padgett described how they did this in a paper published online January 22 inScience. His team raced a pair of photons. One traveled unchanged through a cable made from optical fibers. The other passed through a pair of devices that acted like lenses. A lens changes light: It can focus a spread-out beam of light on a point, for instance. The second photon passed through one device that changed the shape of its waveand another that changed it back to its original form. The first photon won the race. The second photon came in a tiny bit later, several quadrillionths  of a second late for every meter of the race. The difference wasn't huge, but it was enough to measure. Most technology would not pick up such a small change, but it could be important to scientists who study short pulses of light. \"I'm not surprised the effect exists,\"Boyd toldScienceNews.\"But it's surprising that the effect is so large and strong.\" The passage mainly tells    .",

        "question": "In my thirty years as a Time Management speaker, I have observed a lot of what we can and should not do to increase our daily success. Time management is not necessarily working harder, but quicker and more smartly. Sometimes our mistakes will keep us from running at a full pace. Here are the top four Time Management mistakes we should all avoid to help us to increase our daily success. a. Start your day without a plan of action in the morning. If so, you will have worked hard but may not have done enough of right things. Time Management is not doing the wrong things.  b. Work with a messy desk or work area. Studies have shown that the person who works with a messy desk spends one and a half hours per day looking for things. If you have ever visited the office of a top manager who is working with a clean desk, you will find that the manager works efficiently . c. Don't get enough sleep. Studies show that nearly 75% of the people around us complain about not having  enough sleep, and then throughout their days they are tired. For most people, they get the quantity of sleep, but they lack the quality of sleep. Their days are filled with so much stress; they are out of control, working harder but maybe not more smartly, so it's difficult for them to get a full night's sleep.  d. Don't take a lunch break. Many do not take a lunch break, working through that period in the hope that it will give them more time to increase their success. Studies have shown that it may have the opposite effect. After doing what we do for several hours, we start to feel tired. A lunch break, even short, gives us a chance to get our energy back again. The best title for the passage is   _  .",

        "question": "We have now known something about computers---computers work for us at home, in offices and in factories. But it is also true that many children today are using computers at schools before they can write. What does this mean for the future? Are these children lucky or not? Many people do not know about computers and they think of them as machines that children play with. They worry that children do not learn from experience but just from pressing* a button* and that this is not good for them. They think that children are growing not knowing about the real world. And they are very worried about that their children will lose themselves in the computer games. But many people understand more about computers, they say that computers can be very good for children. A computer can help them to learn about the real world more quickly, to learn what they want to learn and think for themselves. And for the future, don't we need people who can think clearly, who know how to get information quickly and use it well? What do you think? For example, e-mail is very popular at this moment. Do you know about e-mail? E-mail is a way of sending messages to other people. E-mail is a fast and cheap way to keep in touch with friends and family. It's much quicker than sending a letter. People who use e-mail have an e-mail address. This address must have letters and dots* and the symbol \"@\"meaning \"at\". This is what an address looks like. People can send the messages across the Internet. It is quick, easy and fun. What can computers help children to do?",

        "question": "Colin walked slowly home from school. He looked across the hills at the little Irish fishing village. It did not seem like Christmas Eve. Perhaps this was because it still had not snowed. But Colin knew there was another reason--a reason he did not dare whisper even in his heart.  He looked toward the sea. There was no ship. And seven days ago his father's fishing boat hadn't gone home in time. \"I'll bring you a small sheep dog from the Shetland Isles,\" Colin's father told him the morning he left. But now it was Christmas Eve. Colin looked toward the lighthouse, high on the hill. For seven days, there had been no light to guide his father's ship.  Colin pushed open the door of his cottage. \"We'll need more peat   for the fire, Colin,\" said his mother as he entered. \"It has burned itself out. And it's near time to light the Christmas candle. Everybody in Ireland lights a candle on Christmas Eve, even when there's sadness in the house. It shows that your house and heart are open to strangers. I've two candles, one for each of us. If you gather some peat, we'll be ready for supper soon.\" Colin nodded and went outside.  He led their donkey up the hill. But while he was staring at the lighthouse, Colin had an idea. He came to the lighthouse and knocked on the door.  Mr. Duffy, the keeper, opened the door. \"What's up, young man?\" \"Mr. Duffy,\" said Colin, \"what did you use to light the lighthouse?\" \"Well, we used an oil lamp. But we've no oil to burn.\" \"Maybe kerosene   would do,\" suggested Colin.  \"Well, I suppose,\" Mr. Duffy thought. \"But you wouldn't find even a little spare kerosene in this village. Everyone is so poor ...\" Colin was gone before Mr. Duffy could finish his sentence.  He ran back to the cottage. Then he ran out with four buckets. Colin could see candles glowing in nearly every cottage in the valley. A candle on Christmas Eve meant that a stranger would be welcome and given whatever he asked. He didn't stop running until he came to the first house.  \"Could you spare me just a half cup of kerosene from your lamp?\" he asked. Colin went to every house where a candle was shining . In one hour he had filled two buckets. Slowly and painfully he carried them up to the lighthouse door.  \"What's this?\" Mr. Duffy asked. \"This won't keep the lamp burning for more than an hour or so.\" \"I'll get more!\" Colin shouted as he started down the hill.  After three more long hours, Colin had gathered five more buckets of kerosene. He was on his way with the sixth pail, when the tower suddenly shone with light. The light spread toward the dark heart of the sea like a finger pointing home. Mr. Duffy had lighted the lamp!  It was very late when Colin reached home. His mother jumped from her seat near the fire.  \"Colin, where have you been? You've had no supper, nor lighted your candle!\" \"Oh, mom! I've lighted a candle, and it's a big one!\" Colin slept soundly that night, dreaming of candles. Suddenly, a loud shout aroused him from his sleep.  \"The boat! The boat was just different in the fog, lost.\" Colin rushed to the window. His mother was running toward the harbor. It was true! There floated his father's boat. Colin ran across the yard and raced to the harbor. He felt a wet wind on his face. It was beginning to snow.  Oh, it was Christmas morning all right, falling right from heaven and into his heart!

        "question": "Barcodes  aren't given much thought by the majority of consumers, but these codes were fairly recently applied in a working fashion in 1970. A small food store owner decided one day that keeping records of the inventory  of his stock and the associated prices were an extremely laborious process, and so, in 1948, he contacted The Drexel Institute of Technology in a bid to work towards a solution. Bernard Sliver rose to the challenge and set out to study the problem and began working on a solution involving an automatic way of keeping track of items that had been sold. Sliver and a group of students from the institute realized their answer in the form of ultraviolet light  , ink and a scanner. The system worked initially, but possessed some negatives. It was incredibly costly to carry out on a large scale and the system was also unstable. If the invention was to become commonplace in grocery stores, these two problems had to be solved. The patent   for the bar code system was filed by Sliver and one of his students, Woodland. The patent was not granted immediately; in fact, it took three years for the patent agency to grant their invention patent for the barcode, occurring on 7thOctober, 1952. Despite the patent being issued, the system was still not welcomed by the majority of store owners. It was not until 1966 that the system began moving its way into more and more grocery stores. This system was soon criticized, as there was no central mechanism for controlling uniformly coded items. In 1970, Logicom developed the Universal Grocery Products Identification code( UGOIC), soon shortened to Universal Identification Number (UPC). It was Marsh's superstore, in Troy, which was the very first store to install this complex barcode reading system, and its popularity has soared  ever since, and is obviously now commonplace in all types of stores worldwide. The popularity of the barcode rose quickly after  _  .",

        "question": "As the saying goes, man struggles upwards; water flows downwards. Water runs downhill from mountaintops to streams to rivers to oceans. But downhill isn't the only way that water moves .A new study measures how water travels from country to country for human consumption. This flow isn't the type we usually think about .These scientists looked at the water used to grow and make the products which get shipped from nation to nation as imports or exports. They call this a flow of \"virtual water \". We typically think about water as the liquid that flows from a tap. However,92%of the water used by people goes into growing crops,according to water researcher Arjen Hoekstra. He recently studied the hidden travels of virtual water used in products made from things like crops and meats .These products are shipped around the world. For example, consider a sugary soft drink. Hoekstra estimated that to produce one half-liter of the drink requires between 170 and 310liters of the water--about 95%--is used to grow and process the ingredients .Another 4%goes into the packaging and labeling. In Hoekstra's calculation, when one country produces a half-liter of soda and sells it abroad,it exports as much virtual water as would fill a large refrigerator. According to Hoekstra's new report,dry countries like Israel and Kuwait,both in the Middle East,get the majority of their virtual water from other countries,through imported products. More surprisingly, some wetter countries,like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, also get the majority of their virtual water from other places. That means that most of the water used to grow or produce the products and food consumed in those countries came from other countries. In the United States most of the virtual water used comes from American sources .In China even less of the water associated with its products. In which countries does most part of virtual water come from outside?   _",

        "question": "We all want to live in good neighborhoods, but not everyone lives in a good neighborhood. How can you build a better community for yourself and your family? There are many things you can do. Paint your intersection . A street intersection is not something you think of as interesting. However, In Portland, people in some neighborhoods have made them really worth stopping for. Some paint, creative people and a bright design are all it takes to bring neighbors together and produce something the whole community can be proud of. Make a poetry box. The idea is simple, really - create a box with a glass or clear plastic front. Put this box on a post. Write your own poem or print out your favorite classic and display it in the box for all your neighbors to see. You can also set up a drop box and encourage neighbors to write their own poems and drop them in the box. Display the poems from your neighbors as the poems come in. Set up a tool library. How often do you need a leaf blower? Or a chain saw? And how often do you use that electric cake mixer? To01 libraries have space where neighbors can drop their hardly used tools to share. Check with a local business, community center or church group about space that can house a tool library. Turn your front yard into your backyard. How often do you meet your neighbors in your backyard? Probably never. Moving your typical  backyard activities to the front immediately makes you more visible . You can create front-yard gardens, build community benches and even just barbecue in your front yard. They are all great ways to connect with your community. With effort, you'll make your neighborhood a much better place. Which of the following is NOT true?",

        "question": "American black bears appear in a variety of colors despite  their name. In the eastern part, most of these bears have shiny black fur, but in the west they grow brown, red, or even yellow coats. To the north, the black bear is actually gray or white in color. Even in the same litter , both brown and black furred bears may be born. Black bears are the smallest of all American bears, ranging in length from five to six feet, weighing from three hundred to five hundred pounds. Their eyes and ears are small and their eyesight and hearing are not as good as their sense of smell. Like all bears, the black bear is timid and rarely dangerous, but if attacked, most can climb trees or cover ground at great speed. When angry or frightened, they are formidable  _ . Black bears feed on leaves, roots, fruit, insects, fish, and even larger animals. One of the most interesting characteristics of bears, including the black bear, is their winter sleep. Unlike squirrels and many other woodland animals, bears do not actually sleep through the winter months. Although the bear does not eat during the winter months, sustaining  itself from body fat, its temperature remains almost normal, and it breathes regularly four or five times per minute. Most black bears live alone, except during the mating  season. They prefer to live in caves. Baby black bears are born in January or February after a gestation  period of six to nine months, and they stay with their mother until they are fully grown or about one and a half years old. Black bears can live as long as thirty years in the wild, and even longer in some nature reserves. Which of the following statements is RIGHT?",

        "question": "Mosquitoes have an extraordinary ability to target humans far away and fly straight to their unprotected skin. Regrettably,mosquitoes can do more than cause an itchy wound. Some mosquitoes spread several serious diseases,including Dengue,yellow fever and  malaria. Over one million people worldwide die from these diseases each year. New research now   shows how mosquitoes choose who to bite. Mosquitoes need blood to survive. They are attracted to human skin and breath. They smell the carbon dioxide gas,which all mammals breathe out. This gas is the main way for mosquitoes to know that a warm-blooded creature is nearby. But mosquitoes also use their eyes and sense of touch. Michael Dickinson is a professor at the California Institute of Technology. His research shows how these small insects,with even smaller brains,use three senses to find a blood meal. Michael Dickinson's team used plumes--a material that rises into the air of carbon dioxide gas into a wind tunnel. They then used cameras to record the mosquitoes. The insects followed the plume. Then,the scientists placed dark objects on the lighter  colored floor and walls of the  tunnel. Mr. Dickinson said,at first,the mosquitoes showed no interest in the objects at all.      \"What was quite striking and quite surprising is that the mosquitoes fly back and forth for hours. These are hungry females and they completely ignore the objects on the floor and wall of the tunnel. But the moment they get a hit of CO2,they change their behavior quite obviously and now would become attracted to these little visual blobs  .\" This suggested to the researchers that a mosquito's sense of smell is more important in the search for food. Once mosquitoes catch a smell of a human  or animal,they also follow  visual signals. How can we avoid being attacked by mosquitoes according to the text ?",

        "question": "When thirty-two-year-old tennis player Andre Agassi made to the final of the U.S. Clay Court Championship in April 2003, he set a new world record: he became the oldest player ever to be number one in the world's tennis rankings. It was one of the greatest achievements in Agassi's long and successful career. Andre Agassi turned professional in 1986 at the age of sixteen. His career soon took off, and in 1990, Agassi was famous around the world, though never having won an important tennis championship. Many people thought he was famous more for his long blond hair and colorful tennis shirts than for his tennis skills. They wondered if he could really win an important tournament. In 1992, Agassi proved _ wrong by winning one of the greatest prizes in world tennis--the Wimbledon singles final. His first attempt to win this tournament had been in 1987, but he lost his opening game. He then refused to take part in Wimbledon for the next three years. He said his reason for not playing was that the officials refused to allow him to wear his colorful shirts, but some people said it was because he was afraid to lose. After several more championship victories, Agassi's luck began to run out. By 1997, the year of his marriage to a movie actress--- Brooke Shields, Agassi's ranking had dropped to 141stin the world. Many people thought his career was over. Agassi and Shields divorced two years later, and Agassi made a comeback with a new trainer, a new hairstyle, and new determination. In 1999, he won both the French Open and the U.S. Open and ended the year back as the world's number one. By 2003, he had earned more than $27 million in prize money, making him one of the most successful tennis players of all times. How old was Agassi when he won his first championship?",

        "question": "Jan was a window cleaner. One morning, Jan was in a lift of a high building with his window cleaning tools when the building was on fire. There were five other passengers in the lift. All of a sudden the lift stopped. Although they didn't know what had happened outside, they had only 100 minutes to get out of the building before it would fall into the dust. Soon smoke began coming into the lift. The men knew that something was wrong. They tried to open the door but found a wall in front of them. The wall had the number 15 on it and they knew they were on the 15th floor. But their lift usually didn't stop there, so there was no opening for them to escape. Jan decided they would have to make their own. Knowing that the wall was made of a material that could be cut through, Jan took out his window cleaning tools, and began knocking a hole through the wall. When he felt tired, others helped. Starting with one small hole, they cut through the three-inch-thick wall. Then they kicked hard at the wall. The wall cracked apart. They saw before them a tile   wall! Refusing to give up, they knocked a hole through the tile, then made the opening big enough to get through. Surprisingly, the fire-fighters were outside the hole, they took Jan and his partners to the nearest stairs and they ran down the stairs as quickly as possible. By 10:23, Jan and the others ran out of the building. Five minutes later, the building burned down. From this passage, which do you think is the most important way while in danger?",

        "question": "When we are unfamiliar with something,we may feel nervous and fearful.The assistance of others is a good way to help us pull through.     I write for a big newspaper, and I wanted to write a story about parachute jumping.To make it a realistic as well as exciting story,I decided that I first had to make a jump myself. Unfortunately,I am not good at any sports of any kind,let alone parachute jumping.     My friend Mr. Smith was willing to give me a hand.He took me to a ground school.The first day's training included several hours of instruction but not my first drop from an airplane For this,I had to wait until the following morning.     The next morning,after a hurried,anxious breakfast,I was taken to the airfield.There,two heavy parachutes were put on my back,and an orange helmet was pushed down onto my head.Then I was asked to make my way to a small plane which had just stopped slowly on the runway.     Once on board,the plane was soon climbing.I began to feel nervous.As we reached one thousand metres,Harry,my teacher, hooked a line from my parachute to a steel ring inside the plane.The line was to pull my parachute open after I jumped.     \"Get ready, Henry,\"Harry said.I moved carefully to the door.I wanted to cry,\"No,no,no!\"But no word came.     \"Jump!\"Harry called loudly.\"Jump!\"     To my surprise,kicking like a frog I did jump.Away from the plane,and down,down I fell,arms stretched.It worked! The air seemed to hold me up.All at once I was very happy.    Then I felt a quick pull.My big parachute had opened! It was the best surprise I ever had. I looked down.There were rivers,trees,fields and houses.I heard the soft sound of the air This was fun ! What does the writer intend to tell us through the passage?",

Where is the Bermuda Triangle located? The mysterious triangle is believed to be situated between Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico, where too many unusual events have happened. On December the 5th1945, five U.S. military planes took off from Florida on a clear day only to disappear over Bermuda. Furthermore, some other disappearances took place; in 1947, an American C54 plane simply disappeared at 100 miles from Bermuda; at 80 miles, a Star Tiger plane disappeared in 1948. Even Columbus had trouble in Bermuda. Some of his journals were about the strange happenings there: \"the waters are changing their colors\" and \"compasses are going wild\". Maybe it's why it is called the Devil's triangle or the Atlantic cemetery. Many _ were stated in order to explain the strange events. In spite of these attempts, the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle remains unsolved. Some people get to say that maybe aliens are involved in it. Other imaginative scientists relate the happenings in Bermuda to Einstein's theory, saying that the missing ships and planes are translated to another dimension of space and time and taken into another world.

Some sports are resource-hungry.Golf,as you may know,eats up not only large areas of countryside,but also tons of water.Besides,all sorts of chemicals and huge amounts of energy are used to keep its courses in good condition.This causes major environmental effects.For example,in the dry regions of Portugal and Spain,golf is often held responsible for serious water shortage in some local areas. There are many environment-friendly sports.Power walking is one of them that you could take up today.You don't need any special equipment except a good pair of shoes;and you don't have to worry about resources and your purse.Simple and free,power walking can also keep you fit.If you walk regularly,it will be good for your heart and bones.Experts say that 20 minutes of power walking daily can make you feel less anxious,sleep well and have better weight control. Whatever sport you take up,you can make it greener by using environment-friendly equipment and buying products made from recycled materials.But the final goal should be\"green gyms\".They RYe better replacements for traditional health clubs and modern sports centers. Members of green gyms play sports outdoors,in the countryside or other open spaces.There is no special requirement for you to start your membership.And best of all,it's free.

        "question": "The need to feed a growing population is putting much pressure on the world's supply of water. With 97% of the world's water too salty to be drunk or used in agriculture, the worldwide supply of water needs careful management, especially in agriculture. Although the idea of a water shortage seems strange to someone fortunate enough to live in a high rainfall country, many of the world's agricultural industries experience constant water shortages. Although dams can be built to store water for agricultural use in dry areas and dry seasons, the costs of water redistribution are very high. Not only is there the cost of the engineering itself, but there is also an environmental cost to be considered. Where valleys are flooded to create dams, houses are lost and wildlife homes destroyed. Besides, water may flow easily through pipes to fields, but it cannot be transported from one side of the world to the other. Each country must therefore rely on the management of its own water to supply its farming requirements. This is particularly troubling for countries with agricultural industries in areas dependent on irrigation  . In Texas, farmers' overuse of irrigation water has resulted in a 25% reduction of the water stores. In the Central Valley area of southwestern USA, a huge water engineering project provided water for farming in dry valleys, but much of the water use has been poorly managed. Saudi Arabia's attempts to grow wheat in desert areas have seen the pumping of huge quantities of irrigation water from underground reserves.  Because there is no rainfall in these areas, such reserves can only decrease, and it is believed that fifty years of pumping will see them run dry. The text is mainly about  _  .",

        "question": "What will people die of 100 years from now? If you think that is a simple question, you have not been paying attention to the revolution that is taking place in bio-technology . With the help of new medicine, the human body will last a very long time. Death will come mainly from accidents, murder and war. Today's leading killers, such as heart diseases, cancer, and aging itself, will become distant memory. In discussion of technological changes, the Internet gets most of the attention these days. But the change in medicine can be the real technological event of our times. How long can humans live? Human brains were known to decide the final death. Cells  are the basic units of all living things, and until recently, scientists were sure that the life of cells could not go much beyond 120 years because the basic materials of cells, such as those of brain cells, would not last forever. But the upper limits will be broken by new medicine. Sometime between 2050 and 2100, medicine will have advanced to the point at which every 10 years or so, people will be able to take medicine to repair their organs . The medicine, made up of the basic building materials of life, will build new brain cells, heart cells, and so on---in much the same way our bodies make new skin cells to take the place of old ones. It is exciting to imagine that the advance in technology may be changing the most basic conditional human existence, but many technical problems still must be cleared up on the way to this wonderful future.

        "question": "A new study revealed that the formation of the Earth, Sun and Moon that cause changes in Earth's tides can also trigger a special kind of Earthquake along the California's San Andreas Fault . The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science,is based on previous researcher suggesting that the gravitational tug of sun and moon is not only affecting the sea levels of Earth, but can also stretch and compress that Earth's crust, producing tremors and quakes. Furthermore, the new study showed that small tremors deep underground were more likely to occur during certain periods of the tidal cycle. For the study, the researchers looked at about 81,000 low-frequency earthquakes from 2008 to 2015 along the Parkfield section of the San Andreas Fault and compared it to the two-week tidal cycle known as the \"fortnightly tide,\" Low-frequency earthquakes are named due to the rumbling sound they make and not by the rate of its occurrence. These kinds of earthquake only occur about 15 to 30 kilometers below ground and are no larger than magnitude 1 in the Richter scale. The researchers discovered that low-frequency earthquakes tend to occur during the waxing period of the tidal cycle, when the tides are getting little by little. It is already known that the strongest Earth tides occur when the sun and moon are in a straight line, while the tide is at its weakest state when the sun and moon are 90 degrees apart. According to the researchers, low-frequency earthquakes show that some part of the San Andreas Fault is creeping, or slowly moving, almost all the time. With the help of the tidal forces, low-frequency earthquakes could provide more information about the deeper part of the fault. \"They tell us that the fault continues down below where the regular or typical earthquakes stop on the San Andreas, about 10 or 12 km (about 6 to 7 miles),\" said David Shelly, a seismologist at USGS and helped write the study, in a statement. \"And they tell us a lot of things about that deep part of the fault that we had no idea existed at all before.\" \"It's almost like having a lot of little creep meters embedded in the fault,\"Shelly said. \"We can use these low-frequency earthquakes as measurements of, at least in a   sense, how much slip is happening at each little spot on the deep part of the fault where we see these events. When we don't see them, we don't know what's happening; we don't know whether it,s slipping silently or not slipping at all.\" The information is incredibly useful, he added. Whenever the deep part of the fault slips, the stress gets transferred to the shallow part of the fault. \"So if all of a sudden, we saw that the deep part of the fault was slipping a huge amount, it might be an indication that there was an increased chance of having an earthquake come at the shallower part of the fault\" he said. What causes tremors and quakes according to the passage?",

The tour coversaquatic  life, especially that seen at Lake Norman. Since it is more of an educational one it also covers other important knowledge about water. Those wanting to go boating are seen off into the lake on canoes and pedal boats which are rented on hourly basis. The charges are $5 per hour increased by $3 for everyadditional  hour. The boats can be kept on the lake all day from 10 in the morning till 5 in the evening during the summers. Both canoes and pedal boats can seat 2 to 4 people. The park also set up a group tent camp, where a site can hold about 25 people. People from all over the country come here to catch some fishing action, obviously hoping to catch some fish as well. The inner park lake is also great for fishing, though it offers a smaller area compared to Lake Norman. Those here for adventure like to go for biking and hiking on the trails inside the park.

        "question": "STEVE EMBER: And I'm Steve Ember with People In America in VOA Special English. Today we remember the singer and actress Lena Horne. During her sixty-year career performing, Lena Horne entertained people with her beauty and rich, emotional voice. She used her fame to fight social injustices toward African-Americans. Lena Horne was born in New York. At sixteen, Lena became a dancer at the famous club in New York City in 1933. After taking voice lessons, she soon became a singer. In 1940, Lena Horne became the first African-American to perform with an all-white jazz hand. After performing at a club in Hollywood, California, she caught the attention of filmmakers. She soon began making movies. Her films became very popular. In the 1940s, Lena Horne was the first African-American in Hollywood to sing a long -term contract with a major movie studio. Her deal with MGM stated that she would never play the role of a servant. She refused to play roles that represented African-Americans disrespectfully. Lena Horne once said that World War II helped make her a star. She was popular with both black and white soldiers. She sang on army radio programs and traveled to perform for the troops. These experiences led to Lena Horne's work in the civil rights movement. Lena Horne sang at rights gatherings. She took part in the march on Washington protest in 1963. It was during this event that Martin Luther King gave his \"I have a dream\" speech. She protested racial separation at the hotels where she performed. She took action so that she and her musicians would be allowed to stay in those hotels. B1ack musicians at the time generally stayed in black neighborhoods. At the age of eighty, she said she did not have to act like a white woman that Hollywood hoped she would become. She said: \"I'm me, and I'm like nobody else.\" Lena Horne died in New York in 2010.

        "question": "Peter loved to shop used articles. Almost a month ago, he bought popular word game that used little pieces of wood with different letters on them. As he was purchasing it, the salesgirl said, \"Uh, look, the game box haven't even been opened yet. That might be worth some money. \" Peter examined the box, and, sure enough, it was completely covered in factory-sealed plastic. And he saw a date of 1973 on the back of the box. \"You should put that up for auction   on the Internet, and see what happens.\"the salesgirl said. \"Yes, you're right. People like something rare.\" Peter agreed, \"I can't imagine there being very many unopened boxes of this game still around 40 years later.\" \"Don't forget to tell me if you sell it.\" the salesgirl smiled. \"No problem.\" Peter said. After he got home, Peter went online to several auction websites looking for his game. But he couldn't find it. Then he typed in the name of the word game and hit Search. The search result was 543 websites containing information about the changes of the game. Over the years, the game had been produced using letters in different sizes and game boards in different colors. He also found some lists of game fans looking for various versions of the game. Peter emailed some of them, telling them what he had. Two weeks later, Peter went back to the shop. \"Hello. Do you still remember the unopened word game?\" The salesgirl looked at him for a second, then recognized him and said, \"Oh, hi!\" \"I've got something for you,\" Peter said. \"I sold the game and made $1,000. Thank you for your suggestion.\" He handed her three $ 100 bills. \"Wow!\" the salesgirl cried out. \"Thank you, I never expected it.\" What is the main theme of the story?",

        "question": "The rising sea waters caused by global warming have inspired a Russian architect to design a hotel that could be built on water as well as land.The eco-friendly \"Ark\" could be constructed in just a few months anywhere in the world, the designer says. It's called \"The Ark\",but looks more like a ship sitting upside down on the water.A new design by Russian architect A1exander Remizov challenges the tradition of land-based hotel and would provide a shelter in the future--should the world face a modern-day flood as described in the Bible. The building of the hotel could be fast and simple.\"Prefabricated section could be put together in three to four months,\" Remizov said. The versatile structure could be constructed in most corners of the earth, even in earthquake-prone areas.Constructing \"The Ark\"--which would include 14 000 square meters of living space---would cost roughly the same as building an energy-efficient house. The self-supporting structure would be built around a central post, connecting wind generators and heat pumps on its roof with the basement,where solar,wind,and thermal energy could be stored and turned into electricity. Remizov has designed the building without glass,choosing instead the lasting and self-cleaning foil that could defend itself against rough weather conditions.That foil would be fastened to metals,which would also collect rainwater.The building would also feature an indoor jungle, creating its microclimate.

        "question": "Indoor Plants As with any house guests,indoor plants require a certain amount of basic,regular attention if they are going to feel at home. The first consideration when purchasing plants is to make reasonably sure that they are suitable for the condition in which they are going to be housed. A general rule for most plans being brought indoors for the first time is to ensure that they have reasonable temperature of not less than 60 degrees Fahrenheit,a position out of cold air,safe from pets and not exposed to strong sunlight. Plants love company. When plants are growing together,they create an atmosphere of damp around themselves which is far more beneficial than hot dry conditions. A group of plants will also present a more pleasing picture and provide an opportunity for a creative arrangement. There is no secret to this. Just rely on your natural feeling for harmony. Watering and feeding plants are probably the two areas of care that are the least well understood,but,again,if you follow a few simple rules,your plants should do well. Cold Slightly warm water is therefore the answer. It is usually better to pour water on to the soil on the surface of the pot rather than put the water into the pot holder at the bottom. Avoid giving small amount of water at regular intervals- it is much better to wet the soil right through the pot in one go and then to allow it to dry noticeably before giving it a further watering. The majority of indoor plants will be in active growth from March until October,and during this time,the established ones will benefit from regular feeding. This may mean feeding with a weak liquid fertilizer  at each watering or at intervals of a week or ten days with fertilizer at a standard strength. It is important,however,to ensure that plants are not fed when growth is inactive,when the soil in the pot is dry,or too soon after the plants has been potted up. What's the benefit of plants growing together?",

        "question": "Coffee has a history dating back to at least the 9th century and has been a catalyst for social interaction across cultures and eras. Originally discovered in Ethiopia, coffee beans were brought into the Middle East by Arab traders, spreading to Egypt, Yemen, Persia, Turkey, and North Africa by the 15th century. Muslim merchants eventually brought the beans to the thriving port city of Venice, where they sold them to wealthy Italian buyers. Soon, the Dutch began importing and growing coffee in places like Java and Ceylon (largely through slave labor), and the British East India Trading Company was popularizing the beverage in England. Coffee spread across Europe and even reached America. Where there has been coffee, there has been the coffeehouse. From the 15th century Middle Eastern establishments where men gathered to listen to music, play chess, and hear recitations from works of literature, to Paris' Cafe le Procope where luminaries of the French Enlightenment such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and Diderot came to enjoy a hot cup of joe, coffeehouses have traditionally served as centers of social interaction, places where people can come to relax, chat, and exchange ideas. The modern coffee shop is modeled on the espresso and pastry-centered Italian coffeehouses that arose with the establishment of Italian-American immigrant communities in major US cities such as New York City's Little Italy and Greenwich Village, Boston's North End, and San Francisco's North Beach. New York coffee shops were often frequented by the Beats in the 1950's. It wasn't long before Seattle and other parts of the Pacific Northwest were developing coffee shops as part of a thriving counterculture scene. The Seattle-based Starbucks took this model and brought it into mainstream culture. Although coffeehouses today continue to serve their traditional purpose as lively social hubs in many communities, they have noticeably adapted to the times. Rediscovering their purpose as centers of information exchange and communication, many coffee shops now provide their customers with internet access and newspapers. It has become extremely common to see someone sitting at a Starbucks listening to music or surfing the web on his or her laptop. Coffee stores today also maintain a fairly identifiable, yet unique aesthetic: wooden furniture and plush couches, paintings and murals drawn on walls, and soft-lighting combine to give coffee shops the cozy feeling of a home away from home. Today, big business retail coffee shops are expanding quickly all over the world. Starbucks alone has stores in over 40 countries and plans to add more. Despite its popularity, Starbucks has been criticized and labeled by many as a blood-sucking corporate machine, driving smaller coffee shops out of business through unfair practices. This has even spawned an anti-corporate coffee counterculture, with those subscribing to this culture boycotting big business coffee chains. Increasingly popular coffee stores such as The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf are also giving Starbucks some stiff competition. In any case, it seems pretty clear that coffee has weaved itself into the fabric of our consumer-oriented culture. We can infer from the passage   _  .",

        "question": "A relationship is defined as a state of connectedness between people. Although in today's society with its crazy rhythm of everyday life, when people tend to live in thickly populated cities, spending most of their time in the office and hardly knowing their neighbor's name, we still find ourselves in some kinds of relationships-with friends, family, or colleagues. Family relationships are the first relationships people enter. Parents and relatives influence our emotional development by creating a model that we are sometimes bound to follow all our lives, often subconsciously  . In day-care, at school, then in the office we spend a lot of time among fellow students and co-workers. We learn to keep business relationships, to work in a team environment, then form smaller groups of like-minded people and finally select some of them as our friends. What is a true friendship? How does it start? Are we destined to become friends with certain people or can we actually plan whom to be friends with? \"Everybody's friend is nobody's.\" said Arthur Schopenhauer. Unlike a companionship based on belonging to the same team or group, friendship is a very personal and selective type of relationship. It calls for trust, sincerity, and emotional bonds. Sociologists believe that most people are looking for similarities in views, social status, and interests when choosing friends. No wonder that our friends are often people of the same age, sex, and education. Another important factor is joint activity and solidarity. This is the reason why many of us befriend our colleagues and other people who work in the same field. Most people would agree that a friend is someone who always listens and understands. Understanding in this context implies a lot of meanings-compassion, sympathy, and emotional closeness. It's a process in which your friend reads your emotional state, shares your feelings, identifies himself or herself with you. What is the best title of this passage?  _",

The first night was very hard for the players. When it was their turn to rest, they were too excited to fall asleep at once. On the second night,they fell asleep as soon as they stopped.Some of them had trouble with their feet and hands, but the only serious problem was a psychological one.

        "question": "About one million years ago, the Ice Age began. The Ice Age was a long period of time in which four great glaciers pushed southward to cover almost all the upper half of North America, and then melted away. Each glacier was a thick sheet of ice and snow that spread out from a center near what is now Hudson Bay in Canada. The winters were long, and the cool summers were too short to melt much of the ice and snow. The ever-growing sheet built up to a thickness of two miles at its center.    As all glaciers do, these great glaciers slid. They pushed down giant trees in their paths and scraped the earth bare of soil. Many animals moved farther south to escape. Others stayed and were destroyed.     When winters of little snow came, the summer cut into the edges of the ice sheets. As the glaciers melted, rocks soil and other things that had mixed with the ice and snow were left. New hills, lakes and rivers were formed.    The last of the great glaciers began its melting about 11, 000 years ago. Its melting formed the Great Lakes. These lakes today are little changed from their early sizes and shapes. The largest of the North American river systems was also influenced by the glaciers. This is the Mississippi-Missouri-Ohio system. These rivers were miles wide at first. Through the years they settled into  _ present channels. From the information in this passage we know that   _  .",

        "question": "Orris had title to Brownacre in fee simple. Without Orris' knowledge, Hull entered Brownacre in 1950 and constructed an earthen dam across a watercourse. The earthen dam trapped water that Hull used to water a herd of cattle he owned. After 12 years of possession of Brownacre, Hull gave possession of Brownacre to Burns. At the same time, Hull also purported to transfer his cattle and all his interests in the dam and water to Burns by a document that was sufficient as a bill of sale to transfer personal property but was insufficient as a deed to transfer real property. One year later, Burns entered into a lease with Orris to lease Brownacre for a period of five years. After the end of the five-year term of the lease, Burns remained on Brownacre for an additional three years and then left Brownacre. At that time Orris conveyed Brownacre by a quitclaim deed to Powell.

        "question": "A 14-year-old British student is packing for the next day of school: textbooks, notebooks, pens, 250 grams of flour, an egg and some cooking oil. Wait, what? It's not a joke. From September, cookery will be a compulsory   course for kids aged 7-14 in the UK. Primary school students will learn how to put things together and make simple, healthy food. At high school, students will then master a number of different meals. They will also learn some cooking skills including baking. Britain is sometimes known as a country with bad food and unhealthy eating habits. These new courses are part of the country's effort to bring healthy food back onto the table. \"One in four British families no longer has a table that everyone can eat around. One out of every two meals we eat is eaten alone. Only four out of ten of us enjoy eating meals with our children,\" British writer Joanna Blythman wrote in her book Bad Food Britain: How A Nation Ruined Its Appetite   in 2006. Instead, ready meals have become the first choice for many British kids, because their parents are often too busy to cook a proper meal. The Department for Education hopes that the cookery courses can introduce children to good food and reduce childhood _ . \"It's important that children can develop an interest and understanding of good food,\" said a spokesman for the department. \"We want to encourage them to develop a love of food and cooking that will stay with them as they grow up.

While I was excited about all the beautiful things around me, my husband walked into a shop.  I was left standing alone in the street. The women in this country are never alone. After fifteen minutes, I started feeling a little uneasy. A street man dressed in torn, ragged clothes was coming towards me. To tell the truth, I thought the worst at that moment. I thought he was a beggar who was coming to ask for money. As he was passing, he stopped and touched my shoulder. He looked directly at me and the enormous love shining through his eyes made me relaxed. He then asked, \"D' accord? D' accord?\" I nodded yes. And with his smile, calmness and those incredible peaceful loving eyes, I was moved for days, and my mind was filled with the memory of such a kind person.

He wished he hadn't come to the lake for the weekend. \"We're ready,\" Dad said as he came in from the porch. \" Grab your rod.\"  Alex turned away from the window and slowly picked up his fishing rod. \"Have fun!\" Mom said. \"Sure,\" said Alex, trying to make his voice bright. \"We should have done this before.\" Dad said. \"Let's catch a big one!\" Dad picked up his tackle   box, rod, and bait can from the porch. He clicked on the flashlight.     They walked down the hill toward the lake in the narrow beam of light. The only thing Alex could see was the circle of weeds and rocks at their feet, lit by the flashlight. Insect voices filled his ears---clicks, hums, buzzes, whines. Hundreds of bugs waited in the darkness to attack. \"Ow!\" he blurted as he felt a sting on his arm. \"Mosquitoes,\" Dad said. \"I have brought some spray   to keep them off.\"  When they reached the boat, Alex stumbled as he climbed over the side. \"I don't like this much,\" he said. \"It's so dark.\" Dad squeezed his shoulder. \"Don't worry. It's not as dark as you think. After a while your eyes will get used to the night.\" Suddenly something rushed past Alex's head. He gasped. \"What was that?\" \"Probably a bat,\" Dad said. How could Dad act as if it were nothing! \"Will bats be flying around our heads the whole time?\" \"This is their time to be out catching insects,\" Dad explained. \"They won't hurt you. They're too busy grabbing dinner.\" He pushed the boat off the gravel   and jumped in. Alex gazed back at the cabin. A square of light from the window glowed in the darkness.   Dad rowed to the middle of the lake and stopped. \"We'll just let the boat drift. Keep the flashlight in the bottom of the boat. The fish won't bite if they see light flashing around. When we've done baiting our hooks , we'll turn the light off.\" Leaning down to get closer to the light, Alex tried to thread a worm on his hook, but he couldn't seem to work his fingers right. So what if the worm was only partly on the hook? He didn't want to fish anyway. He didn't even want to be there. What does the sentence 'We should have done this before' mean?",

        "question": "Who is your role model? Normally the answer to this question would be anyone around you who you find truly inspiring. It could also be someone like J. K. Rowling or Martin Luther King Jr. who have proven to be strong and intelligent people. However, in today's world, stars are regarded as role models along with the heroes listed above, despite their intentions or actions. Teens attempt to imitate their actions for two major reasons. First, to be fashionable and accepted by popular culture, and second>>because stars' actions are so well documented by the media that it seems to grab our attention and turns it to following stars' lives. Much of the reports about stars is shocking and exhibits bad morals or lifestyles that aren't right for teenagers. In addition, almost everything stars do is described beyond truth to make a shocking story by taking it to the next level. However, teens must take responsibility for their actions. We can't always blame stars for influencing us. Only you have control over yourself and only you choose to do something. Our bodies and actions are in the hands of no one else. Now, who ever said stars are role models? Whether they choose to be or not, stars set examples as soon as they step into the spotlight. With reporters following and recording every move they make, it is impossible not to be watched and then be imitated. These people influence, teens whether or not they want to. Why should someone who doesn't want to be setting an example set one? So,should we look up to them or to people who are true and good role models? It's our responsibility as teens to know right from wrong, and it's time for us to take responsibility for our actions. In doing so,we will lean toward those inspiring people that want to be setting an example, and follow in their steps to be like them.

        "question": "A written contract was entered into between Bouquet, a financier-investor, and Vintage Corporation, a winery and grape-grower. The contract provided that Bouquet would invest $1,000,000 in Vintage for its capital expansion and, in return, that Vintage, from grapes grown in its famous vineyards, would produce and market at least 500,000 bottles of wine each year for five years under the label \"Premium VintageBouquet.\" The contract included provisions that the parties would share equally the profits and losses from the venture and that, if feasible, the wine would be distributed by Vintage only through Claret, a wholesale distributor of fine wines. Neither Bouquet nor Vintage had previously dealt with Claret. Claret learned of the contract two days later from reading a trade newspaper. In reliance thereon, he immediately hired an additional sales executive and contracted for enlargement of his wine storage and display facility. \"For this question only, assume the following facts. Amicusbank lent Bouquet $200,000 and Bouquet executed a written instrument providing that Amicusbank \"is entitled to collect the debt from my share of the profits, if any, under the Vintage-Bouquet contract.\" Amicusbank gave prompt notice of this transaction to Vintage.

        "question": "It was the Year from Hell - the dog died, my marriage of 24 years ended, and my house burned down. I had moved into a new rented house with my youngest son after my husband and I divorced. We'd been in the house just six weeks. I went to a dinner party one night, and as I drove home near, I saw smoke rising into the sky. I wondered whether it was my house. Then I turned the corner, and sure enough, it was my house. My son and I stayed with a friend for a couple of nights. Then my friend Gail heard about the fire, called me up, and said, \"Come and move into my house. I have seven bedrooms and five bathrooms - plenty of space for you and your son.\" Gail had three kids at home, but there was still plenty of room for me and my son, Sutton. Little did I know that her offer of a temporary place to stay would turn into a living arrangement that lasted two and a half years. We were two single mothers. Gail and I spent the next couple of years sorting out a lot of things together. After we moved in, I soon began to look for a permanent place to live in. Gail said, \"Please don't leave. I've never had so much freedom!\" Having me in the house meant someone to help take care of her kids, someone to share cooking and gardening, and someone to share day-to-day life. She loved having me there, and I loved being there. So we stayed. It was an important chapter in my life. We both needed time to heal from our divorces. It was a time of deeper insight and spiritual growth for both of us. Gail's generosity was more than anyone could expect from a friend. I am eternally grateful to have a friend like Gail. I'm also grateful for the lessons I learned from the fire and the other losses that came so suddenly, so fast. Much to my surprise, I found gratitude among the ashes. I was tested serious trial by fire. But, like a phoenix, I rose from the ashes strong and whole. I would not be the person I am today if not for that Year from Hell.

        "question": "Women consistently lie on social networking sites such as Facebook or Twitter to make their lives appear more exciting, a survey has found. The survey was asked to carried out by Pencourage, a new anonymous \"diary-style\" social media website. Researchers found that at least one in four women exaggerated or twisted what they are doing on social media once a month. The survey of 2000 women found they mostly pretended to be out on the town, when in fact they are home alone, and beautify about an exotic holiday or their job. The most common reasons for women to write _ included worrying their lives would seem \" boring\", jealousy at seeing other people's more exciting posts and wanting to impress their friends and acquaintances. Psychologists suggested that as people attempt to stay connected on social media, they can in fact be left more isolated. They also said that the more we try to make our lives seem perfect, the less perfect we feel. According to the OnePoll survey, one third of women surveyed admitted to dishonesty on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter at some stage. Almost one in four admitted to lying or exaggerating about key aspects of their life online between one and three times a month while almost one in 10 said they lied more than once a week. Nearly 30 percent of women lied about \"doing something when I am home alone\", almost a quarter overstated their alcohol consumption while one in five were not truthful about their holiday activities or their jobs. Almost one in five women even lied about their \"relationship status\". \"We work very hard presenting ourselves to the world online, pretending and attempting to be happy all the time which is exhausting and ultimately unfulfilling,\" said Dr Michael Sinclair, a leading British consultant psychologist. \"Leaving out the less desirable imperfections of our lives from the conversations with our 'friends online leads to less opportunity to feel empathized with, resulting in a greater sense of disconnection from others. \" According to the passage, women tend to lie on social networking sites because  _  .",

        "question": "When I was superintendent of schools in Palo Alto, California, Polly Tyner, the president of our board of trustees , wrote a letter that was printed in the Palo Alto Times. Polly's son, Jim, had great difficulty in school. He was classified as educationally handicapped and required a great deal of patience on the part of his parents and teachers. But Jim was a happy kid with a great smile that lit up the room. His parents acknowledged his academic difficulties, but always tried to help him see his strengths so that he could walk with pride. Shortly after Jim finished high school, he was killed in a motorcycle accident. After his death, his mother submitted this letter to the newspaper. Today we buried our 20-year-old son. He was killed instantly in a motorcycle accident on Friday night. How I wish I had known when I talked to him last that it would be the last time. If I had only known I would have said, \"Jim, I love you and I'm so very proud of you.\" I would have taken the time to count the many blessings he brought to the lives of the many who loved him. I would have taken time to appreciate his beautiful smile, the sound of his laughter, his genuine love of people. When you put all the good attributes on the scale  and you try to balance all the irritating _ such as the radio which was always too loud, the haircut that wasn't to our liking, the dirty socks under the bed, etc., the irritations don't amount to much. I won't get another chance to tell my son all I would have wanted him to hear, but, other parents, you do have a chance. Tell your young people what you would want them to hear if you knew it would be your last conversation. The last time I talked to Jim was the day he died. He called me to say, \"Hi, Mom! I just called to say I love you. Got to go to work. Bye.\" He gave me something to treasure forever. If there is any purpose at all to Jim's death, maybe it is to make others appreciate more of life and to have people, especially families, take the time to let each other know just how much we care. You may never have another chance. Do it today! The passage is most probably entitled  _  .",

        "question": "Before the law sits a gatekeeper.To this gatekeeper comes a man from the country who asks to gain entry into the law.But the gatekeeper says that he cannot grant him entry at the moment.The man thinks about it and then asks if he will be allowed to come in sometime later on.\"It is possible,\" says the gatekeeper,\"but not now.\" 1The gate to the law stands open,as always,and the gatekeeper walks to the side,so the man bends over in order to see through the gate into the inside.When the gatekeeper notices that,he laughs and says:  _  The man from the country has not expected such difficulties: the law should always be accessible for everyone,he thinks,but as he now looks more closely at the gatekeeper in his fur coat,at his large pointed nose and his long,thin,black Tartar's beard,he decides that it would be better to wait until he gets permission to go inside.The gatekeeper gives him a stool and allows him to sit down at the side in front of the gate.There he sits for days and years.He makes many attempts to be let in,and he wears the gatekeeper out with his requests.The gatekeeper often interrogates him briefly,questioning him about his homeland and many other things,but they are indifferent questions,the kind great men put,and at the end he always tells him once more that he cannot let him inside yet.The man,who has equipped himself with many things for his journey,spends everything,no matter how valuable,to win over the gatekeeper.The latter takes it all but,as he does so,says,\"I am taking this only so that you do not think you have failed to do anything.\" 2 During the many years the man observes the gatekeeper almost continuously.He forgets the other gatekeepers,and this first one seems to him the only barrier for entry into the law.He curses the unlucky circumstance,in the first years thoughtlessly and out loud; later,as he grows old,he only mumbles to himself.He becomes childish and,since in the long years studying the gatekeeper he has also come to know the fleas  in his fur collar,he even asks the fleas to help him persuade the gatekeeper.Finally his eyesight grows weak,and he does not know whether things are really darker around him or whether his eyes are merely deceiving him.But he recognizes now in the darkness a ray of light which breaks out of the gateway to the law.Now he no longer has much time to live. Before his death he gathers in his head all his experiences of the entire time up into one question which he has not yet put to the gatekeeper.He waves to him,since he can no longer lift up his stiffening body.The gatekeeper has to bend way down to him,for the great difference has changed things considerably to the disadvantage of the man.3 \"You are insatiable .\" \"Everyone strives after the law,\" says the man,\"so how is it that in these many years no one except me has requested entry?\" The gatekeeper sees that the man is already dying and,in order to reach his diminishing sense of hearing,he shouts at him,\"Here no one else can gain entry,since this entrance was assigned only to you.I'm going now to close it.\" 4 What may be the title of the novel?",

        "question": "Campers Gene and Marie Marsden took pride in being good citizens when in the wild. While driving miles to the Green River Lakes area, they taught their children what they had learned in the bear safety handbook put out by the Bridger-Teton Forest Service. Mr. and Mrs. Marsden did their best to keep a tidy camp. As the handbook had said to hang all food at least ten feet off the ground and four feet out from the trees, they did that and locked their food in their trailer  at night. It was already dark when they went to bed, but they _ the campsite with flashlights, making sure nothing was left out. Following the bear book's advice, they slept a hundred yards from where they cooked their food, and kept the car near their tents, separated from the trailer, which they left up at the other camp. The Marsdens liked having their dog Spike on guard. But on the first night, Spike would not stop barking. When Marie Marsden pulled the tent open and shone her flashlight, she saw a young bear. They all piled into the car and drove quickly down the path, calling out of the window to Spike and abandoning the trailer. They drove to a pay phone and called a Fish and Game Department guard, who identified the bear by the white ring of the fur the Marsdens had seen around his neck. The authorities informed the Marsdens that the bear was a young male that they'd been keeping an eye on. The next morning, the Marsdens heard helicopters circling over the mountain and wondered if it might have something to do with the bear. After spending the night in the public campground, they drove back to their site. Wandering the area in search of clues, Marie came to a stop below a tall tree. She slapped her head and shouted, \"Oh no!\" \"What is it?\" Gene asked. Marie pointed at the ground where Spike's dog food bowl lay upside down. A week after their return home, the Marsdens read the headline in their local paper. \"Bear Killed in Wind Rivers.\" According to the article, the Fish and Game Department had shot the young bear because, having been rewarded for invading  a human campsite, it would likely to do so again. The Marsdens knew they had been lucky in the encounter, yet much to their shame and sadness, they also knew that the bear had not. What do we know about the Marsdens?",

        "question": "How long you live has a lot to do with your environment and lifestyle, but exceptional long life may have even more to do with your genes. For the first time, researchers have discovered a genetic recipe that accurately predicts who may live to 100 and beyond. Analysis shows that 90% of the participants who lived to 100 had at least one of the signature genetic clusters . Dr. Thomas Perls at the Boston University School of Medicine said, \"We realize this is a complex genetic puzzle. There is a long way for us to go to understand how the integration of these genes--not just with themselves but with environmental factors--is playing a role in this long life puzzle.\" Perls has studied many factors that contribute to long life, and he is the first to acknowledge that living longer isn't likely to be simply a matter of genes. His previous work has shown, for example, that among most elderly people who live into their 70s and 80s, about 70% can owe their long life to environmental factors such as not smoking; eating a healthy, low-fat, low-calorie diet; and remaining socially engaged and mentally active throughout life. It seems clear that those who live extremely long are benefiting from a special DNA. In fact, Perls believes that the older a person gets, the more likely it is that his or her genes are contributing to those extended years. Which of the following is FALSE according to the text?",

Recently, the American star won Best Actress at this year's Academy Awards for her role in the film The Silver Linings Playbook. According to Time magazine's Richard Corliss, Lawrence is that rare young actress who \"lends a mature intelligence to any role\". Though Lawrence has found great success through her big screen work, Lawrence wasn't sure what she really liked doing before the age of 14. She thought she'd go to college and maybe find a career as a doctor or a travel agent. Lawrence's two brothers were star athletes and one of them was a straight-A student. Unlike them, she suffered through school, never quite finding where she belonged. However, during a trip to New York, Lawrence suddenly realized that she wanted to be an actress. When she was enjoying the beautiful city, a model seeker asked if he could take her picture, and the next day he called her in for an audition  . \"I read the script and it was the first time I had that feeling like I understand this,\" Lawrence said. \"Within 20 minutes, in the cab ride from the hotel room, I decided I didn't want to be a model. In fact, I wanted to be an actress.\" Having appreciated this young lady's performance, the agency was so impressed with her reading that they signed her on the spot. But she insisted on finishing high school so she could give her full attention to her acting career. Lawrence burst onto the Hollywood scene last year with The Hunger Games, which established her as the highest-grossing   female action hero of all time.

        "question": "When you close your eyes and try to think of the shape of your own body, what you imagine (or rather, what you feel) is quite different from what you see when you open your eyes and look in the mirror. The image you feel is much vaguer  than the one you see. And if you lie still, it is quite hard to imagine yourself as having any particular size or shape. When you move, when you feel the weight of your arms and legs and the natural resistance of the objects around you, the \"felt\" image of yourself starts to become clearer. It is almost as if it were created by your own actions and the feelings they cause. The image you create for yourself has rather strange proportions ; certain parts feel much larger than they look. If you get a hole in one of your teeth, it feels enormous; you are often surprised by how small it looks when you inspect it in the mirror. Although the \"felt\" image may not have the shape you see in the mirror, it is much more important. It is the image through which you recognize your physical existence in the world. In spite of its strange proportions, it is all one piece, and since it has a consistent right and left and a top and bottom, it allows you to locate new feelings when they occur. It allows you to find your nose in the dark and point to a pain. If the felt image is damaged for any reason--if it is cut in half or lost as it often is after certain strokes  which wipe out recognition of one entire side -these tasks become almost impossible. What is more, it becomes hard to make sense of one's own visual appearance. If one half of the \"felt\" image is wiped out or injured, the patient stops recognizing the affected part of his body. It is hard for him to find the location of feelings on that side, and, although he feels the doctor's touch, he locates it as being on the undamaged side.

        "question": "Since the invention of Guitar Hero and similar computer games, it is no longer necessary to imagine what it would be like to play along with the Beatles--you can come together with them in the virtual world. Bill Wyman, former bass player  in the Rolling Stones, has pointed out that music video games discourage kids from learning to play real instruments. My own opinion suggest quite opposite. Last year, I bought Guitar Hero III for our 14-year-old son, Jack. Jack quickly mastered the process and entered an intense period of playing the game. A few months later, while I was away on tour, a couple of his friends came around with a real electric guitar. Playing Guitar Hero had taught them how to play along the track. Now they wanted to see if they could apply that to the real thing. Jack's friends taught him how to play along to his favorite songs using just his index finger  on the bass string. He got it right away. Guitar Hero had helped him over the first difficulty for guitar players--how to strum  the strings with one hand while making chord  shapes with the other. He never plays Guitar Hero now, preferring to rock out in the garage with his mates. Despite my attempts at getting him to learn an instrument, it was Guitar Hero that taught him the basics of playing and built up his confidence to the extent that he was able to make a recognizable sound the first time he played it. So let's not complain about a game that encourages kids to become music fans and, in our son's case, gives them the basic skills needed to learn how to play guitar.

        "question": "In many businesses, computers have largely replaced paperwork, because they are fast, flexible, and do not make mistakes. As one banker said, \"Unlike humans, computers never have a bad day.\" And they are honest. Many banks advertise that their transactions are \"untouched by human hands\" and therefore safe from human temptation. Obviously, computers have no reason to steal money. But they also have no conscience, and the growing number of computer crimes shows they can be used to steal. Computer criminals don't use guns. And even they are caught, it is hard to punish them because there are no witnesses and often no evidence. A computer cannot remember who used it: it simply does what it is told. The head teller at a New York City Bank used a computer to steal more than one and a half billion dollars in just four years. No one noticed this theft because he moved the money from one account to another. Each time a customer he had robbed questioned the balance in his account, the teller claimed a computer error, then replaced the missing money from someone else's account. This man was caught only because he was a gambler. When the police broke up an illegal gambling operation, his name was in the records. Some employees use the computer's power to get revenge on employers they consider unfair. Recently, a large insurance company fired its computer-tape librarian for reasons that involved her personal rather than her professional life. She was given thirty days' notice. In those thirty days, she erased all the company's computerized records. Most computer criminals have been minor employees. Now police wonder if this is \"the tip of the iceberg\". As one official says, \"I have the feeling that there is more crime out there than we are catching. What we are seeing now is all so poorly done. I wonder what the real experts are doing--the ones who really know how a computer works.\" The author uses the case of the head teller to show  _  .",

        "question": "Special trees that grow faster, fight pollution, produce better wood, and even sense chemical attacks are being planted by scientists in the US. When 40 per cent of Hawaii's US$14 million-a-year papaya  industry was destroyed by a virus five years ago, work began on creating genetically engineered trees. Researchers successfully introduced seeds that were designed to resist the virus.Since then, more and more people have been testing genetically engineered trees.Some researchers put special bacteria into trees to help them grow faster and produce better wood.Others are trying to create trees that can clean polluted soil.Meanwhile fruit farmers are looking for trees that are strong enough to resist worms, and paper companies want trees that produce more wood and therefore more paper. The Pentagon   even gave the researchers US$500,000 this year after they developed a pine tree that changes its colours if it senses a chemical attack.So far, the poplar, eucalyptus  , apple and coffee trees are among those being engineered.All this can be done today because we have a better understanding of tree genomes  . However, some people fear that the genetically engineered trees will cause dangerous results.They are worried that the new trees will breed with natural species and change the balance of the forest environment. \"It could be destructive,\" said Jim Diamond, an environmentalist. \"Trees are what is left of our natural environment and home to many endangered species.\" But researchers insist that science could give nature a fighting chance against both natural and man-made dangers.They hope to answer the critics by stopping the new trees from breeding, so their effect on the environment can be controlled.

        "question": "Sharing not only exists between humanbeings.As is often seen that some plants and anima1s live close together, and they depend on each other. They are usually very different from their partner, and yet all live easier lives because of each other. It is nature's idea of sharing.  An example of a partnership is the shark and pilot fish. The pilot fish is a little fish only about nine inches long. He would be. helpless if he hung around by himself in the mighty ocean. He makes up for his size with his smartness. He cleverly swims along beside the shark. When the shark eats, the pilot fish gets the leftovers. And the pilot fish needn't worry about his safety. The shark also gets benefits from this relationship. The pilot fish cleans food scraps and insects from the shark's hide.  Another example of depending on each other is the sea anemone  and striped clown fish. The sea anemone looks like a flower and has petals  that contain poisonous stinging cells. When small fish swim into the petals, the anemone traps and paralyzes   them. However,the striped clown fish is able to swim into the poisonous petals without being harmed. When he is in danger, he quickly swims into the sea anemone and is unable to be seen by his enemies. To pay for his safety,the clown fish brings food to the anemone. He also guides other fish into the anemone's deadly trap.  Large mammals such as the ox, antelope, rhinoceroses and African buffalo form such a relationship with the red-billed ox-peeker. They provide daily meals for the bird. In fact the bird eats insects. The various large mammals act as a restaurant with a varied menu for the ox-peeker. What do they get in return from the bird? Free beauty treatments!  Some plants live together in a beneficial relationship of symbiosis. The fungus   does not have chlorophyll   that plants need to make food. However, green algae does contain chlorophyll. It is, therefore, able to feed the fungus along with itself. But nothing is free! The fungus repays it by protecting the algae. Since it takes in and stores water, it can provide the algae with a non-ending water supply. To repay the sea anemone, the striped clown fish  _  .",

        "question": "Do you usually go Dutch(AA) when you take someone out to dinner? Do you expect your date to pay for the whole meal? Many people say that as long as there's love, money doesn't matter much. But this might change when the relationship gets serious and it is related to the money borrowed from the bank, the family present accounts and debt. A survey among 8 million couples in the UK suggested that 44% of married couples don't know exactly what their partner earns. An astonishing 23% actively try to keep their finances  secret from their partners. About 38% of them are open to each other. Another 12% refuses to tell the truth. British relationship expert Russell says: \"It's very difficult to talk about money. Often there's guilt, there's shame. To start those conversations is difficult. Money can be about how we value ourselves, how we feel valued. It's not just a simple case of talking about hard cash.\" So if you are in a couple, it might be a good idea to check if you both are on the same page about money before bills pile up on the kitchen table and love flies out of the window. When moving in together, couples should not only talk about their personal habits but also about their financial ones. Russell has a word of advice: \"Accept the fact that in your relationship you might do money differently - there might be a spender or a saver. It's very attractive if your partner does things differently to say they're wrong. Do it differently but plan it well.\" And now, back to that date. Would you be bored with someone who was attractive but expected you to pay the bill by yourself? There's food for thought. Which of the following can be the best title of the passage?",

        "question": "In 1901, the citizens of Colorado Springs in the USA decided to collect everyday items and to seal  them in a special box. The box was marked \"To be opened after midnight, December 31st, AD 2000\",and was kept in the Colorado College Library. One hundred years later, on the appointed  day, 300 people gathered to watch the opening of the box. Many in the crowd were the descendants  of people who had placed things inside the box. When the box was opened after midnight, the things inside the box were in very good condition. There were newspapers, photos, diaries, name cards, family trees, books and lots of letters, including one written by Theodore Roosevelt, who became the President of the USA later that year. One of Roosevelt's friends lived in Colorado Springs at that time. Many of the letters were written to their descendants. They describe the hopes that the people of 1901 had for the people of the next century. At that time, Colorado Springs had just a few thousand people. Now nearly half a million people live there. Colorado College Library has scanned the materials and put them on a website. Cecil Muller, whose grandfather had placed a collection of postcards in the box, said that the time capsule was a great treasure. \"This is a wonderful educational resource .

It tries to bring something new by introducing more cultural features   related to dishes, such as eating habits and wonderful stories about food. It's said that more than 100 million Chinese people are watching the program. Most Chinese people regard this program as more than just the regular food shows. They see it as an amazing documentary providing a special view of Chinese as well as the relations between people and food , between people and society. On the other hand, the documentary also stimulates   Chinese people's consumption  . Taobao, one of China's biggest online shopping sites, reports that the search on food items that were introduced by the documentary has increased to 4 million times in one week, and sales have increased to 5.82 million. To get enough good stories, the production team spent three months doing research and interviews in about 60 cities before they started making the documentary last July. Filming lasted about nine months.

        "question": "Wikipedia: The Online Know-It-All If you want to find out a piece of information about anything, the best place to search for it is Wikipedia. The name \"Wikipedia\" is from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning \"quick\". This online encyclopedia   is written by thousands of people around the world. Anyone with Internet access can write, add or make changes to Wikipedia articles if he or she finds it incorrect or not well written. In this way, people who know a lot about a certain subject can write about it even if they are not university professors. But contributions cannot damage Wikipedia because many experienced editors are watching pages and techies   can write editing programs to keep track of or correct bad edits. Where there are disagreements on how to present facts, editors work together to arrive at an article that fairly represents current expert opinion on the subject. Wikipedia is quite different from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, it is continually created and updated, with articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. What's more, Wikipedia includes articles written in about 285 languages. This fact makes it one of the few websites on the Internet that are truly international. It was started in 2001 by Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales, as a free online English-language encyclopedia project. Since its creation, it has grown rapidly into one of the largest reference websites, attracting nearly 500 million unique visitors monthly. There are more than 77,000 active contributors working on more than 22,000,000 articles in different languages. As of today, there are 4,396,866 articles in English. So, if you are looking for some information, why not try Wikipedia? It's free, multilingual,and informative. From the passage we know that   _  .",

        "question": "You may not be aware, but digital currency   is a big part of the Internet world. QQ Coins can buy you accessories   for your QQ images. More importantly, a new digital currency, Bitcoin, is bringing the world's commerce online. If you're traveling, you can spend Bitcoins at restaurants and hotels listed at BitcoinTravel.com. In China, Bitcoins can be used to buy goods at about 134 online shops on Taobao.  And at a cafe named 2nd Place in Beijing, you can even buy fresh coffee with Bitcoins. So what makes Bitcoin so attractive to investors? First of all, the Bitcoin system is not controlled by anyone. One central authority cannot make policies to change the value of Bitcoins. The fixed amount of Bitcoins also means they cannot lose value through inflation , as all forms of paper money have done over time. In addition, accounts in the Bitcoin system are anonymous and transparent. Users can set up an account easily and track every Bitcoin. All of these features seem to make Bitcoins immune  from loss, but that is not entirely true. \"The value of Bitcoins can vary wildly as no central government makes the price of them steady. If the value drops suddenly, investors cannot get any compensation ,\" Zhao Qingming, a senior researcher at China Construction Bank, told China Economic Weekly. And Bitcoins, unlike company shares, are not backed by any tangible funds, which also adds to their risk. While China will not recognize the digital currency anytime soon, Xinhua said, lawmakers and officials at a hearing on Nov. 18 in the US made positive comments about Bitcoin. Ben Bernanke, outgoing chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Washington Post that \"these types of creations, such as Bitcoin... may hold long-term promise, particularly if its system promotes a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.\" What is the disadvantage of Bitcoin?",

        "question": "Wild animals are our friends, but many of them are getting fewer and fewer. We should try to protect them. The four animals below are now in danger. Tibetan Antelopes Tibetan antelopes   are medium-sized animals. They mainly feed on grass. They are usually found in groups of about 20. They are killed for their wool, which is warm, soft and fine and can be made into expensive clothes. Although people can get the wool without killing the animals, people simply kill them before taking the wool. The number of them is dropping year by year. There are less than 75,000 Tibetan antelopes left in the world, down from a million 50 years ago. Golden Monkeys       Golden monkeys are mainly found in Sichuan, Gansu, Shanxi provinces and Shengnongjia mountainous area of Hubei Province. Golden monkeys have golden-orange fur. They move around in the daytime, usually in groups of as many as 100 to 200 heads, or 20 to 30 heads. They feed on fruits and young leaves of bamboos. But people are destroying the environment where they live. Trees and bamboos are disappearing, so golden monkeys have less and less to eat. Elephans ks5u Elephants are very big and strong. They are bigger than any other animals on land. They are grey and have long trunks and tusks. They have poor eyesight, but very good hearing and smell. They can lift heavy things and break down branches with their trunks. Elephants are very friendly towards each other and towards their neighbours. Normally, they live in a group for many years. Young male elephants do not leave the group until they are about 12 years old. Now, there are very few elephants in the world. The number of them is becoming smaller and smaller because their living areas are used for farming. Also, people hunt them for their tusks. Wolves Wolves are not very big. They have grey fur. Wolves have very good eyesight, hearing and smell. Wolves' food is vavious. They eat animals, insects and snails. They are friendly to each other and never attack people. They do not kill for fun.

Animals that do not lay eggs often have fewer babies. Animals lay many eggs because other animals may eat the babies. However, even though some of their babies are eaten, they will still have some more to continue their family. Some animals that lay eggs do not take care of their young. Turtles come onto the beach and dig holes. Then they put their eggs in the sand and leave. A turtle mother can lay as many as 150 eggs. When the babies come out of the eggs, they must find their own way to the ocean. They must learn how to live on their own. Many young turtles get eaten by other animals. Most eggs have an outside shell that keeps the growing animal inside safe. The egg shell also keeps the young animal from drying out. After the animal is fully developed, it comes out of the egg.

        "question": "For centuries ,the only form of written correspondence was the letter .Letters were ,and are ,sent by some form of postal service ,the history of which goes back a long way. Indeed ,the Egyptians began sending letters from about 2000 BC, as did the Chinese a thousand years later.        Of course ,modern postal services now are much more developed and faster ,depending as they do on cars and planes for delivery .Yet they are still too slow for some people to send urgent documents and letters.        The invention of the fax machine increased the speed of delivering documents even more .When you send a fax ,you are sending a copy of a piece of correspondence to someone by telephone service .It was not until the early 1980s that such a service was developed enough for businesses to be able to fax documents to each other.        The fax service is still very much in use when copies of documents require to be sent ,but ,as a way of fast correspondence, it has been largely taken the place of by email. Email is used to describe messages sent from one computer user to another.        There are advantages and disadvantages with emails. If you send someone and email, then he will receive it extremely quickly. Normal postal services are rather slow as far as speed of delivery is concerned.        However ,if you write something by email ,which you might later regret ,and send it immediately ,there is no chance for second thoughts. At least ,if you are posting a letter you have to address and seal the envelope and take it to the post box .There is plenty of time to change your mind. The message is think before you email!

In an open letter on her official web site,Lavigne responds to public views that her hit single\"girlfriend,\"from her 1atest album The Best Damn Thing,was copied form a 1979 song  called\"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\"by a new wave group called the Rubinoos.The group's  songwrieers,Tommy Dunbar and James Gangwer,have gone to 1aw against the singer.\"I had never heard this song in my life and their claim is based on 5 words,\"Lavigne blogs.\"A11 songs share similar song words and emotions.As humans we speak one language.\"In fact,Lavigne 1ists several songs,which are similar in words.\"Simply,I have been falsely accused of copying their song.I have done nothing wrong and there is no sense of their claim,\"she writes. The Rubinoos'accusation is not the first time that Lavigne's song writing practices have  been called into question.In a recent interview with Performing Song-writing Magazine,  Canasian singer--songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk discusses cooperating with Lavigne.And she  te11s the magazine that she gave Lavignc the song \"contagious\",which.she claims,appears on The Best Damn Thing.On the album,however.The song is owned only by Lavigne and the song writing partner Evan Tauenfeld. \"I was going to be a bigger person and not reply when I read Chantal Kreviazuk's article,\"  Lavigne writes.\"Our songs have no similarities or opposites meanings,i.e.different wods,different tunes,different styles.There are hundreds of songs out there with the title'Contagious'.\" Lavigne adds:\"I am not going to sit here and defend my writing skil1s.I  don't have to prove anything to anyone.I know who I am and what I have done and succeeded  in and no one can take that away from me.\" The best title of the passage should be  _  .",

        "question": "Scientists found that sleeping considerably improves our creativity. After taking a nap people are able to think faster and put more imagination into their thinking. Besides, if we dream, the thinking abilities are improved even more. Researchers consider that sleeping on a problem in most cases leads to elucidation . They say when a person enters a phase called Rapid Eye Movement (REM) during sleep, _ increases the effect. Such phase takes place right before we awake and according to scientists it helps our brain make links between unrelated subjects. In the study, led by Professor Sara Mednick, scientists made a conclusion that the REM was \"important for assimilating  new information into past experience\" in order to find solutions to creative problems. Prof. Mednick is a psychiatrist at the University of California. Her study involved the analysis of 77 adults. Each participant was given several word-associated creative tasks. All tasks were given in the morning, with participants being shown a number of groups of 3 words, for example: cookie, heart and sixteen. They were asked to come up with a word that would be associated with all three given terms--like sweet. Sometime later, after some participants were allowed to sleep, they were asked to perform the same tasks and some new ones. It is worth mentioning that while some people slept, researchers used brain scans to see the type of sleep each participant entered. When given the same tasks, participants, who took a nap, were able to give more varied solutions, some of which were much better than they gave earlier. But when given new tasks, researchers found that those who entered REM sleep had a 40 percent better result compared to the performance they showed in the morning.

        "question": "Want to be a volunteer for Beijing Olympics in 2008? Recently, the recruiting started. The recruiting of Beijing Olympics Volunteer starts from Aug 28, 2006 to end of March 2008. Stage 1: Beijing Volunteers From August 28, 2006, the program opens to applicants in Beijing (and Beijing only). Stage 2: China Volunteers From Dec, 2006, people from outside Beijing can submit their application. Stage 3: Overseas Volunteers By March 2007, people from outside China (including in other countries) can apply for volunteering in Olympics 2008. The Program Travel, hotel are not provided. Only working meal is available for volunteers (makes sense, isn't it?) If you have any questions, just call Olympics Volunteer hotline: +86-10-12308 According to news, 100k college students have applied for the position after three days of recruiting. 50,000 to 100,000 volunteers are needed for the game. If you want to participate, just call the number and ask more questions about the program. However, my guess is, to be admitted to the program is not easy. Who has the most time to apply for volunteering in Olympics 2008 ?",

        "question": "Have you thought about what you want people to say about you after you're gone? Can you hear the voice saying,\"He was a great man.\"or\"She really will be missed.\"What else do they say? One of the phenomena of life is to engage in a work that will last long after death. Isn't that a lot like investing all your money so that future generations can get interest on it? Perhaps, yet if you look deep in your own heart, you'll find something drives you to make this kind of contribution -- something drives every human being to find a purpose that lives on after death. Do you hope to memorialize your name? Have a name that is whispered with reverent awe? Do you hope to have your face carved upon 50 feet of granite rock ? Is the answer really that simple? Is the purpose of lifetime contribution an ego-driven desire for a mortal  being to have an immortal name or is it something more? A child alive today will die tomorrow. A baby that has the potential to be the next Einstein will die from complications at birth.The circumstances of life are not set in stone. We are not all meant to live life through to old age. We've grown to perceive life as a full cycle with a certain number of years in between. If all of those years aren't lived out, it's a tragedy. A tragedy comes about because a human's potential has never been realized. A tragedy comes about because a spark was snuffed out before it ever became a flame. By virtue of inhabiting a body we accept these risks. We expose our mortal flesh to the laws of the physical environment around us. The trade-off isn't so bad when you think about it. The problem comes when we construct mortal fantasies of what life should be like. When life doesn't conform to our fantasy we grow upset, frustrated, or depressed. We are alive; let us live. We have the ability to experience; let us experience. We have the ability to learn; let us learn. The meaning of life can be grasped in a moment. A moment so brief that it often evades our perception. What meaning stands behind the dramatic unfolding of life? What single truth can we grasp and hang onto for dear life when all other truths around us seem to fade with time? These moments are strung together in a series we call events. These events are strung together in a series we call life. When we seize the moment and bend it to our will, a will driven by the spirit deep inside us, then we have discovered the meaning of life, a meaning for us that shall go on long after we depart this Earth. Why are people devoted to a career lasting long even after their death?",

        "question": "Napping  after learning something new could help improve your memory...as long as you dream, scientists say. They found people who dream about a new task do it better on waking than those who do not sleep or do not dream. Volunteers were asked to learn the layout  of a 3D computer maze  so they could find their way several hours later. Those allowed to take a nap and who also remembered dreaming of the task, found their way to a landmark   quicker. The researchers think the dreams are a sign that unconscious  parts of the brain are working hard to process information about the task. Dr. Robert Stickgold of Harvard Medical School, said dreams may be a marker that the brain is working on the same problem at many levels. Study tips Co-author Dr. Erin Wamsley said the study suggests our non-conscious brain works on the things that it deem   are the most important. \"Every day we are gathering lots of information and new experiences,\" she said. \"It would seem that our dreams are asking the question, \"How do I use this information to inform  my life?\" The scientists say there may be ways to use this phenomenon for improving learning and memory.

        "question": "Soon, you' re going to have to move out!\" cried my neighbor upon seeing the largest tomato plant known to mankind, or at least known in my neighborhood. One tiny 9-inch plant, bought for $1. 25 in the spring, has already taken over much of my rose bed, covering much of other plants, and is well on its way to the front door. Roses require a good deal of care, and if it weren't for the pleasure they give, it wouldn' t be worth the work. As it is, I have a garden full of sweet-smelling roses for most of the year. Bushes must be pruned in early spring, leaving ugly woody branches until the new growth appears a few weeks later. It was the space available in the garden that led me into planting just one little tomato plant. A big mistake. Soil conditions made just perfect for roses turn out to be even more perfect for tomatoes. The daily watering coupled with full sun and regular fertilizing have turned the little plant into a tall bush. The cage I placed around it as the plant grew has long disappeared under the thick leaves. Now the task I face in harvesting the fruit is twofold. First, I have to find the red ones among the leaves, which means I almost have to stand on my head, and once found I have to reach down and under, pick the tomatoes and withdraw my full fist without dropping the prize so dearly won. I found two full-blown white roses completely hidden as I picked tomatoes in June. But they were weak and the leaves already yellow for lack of light. Here I am faced with a painful small decision: To tear up a wonderful and productive tomato plant that offers up between ten and twenty ripe sweet tomatoes each day or say goodbye to several expensive and treasured roses. Like Scarlett in Gone With the Wind, I' ll think about that tomorrow. The writer planted the tomato plant because   .",

Most schools in England take football seriously-much more seriously than nearly all European schools, where lessons are all very important and games are left for the children themselves. In England it is believed that education is not only a matter filling a boy's mind with facts in the classroom: education also means the training of character; and one of the best ways of training character is by means of games, especially team games; where a boy or girl has to learn to work with others for his or her team, instead of working for oneself alone.

They say that the warmer temperature is causing permafrost to thaw in some areas. The thawing permafrost can cause problems for people, plants, and animals. \"The collapsing  is a problem in the villages in Alaska which are built on permafrost, and some of them may have to move to safer ground, where there is no permafrost,\" Weller said. The Alaskan town of Glennallen saw its old post office collapse. And, according to James Walters, a permafrost expert at the University of Northern Iowa, house-moving companies have been very busy. \"Melting permafrost can also destroy trees and forests,\" Weller said. \"When holes in the ground form, trees fall into them and die. This could turn a forest into a swamp , and animals which need the forest will have to move elsewhere.\" The melting could cause \"severe problems.\" Weller says: \"This could take hundreds of years, but in the end Alaska will look quite different from what it looks like now.\" What does the word \"permafrost\" refers to in this passage?",

        "question": "We all know what it is like to be unable to turn your head because of a cold in the muscles   of your neck, or because an unexpected twist has made your neck ache. The slightest move makes you jump with pain. Nothing could be worse than a pain in the neck. That is why we use the phrase to describe some people who give you the same feeling. We have all met such people. One is the man who always seems to be clapping his hands--often at the wrong time--during a performance in the theater. He keeps you from hearing the actors. Even worse are those who can never arrive before the curtain goes up and the play begins. They come hurrying down to your row of seats. You are comfortably settled down, with your hat and heavy coat in your lap. You must stand up to let them pass. You are proud of yourself-control after they have settled into their seats...Well, what now...God, one of them is up again. He forgot to go to the men's room, and once more you have to stand up, hanging on to your hat and coat to let him pass. Now, that is \" _ \". Another, well--known to us all, is the person sitting behind you in the movies. His mouth is full of popcorn  ; he is chewing loudly, or talking between bites to friends next to him. None of them remain still. Up and down, back and forth, they go--for another bag of popcorn, or something to drink. Then, there is the man sitting next to you at lunch, smoking. He wants you to enjoy it too, and blows smoke across your food into your mouth. We must not forget the man who comes into a bus or subway and sits down next to you, just as close as you will let him. You are reading the newspaper and he gets closer so that he can read the paper with you. He may even turn the paper to the next page before you are ready for it. We also call such a person a \" _ , always getting close to where it does not belong, like neighbors who watch all your visitors. They enjoy learning about your personal business.

        "question": "A purple tomato genetically engineered to contain nutrients more commonly seen in dark berries helped cancer in mice, British researchers said on Sunday. The finding, published in the journal Nature Biotechnology, the idea that plants can be genetically modified(changed) to make people healthier. Cancer-prone mice fed the modified fruit lived significantly longer than animals fed a standard diet with and without regular tomatoes, Cathie Martin and colleagues at the government-funded John Innes Center in Britain reported. \"The effect was much bigger than we had expected.\" said Martin, a plant biologist. The study focused on anthocyanins,a type of antioxidant found in berries such as blackberries and blackcurrants that have been shown to lower risk of cancer, heart diseases and some neurological diseases. While an easy way to improve health, many people don't eat enough of these fruits, the researchers said. Using genes from the snapdragon flower, the researchers discovered they could get the tomatoes to make anthocyanins---- turning the tomato purple in the process. Mice genetically engineered to develop cancer lived an average of 182 days when they were fed the purple tomatoes, compared to 142 days for animals on the standard diet. \"It is greatly encouraging to believe that by changing diet, or specific components in the diet. You can improve health in animals and possibly humans.\" Martin said in a telephone interview. The researchers warned that trials in humans are a long way off and the next step is to investigate( look into) how the antioxidants actually affect the tumors to promote better health. But the findings do support the formal research suggesting that people can significantly improve their health by making simple changes to the daily diet, other researchers said. \"It's exciting to see new techniques that could potentially make healthy foods even better for us.\" said Doctor Lara Bennett, science information office at Cancer Research UK. \" But it is too early to say whether anthocyanins obtained through diet could help to reduce the risk of cancer.\" The text mainly tells us    _   .",

        "question": "FFather was a hardworking man who delivered bread as a living to support his wife and three children. He spent all his evenings after work attending classes,hoping to improve himself so that he could one day find a better. paid job. Except. for Sundays, Father hardly ate a meal together with his family. He worked and studied very hard because he wanted to provide his family with the best that money could buy. Whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else.  The day came when the examination results were announced. To his joy, Father passed, and with distinctions too! Soon after, he was offered a good job as a senior supervisor which paid handsomely. Like a dream come true, Father could now afford to provide his family with life's little luxuries like nice clothing,fine food and vacation abroad. However, the family still did not get to see Father for most of the week. He continued to work very hard, hoping to be promoted to the position of manager. In fact, to make himself a worthily candidate for the promotion, he took another course in an open university. Again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else. Father's hard work paid off and he was promoted. Happily, he decided to hire a maid to relieve his wife from her domestic tasks. He also felt that their three-room flat was no longer big enough. It would be nice for his family to be able to enjoy the facilities and comfort of a condominium.  Having experienced the rewards of his hard work many times before, Father resolved to further his studies and work at being promoted again. The family still did not get to see much of him. In fact, sometimes Father had to work on Sundays entertaining clients.  Over again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else. As expected, Father's hard work paid off again and he bought a beautiful condominium overlooking the coast of Singapore. On the first Sunday evening at their new home, Father declared to his family that he decided not to take any more courses or pursue any more promotions. From then on he was going to devote more time to his family, and it was a promise. Father did not wake up the next day. How would the family feel when \"Father did not wake up the next day\"?",

In the Philippine Islands, rice was used as money for a long time. Elephant tusks, monkey tails, and salt were used as money in parts of Africa. Some animals were used as money too. The first metal coins were made in China. They were round and had a square hole in the center. People _ them together and carried them from place to place.

I don't know her name, nor where she was going ,but I know I will never forget that stranger who generously saved me from a lot of frustration  and prevented me from walking a mile or more to my destination.  That day My husband, Leo, and I were already a half hour late for an important conference . We had taken the wrong fork in the expressway, and found ourselves stuck in traffic that was blocked for four miles due to a serious accident.  When we finally were able to exit, we tried to find parking lots near the hosting hotel. But they were all full. Not expecting this, neither of us had brought change; all we had was a twenty dollar bill. When we did find some space in a lot two blocks away from the conference, we were unable to pay the automatic box for parking. So we needed five dollars.   We asked several people approaching the pay box if they could change a twenty. \"No\", \"No\", \"No\" were their answers. So,  _ , we walked back to our car, got inside, and started to back out. We were going to look for other parking spot on the street that would surely have taken us a longer distance away. Just then, one tapped on the window on the passenger side. It was a short, medium-built woman, who was all bundled up in jacket and scarf, wearing jeans and boots. Surprised, I was reluctant, at first, to roll the window down. What could she possibly want? I lowered the window just enough to hear what the woman had to say. Through the window, she shoved a five dollar bill. \"I don't have change,\" she said, \"but here is an extra five dollar bill. Use it to pay for your parking spot.\" I was floored! Was this woman, whom I'd never seen before, actually giving me this much money? Yes, that was exactly what she was doing!

        "question": "Where Virtual Reality Takes Us No matter how enlightened any one of us may be , we are fundamentally limited to our own points of view--but it is human nature to try to broaden our perspective . For me , that's where V.R. comes in . I have found that the medium has an extraordinary ability to convey the kinds of feelings of presence and place I've always desired to capture through photojournalism . As a young photographer , I was shocked by the wartime images of great photographers like Robert Capa and James Nachtwey . Their vision of the world is far better than my own . Hoping to imitate their effect , I trained myself to follow in their footsteps , covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as a photojournalist for The New York Times and Newsweek . But I found that my photographs were not having the impact that I had hoped . There was something too abstract and flat about them , a quality that allowed anyone viewing them to remain distant from images of suffering . Frustrated by the barriers , I built a camera that could shoot steady , cinematic video in a war zone , and I made a feature-length film in Afghanistan . While the film provided a glimpse into the cruel reality of war , it was only a small window into that world . I wanted to go further , to pull people through that window onto the front lines and let them witness it firsthand . I started the technology company Condition One in order to build a new camera to shoot in 3D , 360-degree video . We want to introduce a new generation of viewers tired of flat images into the emotions of being immersed in a whole new world . The power of virtual reality is its command of presence--its ability to transport the viewer into another world , and have him feel present in it . These experiences are technically difficult to create and require significant computing power , but once presence is achieved and maintained , it is breathtaking . In V.R., we instinctively feel empathy for those whose experiences we are immersed in . The suffering of people in war zones becomes our suffering , just as the killing of animals in the wild becomes a source of our pain as well . Mentioning his own limitations of perspective , Einstein once wrote with sadness , \" Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of sympathy to hug all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty . \" Through V.R., we now have a chance to do just that . We can learn from the passage that James Nachtwey is a photographer   _   .",

We are sure that humans will continue to use more and more technology. Here are some examples of modern technology that will change our ideas and will affect our lives greatly. Global Positioning System (GPS)   It's a system that uses radio signals from satellites to show exact   information.   It tells you where the user is on the earth in all weather conditions.  It's made up of three parts: satellites, control equipments   on land and receivers. Space Technology Russian and American scientists have worked together for the International Space Station, (ISS) for a long time. They hope the ISS will provide a long-lasting lab. Such a lab will bring humans limitless   advantages. It's even hoped that one day space technology will take humans to their new houses in space. Underwater Robot Hercules is a kind of underwater robot with some high technology equipments. It will be used to search for ancient ships which were destroyed into the deep sea during their journey long ago. The world is changing so quickly that it's hard for us to catch up with all the new inventions because they seem to come out every month.

        "question": "I grew up in Jamaica Plain, an urban community located on the outskirts of Boston, Massachusetts. In the 1940's it was a wholesome, specific little community. It was my home and I loved it there; back then I thought I would never leave. My best friend Rose and I used to collectively dream about raising a family of our own someday. We had it all planned out to live next door to one another. Our dream remained alive through grade school, high school, and even beyond. Rose was my maid of honor when I got married in 1953 to the love of my life, Dick. Even then she joked that she was just one perfect guy short of being married, thus bringing us closer to our dream. Meanwhile, Dick aspired to be an officer in the Marines and I fully supported his ambitions. I realized that he might be stationed far away from Jamaica Plain, but I told him I would relocate and adjust. The idea of experiencing new places together seemed somewhat romantic to me. So, in 1955, Dick was stationed in Alaska and we relocated. Rose was sad to see me leave, but wished me the best of luck. Rose and I remained in touch for a few years by regular phone call but after a while we lost track of one another. Back in the 1950's it was a lot more difficult to stay in touch with someone over a long distance, especially if you were relocating every few years. There were no email addresses or transferable phone number and directory lookup services were available at best. I thought of her several times over the years. Once in the mid 1960's ,when I was visiting the Greater Boston area, I tried to determine her whereabouts but my search turned up empty-handed. Jamaica Plain had changed drastically in the 10 years I was gone. A pretty obvious shift in income demographics was affecting my old neighborhood. My family had moved out of the area, as did many of the people I used to know. Rose was nowhere to be found. 52 years passed and we never spoke. I've since raised a family of five, all of whom now have families of their own, and Dick passed away a few years ago. Basically, a lifetime has passed. Now here I am at the doorstep to my 80th birthday and I receive a random phone call on an idle Wednesday afternoon. \"Hello?\" I said. \"Hi Natalie, it's Rose,\" the voice on the other end replied. \"It's been so long. I don't know if you remember me, but we used to be best friends in Jamaica Plain when we were kid\" she said. We haven't seen each other yet, but we have spent countless hours on the phone catching up on 52 years of our lives. The interesting thing is that even after 52 years of separation our personalities and interests are still extremely similar. We both share a passion for several hobbies that we each picked up independently several years after we lost touch with one another. It almost feels like we are picking up right where we left off, which is really strange considering the circumstances. Her husband passed away a few years ago as well, but she mailed me several photographs of her family that were taken over the years. It's so crazy, just looking at the photos and listening to her describe her family reminds me of my own; a reasonably large, healthy family. Part of me feels like we led fairly similar lives. I don't think the numerous similarities between our two lives are a coincidence either. I think it shows that we didn't just call each other best friend we truly were best friend and even now we can be best friends again. Real friends have two things in common: a compatible personality and a strong-willed character. The compatible personality is what initiates the connection between two people and a strong-willed character at both ends is what maintains the connection. If those two ingredients are present in a friendship, the friendship is for real, and can thus sustain the tests of time and prolonged absence without faltering. Which was not the reason for their loss in touch?",

        "question": "Forbes asked a panel of architects and campus designers to nominate their picks for the best-looking campuses in the world. These are their top choices. Kenyon College Gambier, Ohio, US Mike Evans, a principal at Norfolk, Va., design firm Hanbury Evans Wright Vlattas + Company, says to be beautiful a campus must have a \"signature campus space as a carrier of the campus brand.\" At Kenyon College, that space is \"Middle Path,\" a 10-foot-wide footpath that serves as the Gothic hilltop campus' central artery. More than just a trail, it's a village green for the tight-knit campus community. Sergei Lobanov-Rostovsky, who teaches 17th-century poetry at Kenyon, says the college, both isolated and pastoral, is \"a small place to think big thoughts.\" Oxford University Oxford, England Teaching within Oxford's stone walls dates as far back as the 11th century, and the school is considered a paradigm  for all college campuses. With its labyrinth of quads, cloisters, and archways, it evokes elegance and tradition at every turn. \"Its monastic roots and the spectacular quality of its buildings make it an architectural wonderland,\" says David Mayernik, associate professor at Notre Dame's School of Architecture. Princeton University Princeton, N.J., US Princeton's style is pure Collegiate Gothic ; most of it executed in gray stone covered in, yes, ivy. As imposing as these old stone structures are, the campus keeps life on a \"human scale\" by preserving green spaces and walkability.Sinuous footpaths, archways, plazas - all are designed to inspire spontaneous discussion and learning. Scripps College Claremont, Calif., US The total plan of this women's college, founded in the 1920's, has always called for artistic connection between buildings and landscape. Together, architect Gordon Kaufmann, in collaboration with landscape architect Edward Huntsman-Trout, created a distinctively Southern Californian blend of Mission Revival-inspired architecture and landscape, which is lovely, evocative and intact. An expert in deciduous trees, Trout planted rows of liquid amber trees to give the students \"a sense of autumn\" come fall. He also peppered the campus with tulip trees, sycamores, almond and orange trees, as well as rare shrubs. Stanford University Palo Alto, Calif., US New additions like the Science and Engineering Quad manage to gracefully blend modern and technological elements with the timeless, elegant aesthetics of the campus' early California Mission Revival architecture. The campus also scores big points for its dramatic entrance via Palm Drive, its romantic Spanish red-tile roofs and myriad patches of green. Tsinghua University Beijing, China Forbe's panel of architects says natural setting plays a big part in assessing a campus' beauty. In that regard, this campus is blessed: Founded in 1925, Tsinghua sits on the former site of the Qing Dynasty's royal gardens. Many of Beijing's most notable historical sites, like the Summer Palace, are close by. The campus is peppered with artificial ponds where stone benches and floating lotus blossoms inspire reflection.

        "question": "It was a winter morning, just a couple of weeks before Christmas 2005.While most people were warming up their cars, Trevor, my husband, had to get up early to ride his bike four kilometers away from home to work.On arrival, he parked his bike outside the back door as he usually does.After putting in 10 hours of labor, he returned to find his bike gone. The bike, a black Kona 18 speed, was our only transport.Trevor used it to get to work, putting in 60-hour weeks to support his young family.And the bike was also used to get groceries , saving us from having to walk long distances from where we live. I was so sad that someone would steal our bike that I wrote to the newspaper and told them our story.Shortly after that, several people in our area offered to help.One wonderful stranger even bought a bike, then called my husband to pick it up.Once again my husband had a way to get to and from his job.It really is an honor that a complete stranger would go out of their way for someone they have never met before. People say that a smile can be passed from one person to another, but acts of kindness from strangers are even more so.This experience has had a spreading effect in our lives because it strengthened our faith in humanity as a whole.And it has influenced us to be more mindful of ways we, too, can share with others.No matter how big or how small, an act of kindness shows that someone cares.And the results can be everlasting.

        "question": "Imagine a school where there are no academic requirements,no curriculum,and no tests.Children have total contro1 of their education and are free to do what they want all day,every day.Sudbury Valley School in Framingham,Massachusetts has been operating this way since 1968.More than 30 schools worldwide have imitated the Sudbury model,and over 200 schools identify similarly as \"democratic schools.\"These schools are designed based on the belief that children have an innate curiosity to learn and do best when they direct their own learning.     Sudbury Vallev School admits anyone who wants to enroll between the ages of 4 and 18.Many parents send their kids from a young age because they believe that kids do best when they learn what they want to learn.Other students come to Sudbury because they had various issues in traditional school systems including rebellion,learning difficulties,and  emotional problems.     Sudbury is administered through a democratic process where every student and staff member has an equal vote.In fact,students outnumber staff 20 to 1.There's no age  segregation ;four-year-olds can hang out with teenagers.Many staff members are part time and have rich careers as historians,businessmen,psychologists,artists,among others.     Learning is self-directed and occurs informally through having conversations,starting  projects.reading for enjoyment,and playing games.If students are interested in a particular topic,they work with staff and other students to organize courses and find resources.The  requirement for getting a high school diploma is to write an essay about how they are prepared t0 be an adult.95%of students graduate.90%of graduates end up going to college,better than the national average of 66%.     Most graduates say that they benefited from a self-directed education because they were  more motivated than their peers,lacked fear of authority figures,and got a head start in their field of interest.They work hard at doing the things they love to do. Which of the following shows the school is democratically managed?",

        "question": "An old problem is getting new attention in the United States--bullying.Recent cases included the tragic case of a fifteen-year-old girl whose family moved from Ireland.She hanged herself in Massachusetts in January following months of bullying.Her parents criticized her school for failing to protect her.Officials have brought criminal charges against several teenagers. Judy Kaczynski is president of an anti-bullying group called Bully Police USA.Her daughter Tina was the victim of severe bullying starting in middle school in the state of Minnesota.She said, \"Our daughter was a very outgoing child.She was a bubbly personality, very involved in all kinds of things, had lots of friends.And over a period of time her grades fell completely.She started having health issues.She couldn't sleep.She wasn't eating.She had terrible stomach pains.She started clenching her jaw and grinding her teeth at night.She didn't want to go to school.\" Bullying is defined as negative behavior repeated over time against the same person. It can involve physical violence.Or it can be verbal -- for example, insults or threats.Spreading lies about someone or excluding a person from a group is known as social or relational bullying. And now there is cyberbullying, which uses the Internet, e-mail or text messages.It has easy appeal for the bully because it does not involve face-to-face contact and it can be done at any time. The first serious research studies into bullying were done in Norway in the late 1970s.The latest government study in the United States was released last year.It found that about one-third of students age twelve to eighteen were bullied at school. Susan Sweater is a psychologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and co-director of the Bullying Research Network.She says schools should treat bullying as a mental health problem to get bullies and victims the help they need.She says bullying is connected to depression, anxiety and anti-social behavior, and bullies are often victims themselves.

        "question": "Teens' lives hit by economy Some teenagers are crossing their dream colleges off their lists. Others are thinking of skipping their senior trips or reducing prom costs. Many are finding their work hours cut while their expenses rise. So, who exactly is punishing them?Is it their parents, teachers or employers?No, it's the economy . If you are like most teenagers, you probably don't understand what \"recession\", \"negative economic growth\" and \"subprime mortgage crisis  \"actually mean. And you probably don't spend your days watching the ups and downs of the stock market. It's safe to say that most teens don't know much about the economy except for one thing:it's bad. But just how exactly is the economy affecting teens? \"The single largest thing I have noticed is the recession's ability to affect my college choice, \"said Heather Richars from Downey High School in California, US. \"With the economic situation the way it is, I have thought less about going to a private or out-of-state university, and more about public schools in California, mainly because of the price of tuition, \"said Richars. \"I had been a fan of attending a private school up until this year.\" The economy cuts into other areas of teenagers' lives, too. Joey Camarda, a student at Modesto High School in California, who works at an ice cream store,  said,\" Probably due to the economy, I have been getting less hours at my job, and because of that, I am not getting enough money to help pay for college.\" Tara Mooney, a senior at Beyer High School, has also begun to notice that money is tight. \"Things are getting expensive,\" she said. \"When it comes to applying for colleges and wanting to go on senior trips, I have to pick and choose instead of doing it all.\" How has Joey Camarda found the recession affects him?",

        "question": "Last week I visited one of my old neighborhoods in Washington D.C.I had not been there for twenty years and as I walked along the street, my mind was flooded by memories of the past. I saw the old apartment building where I had lived and the playground where I had played. As I viewed these once familiar surroundings, images of myself as a child there came to mind. However, what I saw and what I remembered were not the same. I sadly realized that the best memories are those left untouched.     My old apartment building, as I remember, was bright and alive. It was more than just a place to live. It was a movie house, a space station, or whatever my young mind could imagine. I would steal away with my friends and play in the basement. This was always exciting because it was so cool and dark, and there were so many things there to hide among. There was a small river in the back of the building. We would go there to lie in the shade of trees and enjoy ourselves.   However, what I saw was completely different. The apartment building was now in disrepair. What was once more than a place to live looked hardly worth living in. The windows were all broken. The once clean walls were covered with dirty marks. The river was hardly recognizable. The water was polluted and the trees and flowers were all dead. The once sweet-smelling river now smelled terrible. It was really heartbreaking to see all this. I do not regret having seen my old neighborhood. However, I do not think my innocent childhood memories can ever be the same. I suppose it is true when they say, \"You can never go home again.\" On his visit to his hometown, the writer found the old apartment building   _  .",

        "question": "Is getting a black belt  on your life's to-do list? Then this elderly woman in San Francisco just might be your hero. Just two years before her 100th birthday, Sensei Keiko Fukuda has become the first woman to achieve a tenth-degree black belt --- the highest rank in Judo  . Fukuda is now one of only four living people who have earned the tenth-degree black belt. Throughout history, only 16 people have ever achieved this honor. Fukuda began practicing Judo in 1935 and is the only surviving student of its founder, Kano Jiguro. At her teacher's requirement, she learned English to help spread Judo internationally. During a time when getting married, building a family and becoming a housewife were the norms ,Fukuda broke from tradition, continuing Judo instead of getting married. \"All I did was Judo ... This was my marriage,\" Fukuda replied tearfully to the San Francisco Chronicle. \"This is when my destiny   was set. I just imagined how long the road would be.\" She described the Jiguro's school as \"old-fashioned and sexist  about belts and ranks\". In fact, an edict  that prevented women from achieving any higher than a fifth-degree black belt kept Fukuda at that level for 30 years. She finally got the sixth degree in 1972 when a women's division was created. Fukuda thinks Judo and her life to be \"gentle, kind and beautiful, yet firm and strong, both mentally and physically\". Fukuda says this kind of beauty is not external . She explained. \"I believe this inner beauty is true beauty... All my life this has been my dream.\" Her dream was turned into reality, and the 98-year-old Sensei Keiko Fukuda continues to teach Judo three times a week at a women's Judo training center.

        "question": "A fellow speaker from California named Geri flew to Japan, in her favorite jeans and a casual jacket, to give her first speech. Fourteen hours later, four perfectly dressed Japanese gentlemen greeted her at Narita Airport. Smiling and bowing low, they handed her their business cards. With her bag in one hand, Geri took their cards with the other. She thanked them, glanced briefly at the cards, and put them into her jeans pocket quickly. When the five of them arrived at the hotel, they invited Geri to tea in the lobby  . While sipping tea, the gentlemen presented her with a small gift which she eagerly opened. She was thrilled with the gift and shouted excitedly, \"Oh, it's beautiful!\" At this point, the four Japanese gentlemen stood up and, bowing only very slightly, said \"Sayonara\" and left immediately. Poor Geri was left astonished. What did she do wrong? Everything! Her jeans were the first gaffe. Even if you're coming off a bicycle in Japan, you do not meet c1ients   casually dressed. The second mistake was Geri's handling of their business cards rudely. In Japan, the business card is one of the most important communicative tools. It is always presented and accepted respectfully with both hands. However, Geri put their cards away much too quickly. In Japan, people use business cards as a conversation starter. You chat about each other's cards and work and do not put theirs away until they gently and respectfully place yours in safekeeping. Putting it carelessly into her jeans pocket was the ultimate disrespect. Then, the fourth horror of horrors was that Geri should not have opened the gift in front of her clients. In a land where saving face is critical, it would be embarrassing to discover the gift they gave was not as nice as the one they received. What is worse, Geri hadn't even given them a gift! Why did the four Japanese gentlemen leave Geri suddenly?",

        "question": "After 21 years of marriage, my wife wanted me to take another woman out to dinner and a movie. The other woman my wife wanted me to visit was my mother, who has been a widow  for 19 years, but the demands of my work and my three children had made it impossible to visit her often. That Friday after work, when I arrived at her house, my mother waited in the door with her coat on. She had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding anniversary.  We went to a restaurant that, although not elegant, was very nice and comfortable. My mother took my arm as if she were the First Lady. During the dinner, we had an agreeable conversation, nothing extraordinary but catching up on recent events of each other's life. We talked so much that we missed the movie. As we arrived at her house later, she said, \"I'll go out with you again, but only if you let me invite you.\" I agreed. A few days later, my mother died of a massive heart attack. It happened so suddenly that I didn't have a chance to do anything for her. Some time later, I received an envelope with a copy of a restaurant receipt from the same place Mother and I had dined. An attached note said \"I paid this bill in advance. I wasn't sure that I could be there; but, nevertheless, I paid for two plates--one for you and the other for your wife. You w ill never know what that night meant for me. I love you, son.\" At that moment, I understood the importance of saying in time 'I love YOU' and to give our loved ones the time that they deserve. Nothing in life is more important than your family. Give them the time they deserve because these things cannot be put off till some \"other\" time.

        "question": "Most city parks are places where you can escape from big, ugly structures of metal and stone. The Manhattan High Line is different. Raised 25 feet above the ground, this large metal structure once supported a rail line. The line opened in 1934 to bring trains directly into factories. It was hardly used after the 1960s, and much of it was torn down. However, one part remained in a region of Manhattan called Chelsea. Chelsea was becoming high-class as restaurants, art galleries and apartments were built, but the ugly railway structure remained as _ . Everyone knew that at some time, it would have to be removed. But the High Line was not destroyed. In fact, now the old rail line serves as one of the most peaceful places in the city. It holds an elevated  park, with beautiful gardens and great views of the city. The idea to turn the rail line into a park came from Joshua David and Robert Hammond. In 1999, they attended a meeting to decide how to deal with the High Line. David and Hammond were the only people at the meeting interested in saving the historical structure. Later on, when they asked railway officials to take them up to look at the High Line, they saw a mile and a half of wild flowers growing in the middle of the city, and they realized that the High Line had potential  to become a park. There was growing interest in improving city centers, and so the project quickly developed and money for construction was easily collected. The first section of the High Line opened in 2009 and immediately became popular with tourists and locals alike. Each part of the park has a different atmosphere. Some areas are like balconies  with wonderful city views. Where the rail line goes between buildings, trees are thickly planted. Other sections have wide lawns  and walkways planted with wild flowers. Only the final section remains the way it has been for the last fifty years. What can we learn about the High Line from the text?",

        "question": "Over the last 70 years, researchers have been studying happy and unhappy people and finally found out ten factors that make a difference. Our feelings of well-being at any moment are determined to a certain degree by genes. However, of all the factors, wealth and age are the top two. Money can buy a degree of happiness. But once you can afford to feed, clothe and house yourself , each extra dollar makes less and less difference. Researchers find that, on average, wealthier people are happier. But the link between money and happiness is complex. In the past half-century, average income has sharply increased in developed countries, yet happiness levels have remained almost the same. Once your basic needs are met, money only seems to increase happiness if you have more than your friends, neighbors and colleagues. \"Dollars buy status, and status makes people feel better,\" conclude some experts, which helps explain why people who can seek status in other ways---scientists or actors, for example--may happily accept relatively poorly-paid jobs. In a research, Professor Alex Michalos found that the people whose desires--not just for money, but for friends, family, job, health--rose furthest beyond what they already had, tended to be less happy than those who felt a smaller gap. Indeed, the size of the gap predicted happiness about five times better than income alone. \"The gap measures just blow away the only measures of income.\" Says Michalos. Another factor that has to do with happiness is age. Old age may not be so bad. \"Given all the problems of aging, how could the elderly be more satisfied?\" asks Professor Laura Carstensen. In one survey, Carstensen interviewed 184 people between the ages of 18 and 94, and asked them to fill out an emotions questionnaire. She found that old people reported positive emotions just as often as young people, but negative emotions much less often. Why are old people happier? Some scientists suggest older people may expect life to be harder and learn to live with it, or they're more realistic about their goals, only setting ones that they know they can achieve. But Carstensen thinks that with time running out, older people have learned to focus on things that make them happy and let go of those that don't. \"People realize not only what they have, but also that what they have cannot last forever,\" she says. \"A goodbye kiss to a husband or wife at the age of 85, for example, may bring far more complex emotional responses than a similar kiss to a boy or girl friend at the age of 20. Aged people are more likely to feel happy because they are more  _  .",

Then they asked them to name their favorite kind of music. \"We found that the musical style people like are closely linked to their personalities,\" Gosling says.

If you like rap/hip-hop, you are energetic and have a way with words. _ , whether it's new moves on the dance floor or your hip style. CLASSLCAL In the 18thcentury, classical musicians were like rock stars. Beethoven and Mozart, for example, played in packed concert halls. If you like classical, you are open to new ideas and like debating with friends. Creative and imaginative, you can easily spend many hours scrapbooking, writing or painting. COUNTRY Country music came from the folk songs of English, Scottish, and Irish settlers of the southeastern United States. If you like country, you express your opinions well, which makes you the ideal class president or team captain. Traditional and loyal, you enjoy spending time with your family. POP Pop music is designed to appeal to   almost everyone, and it does. Each year, the industry brings in about 30 billion dollars! If you like pop, you are attractive to your friends. You can make big things happen, like planning for a huge party or inspiring your team to victory. ROCK In the 1950s, rock music created a brand-new culture. Teenagers, for the first time, had an identity separate from adults and children. If you like rock, you are a risk-taker who never accepts no for an answer. You rise to any challenge, like doing very well in a big exam or landing the lead in the school play. If these personality profiles don't match you, that's OK. These are just for fun.

        "question": "Music is often thought of as \"easy\" or \"play time\", but it's not that at all. Music plays a very important part in our education. Students who learn music learn a lot of music history at school. This includes \"modes  \",which were used in churches during the development of music. They are still used today. Students learn about the historical events that were taking place when the music they play was written. They learn what the music was used for. So much of our culture is in music and has been for centuries.  Music also helps with science. Students use science to help them discover what sounds good together and what doesn't. Students also need science to understand something called the \"overtone series\", which is about how music is produced by vibration   and why. Students learn a lot about languages. Many songs are written in other languages, including ancient ones. Students must learn to translate these works to understand what they are singing about. Some songs are famous poems or short works set to music. Students learn a huge amount of coordination   through music, so parts of the body can work better together. Students must use fine motor skills in order to play an instrument. Singers and players must learn breath control and be in good shape to play. Students learn about art. Some famous pieces were written about important works of art, and students learn about the artists and styles as they're playing the music.  Music education also brings higher thinking to our children. It allows them to think about complex patterns (How can I make my part sound better?How do this music and these different parts fit together?). Students have to know absolutely what every other musician does at all times. In that way, it develops teamwork. As one can see, music is very important to education besides bringing us fun.

He has repeated that phrase more than once, and my mind continually plays it over like a voice recording. I met him about three years ago. After knowing me for six months, he told me about his struggles with depression. Sadness was not the only emotion that came over me; I was shocked. He seemed so outgoing and happy all the time. I soon learned that he was physically and emotionally abused as a young child, causing him to have suicidal thoughts. He refuses to talk to others about his depression because he now distrusts adults, especially those in his family. Nevertheless, he feels as if I understand him and that I know the right words to speak. Therefore, when it comes to helping him, _ . It does not matter where I am or what I am doing, for he always comes first. Many students at his school laugh at him when they notice scars on his arms from cutting. As he sees it, other kids have every right to make fun of him. But no one holds such a right, so I encourage him to ignore the heartless kids who treat him badly. When he feels the weight of judging eyes or hateful voices, I always remind him that I care about him unconditionally. Just hearing me say I will always be his best friend seems to give him the security he needs to keep on going. My best friend once told me that if he had not had me, he would not be alive. He said that my encouraging words convinced him not to take his life. Our friendship has taught me that a single kind word can influence someone's life. With the fragility of life as it is, I believe in the necessity of encouragement. From the passage we learn that the author's friend   _  .",

I know already that the Mall of America had been imagined by its designers, not only as a marketplace , but as a national tourist attraction.Eleven thousand articles, the small book informed me, had been written about the mall.Four hundred trees had been planted in its gardens, $ 625 million had been spent building it, and 350 stores were already in business.Three thousand bus tours were expected each year along with a half - million Canadian visitors and 200,000 Japanese tourists. Sales was at $ 650 million for 2008 and at $ 1 billion for 2009.Pop singers and film stars such as Janet Jackson and Arnold Schwarzenegger visited the mall.It was five times larger than Red Square and it included 2.3 miles of hallways and used almost twice as Knott' s Camp Snoopy.

        "question": "On Monday, Sept.25, hundreds of people gathered outside the Library of Congress, in Washington D.C., to celebrate public libraries. For more than 100 years, libraries have played an important role in keeping America informed and educated. But how are these book-filled buildings changing with the times? You may be surprised to find out. Benjamin Franklin famously founded America's first lending library in 1731 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. And the public library system developed greatly in the late 1800's. Businessman Andrew Carnegie donated millions of dollars to help build free public libraries across the country. Between 1886 and 1919, Carnegie's donations helped build 1,679 new libraries! Carnegie believed in the opportunities that libraries could offer Americans young and old. He knew that the more libraries there were, the more people would have access to books, lectures, news and more. \"There are now more public libraries in the United States than McDonald's restaurants,\" said Clara Hayden, of Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library.  Chances are that there is a public library in or near your community . After all, the United States is home to 9,225 public libraries. Today, libraries continue to develop and grow. Seven out of ten libraries offer free Internet access. This opens any doors for community members who cannot go online at home, including the opportunity to apply for jobs online. Libraries are also teaching kids about the fun of reading. One new program called Read! Play! ----- combines reading with playtime. As kids listen to a book being read aloud, they use Legos to build images from the story. \"Today's libraries are always looking for creative programming to bring people into the library,\" Lego's Michael McNally said. Benjamin Franklin once said, \"The doors of wisdom are never shut.\" As long as the doors of public libraries are open, his statement is most certainly true! The purpose of the program Read!

        "question": "Should students do the grading? The Supreme Court says the practice doesn't violate  a student's right to privacy, but is it right for students to grade one another? Walter Potenza, California The Supreme Court was absolutely correct to say it's OK for students to grade one another's homework, quizzes, and tests: in fact, it's a great idea. By grading one another's papers and seeing the problems their classmates have, students double their exposure  to the troubles that they may meet on future exams and tests. Grading one another's papers may be one of the best ways for students to _ within themselves the ways to master the most difficult parts of what they are learning. Teachers are underappreciated and underpaid for the number of hours they have to work to be able to teach really well. Grading all their students' papers can take hours. Some of that time and energy can be saved by spending a few minutes in class, while providing an extremely valuable learning experience. I understand that some individuals are sensitive to their classmates seeing their work or grades. Any good teacher would be considerate of students who don't want their classmates to grade their assignments. Winston Smith, North Carolina A girl moves back as her classmate announces her failing test grade and hands her the paper. The quiet classroom heats up. With the increase in student grading over the past few years, scenes like this have become a bitter reality in schools across the nation. Teachers and schools should not advocate student grading and public announcement of grades because it provides a violation of privacy for students and causes unfair judgments and treatment by their classmates. Since 1974, a law known as the Buckley Amendment has forbidden the release of education records in order to protect the privacy of students and their families. I strongly disagree with the Court's ruling that this law does not include student grading. I can think of no greater violation of privacy than the exposure of one's personal information to a group of peers . This can be very embarrassing. Releasing this sort of personal information should be avoided, especially by institutions that seek to provide a supportive environment during essential years of human development. Walter Potenza suggests that   _  .",

        "question": "I was born in Brooklyn. My father was a small-business man and we never had much money. He supported the family, moved us to Merrick on Long Island, when I was 11. He just recently died at age 96. He was still driving and playing golf right to the end. He was the only guy I knew who at age 90 could shoot under his age. I guess that taught me something about perseverance.  I went to the University of Michigan as an engineering student in 1960. I was standing outside the student union building when Senator John F. Kennedy made a campaign speech that essentially announced his plan for the Peace Corps. He talked about how students could provide service for the country. It was an important moment for me.  After I graduated, I worked as a computer programmer for I.B.M. for two years. By then, the Vietnam War was in full swing and the draft  had accelerated. I didn't agree with the war and was interested in finding alternatives. I.B.M. applied for a delay for me twice but the application failed.  I went to work at M.I.T.'s Instrumentation Labs on a project designed to create a rescue vehicle for lost submarines . I thought this job would keep me out of the draft, but M.I.T. hadn't put in the proper paperwork and I got called in for my physical. The day before my physical, I broke my ankle playing tennis and, of course, my draft board didn't believe a word of it. I had to provide X-rays. I had tears in my eyes from the pain, but a smile on my face.  I started John Snow Inc. in 1978 (Dr. Snow is considered the father of modern epidemiology because he traced the source of a cholera epidemic in the 1850s). We had a very clear vision of what we would be. It would not be about making the most money but having the most impact.  My goal was to attract talented people who had that passion to focus on primary care, women's health, child health, and to do great work. I also run a nonprofit called World Education, which focuses on literacy. What motivates me is going to the field, either in the United States or overseas, and seeing the people whose lives we affect.  I didn't grow up rich but had the advantage of growing up in the United States and getting a good education. I couldn't have started J.S.I. in many other places. And I believe there is a duty to try and assist people who are struggling against tough situations. Which of the following best describes the author of the passage?",

But now after a childhood spent crafting those notes, the music of gratitude flows naturally from me. I hire Brant to build an arbor   around my front door. I drew it exactly as I wanted, and he realized my vision perfectly. Surprised at how the arbor's beauty uplifted me every time I stepped into my house, I called Brant a few weeks after the arbor went up. He answered the phone defensively. \"What can I do for you?\" he asked, his voice cold and distant. \"You can say, 'You're welcome,' \" I responded. \"I don't understand,\" Brant shot back. \"I am calling to say 'Thank you.' '' Silence. \"What do you mean?\" he asked. \"I love my arbor, and I wanted you to know how much I appreciate your work.\" More silence. \"I've been doing this work for 20 years, and no one has ever called to thank me for it,\" said Brant. \"People only call me when they have problems.\" He was doubtful. I also had a similar experience with L.J. He answered my questions, didn't push, and gave me space to think and decide. I wrote to let him know that he completely exceeded   my expectations of what a beat-them-down car sales experience would be like, and that I was happy with my car choice. L.J. called me a few days later. He said that this was the first thank-you note in the history of the dealership. Are we really living in an age when feedback   only closes with complaint?

        "question": "Most Americans don't like to get advice from their family. When they need advice, they don't usually ask people they know. They often write letters to newspapers and magazines. And these newspapers and magazines can give advice on many different subjects such as family problems, language learning and how to buy a house and so on. Most newspapers publish   letters from readers with problems. And they would also publish the answers to the letters. There are many writers giving advice to newspapers. Some of these writers are doctors, and some are teachers or lawyers . One of the best writers is a woman. Although she doesn't have special learning for this kind of work, experience helps her a lot to give advice. She is named Angel. She started writing advice for newspapers at the age of ten.

        "question": "One night, I was sitting in my room half listening as my 15-year-old brother Tommy fought with my 12-year-old brother Kevin. I didn't pay attention when Kevin rushed up the stairs with the hurt on his face. About 20mintes later, as I was walking up-stairs I heard Kevin crying inside the bathroom. I knocked on the door and asked, \"Hey, Kevin, do you want to talk?\" No answer. I tried again, \"Why don't you come out of there?\" Again, on answer. I tried again, \"Why don't you come out of there?\" Again, on answer. So, looking around, I grabbed a stack of  cards and a pencil and wrote, \"if you don't want to talk, we can write notes to each other..\" An hour later, I was still sitting on the floor outside the bathroom with two stacks of cards in front of me. One was blank and one was cards from Kevin on which he had translated all his _ feeling into words for me. As I read one of Kevin's notes, tears came to my eyes. It said, \"No-body in this family cares about me. I'm not the youngest, and I'm not the oldest. Tommy thinks I'm silly and Dad wishes he had the other Kevin as a kid because he's better at basketball. And you're never around to even notice me.\" Tears came to my eyes as I wrote back to him. \"You know Kevin, I really do love you and I'm sorry I don't always show it . I am here for you and you are loved in this family.\" There was no answer for a while, but then I heard a tearing sound coming from inside the bathroom. Kevin, who had run out of words wrote on a torn paper cup. \"Thanks.\" I wrote back, \"For what?\" It returned to me with \"Loving me.\" On it. Since then, I try my best to never only half-notice my family members any more. Kevin and I have a closer relationship now. And sometimes when one of us notices that the other is upset, we'll smile and say \"Write it on a paper cup.\" ,. What could the reason that Kevin's Dad doesn't like him?",

        "question": "Today, as I was relaxing at the beach, I couldn't help but eavesdrop(,) on a conversation four high school kids were having on the beach blanket next to me. Their conversation was about making a positive difference in the world. And it went something like this... \"It's impossible to make a difference unless you're a huge company or someone with lots of money and power,\" one of them said. \"Yeah man,\" another replied. \"My mom keeps telling me to move mountains - to speak up and stand up for what I believe. But what I say and do doesn't even get noticed. I just keep answering to 'the man' and then I get slapped back  in place by him when I step out of line.\" \"Repression...\" another snickered. I smiled because I knew exactly how they felt. When I was their age, I was certain I was being repressed and couldn't possibly make a difference in this world. And I actually almost got fired from school once because I openly expressed how repressed  I felt in the middle of the principals' office. I Have A Dream. Suddenly, one of the kids noticed me eavesdropping and smiling. He sat up, looked at me and said, \"What? Do you disagree?\" Then as he waited for a response, the other three kids turned around too. Rather than arguing with them, I took an old receipt out of my wallet , tore it into four pieces, and wrote a different word on each piece. Then I crumbled the pieces into little paper balls and handed a different piece to each one of them. \"Look at the word on the paper I just gave you and don't show it to anyone else.\" The kids looked at the single word I had handed each of them and appeared confused. \"You have two choices,\" I told them. \"If your word inspired you to make a difference in this world, then hold onto it. If not, give it back to me so I can recycle the paper.\" They all returned their words. I walked over quickly , sat down on the sand next to their beach blanket and laid out the four words that the students had returned to me so that the words combined to form the simple sentence,        \"I have a dream.\" \"Dude, that's Martin Luther King Jr.,\" one of the kids said. \"How did you know that?\" I asked. \"Everyone knows Martin Luther King Jr.\" the kid snarled. \"He has his own national holiday, and we all had to memorize his speech in school a few years ago.\" \"Why do you think your teachers had you memorize his speech?\" I asked. \"I don't really care!\" the kid replied. His three friends shook their heads in agreement. \"What does this have to do with us and our situation?\" \"Your teachers asked you to memorize those words, just like thousands of teachers around the world have asked students to memorize those words, because they have inspired millions of repressed people to dream of a better world and take action to make their dreams come true. Do you see where I'm going with this?\" \"Man, I know exactly what you're trying to do and it's not going to work, alright?\" the fourth kid said, who hadn't spoken a word until now. \"We're not going to get all inspired and emotional about something some dude said thirty years ago. Our world is different now. And it's more screwed up than any us can even begin to imagine, and there's little you or I can do about it. We're too small, we're nobody.\" Together I smiled again because I once believed and used to say similar things. Then after holding the smile for a few seconds I said, \"On their own, 'I' or 'have' or 'a' or 'dream' are just words. Not very compelling or inspiring. But when you put them together in a certain order, they create a phrase that has been powerful enough to move millions of people to take action - action that changed laws, perceptions, and lives. You don't need to be inspired or emotional to agree with this, do you?\" The four kids shrugged and struggled to appear totally indifferent, but I could tell they were listening intently. \"And what's true for words is also true for people,\" I continued. \"One person without help from anyone else can't do much to make a big difference in this crazy world - or to overcome all of the various forms of repression that exist today. But when people get together and unite to form something more powerful and meaningful then themselves, the possibilities are endless. Which of the following is not true?",

        "question": "Londoners are great readers. They buy vast numbers of newspapers and magazines and of books --- especially paperbacks, which are still comparatively cheap in spite of ever-increasing rises in the costs of printing.

Perhaps the best known of these is Charring Cross Road in the very heart of London. Here bookshops of all sorts and sizes are to be found, from the celebrated one which boasts of being \"the biggest bookshop in the world\" to the tiny, dusty little places which seem to have been left over from Dickens' time. Some of these shops stock, or will obtain, any kind of book, but many of them specialize in second-hand books, in art books, in foreign books, in books on philosophy, politics or any other of the countless subjects about which books may be written. One shop in this area specializes only in books about ballet! Although it may be the most convenient place for Londoners to buy books, Charring Cross Road is not the cheapest. For the really cheap second-hand books, the collector must _ , to Farringdon Road, for example, in the East Central district of London. Here there is nothing so impressive as bookshops. The booksellers come along each morning and pour out their sacks of books onto small hand carts. And the collectors, some professionals and some amateurs, have been waiting for them.

One study showed that forty percent of those killed in car accidents could have been saved if they have been wearing seat belts. Unfortunately seat belts are worn only by a small number of drivers and passengers _ about fifteen percent in cities and only nine percent in small towns. And safety belt can not protect people who do not wear them. In order to find out what kinds of people do wear seat belts, a study was made in several cities in of the United States. The following facts were learned about those who use their safety belts. 1. They do not smoke while driving. 2. They had more education than less educated people 3. They know some one who was hurt(but not killed) in an accident Advertisements based on these facts have been printed in newspapers and magazines in order to teach people the importance of using seat belt.

        "question": "A speech is a wonderful opportunity to inform, persuade or entertain. The best speeches often take on a combination of all three of these components . However, before you can go about the writing of a great speech, it is important to set goals. Goals keep you,your speech and your audience focused. What a goal is In the context of a speech, a goal is the purpose of the speech, and what it hopes to accomplish. For example, the goal of a eulogy  might be to celebrate the life of a loved one. The goal of a speech at a political gathering would be to inform the crowd about the political position of a candidate and persuade them to vote and campaign for the candidatein question . Why a goal is important Without a goal, a speech is without direction. The goal informs the structure and content of the speech. For example, if a speech's goal is to convince people that smoking is bad for them, the speech will be structured with persuasive arguments to back up the goal. A speech with a goal of informing the audience will keep the information fair and factual. A goal is incredibly important to the speech's ability to connect with an audience. If the speaker is unaware of the goal of the speech, the audience will likely be unaware as well. This severely reduces the effectiveness of the message. Aside from informing the audience of the content and structure, a speech's goal drives the speaker to greater heights. If a speaker is asked to speak on a specific subject, but never establishes the goal, they won't know where to start in the research, organizing and writing of the speech.  _  If you have been charged with  delivering a speech, establishing a goal can seem difficult at first. There are several things to take into consideration. First, think about who you will be speaking to. The demographic  of your audience will likely determine whether you will be able to persuade them, or whether they will be able to sit through(......). Second, think about the topic itself. If the topic is something controversial , it may worth your while to consider an informative approach to present both sides of the issue. Finally, consider your resources. A speech with an informative or persuasive goal usually requires a great deal of research, and sometimes takes more time to write. All the following indicate the importance of a speech goal EXCEPT that   _  .",

        "question": "GU Zhaodi, 60, had taken water for granted for years. In fact, no one in the beautiful lake city of Wuxi, Jiangsu Province had bothered to spare a thought on water. But all that changed dramatically overnight last month when taps in the city ran dry. Due to a blue-green algae   outbreak in Taihu Lake, China's third largest freshwater lake and the source of drinking water for 4 million Wuxi residents ,water from the city's taps became dark and smelly. \"I can't believe there is no water for drinking, let alone cooking and washing,\"said Gu. The lake was blanketed with the algae, giving off a strong smell of rotting meat. A stone thrown into it took a long time to sink. Experts said that algae usually boom because of hot water and rich chemicals like phosphor in the water. \"High temperature and a lack of rain in the past few months helped the growth of algae,\"said Zhang Lijun, an official from the State Environment Protection Administration. \"However, pollution from human activity should be most blamed for the disaster.\" Taihu Lake is surrounded by many small factories, which _ in the 1980s.Inthe 1990s,many foreign-funded  companies joined in. The industries prospered ,Wuxi has grown into one of the wealthiest cities in East China. But that came at the price of pollution. The lake was treated like a waste dump ,with factories emptying industrial waste and untreated sewage into it. Although, after the government's effort, life in the city has gone back to normal, the one-week crisis rang a bell for the government and local people.\"It's time to rebuild the beauty of nature, or our lives will be at risk,\"said Gu. \"A safe environment comes first.

In China, for example, tea is always served when people get together. The Chinese drink it at any time of the day at homes or in teahouses. They prefer their tea plain, with nothing else in it. Tea is also important in Japan. The Japanese have a special way of serving tea called a tea ceremony . It is very old and full of meaning. Everything must be done in a special way in the ceremony. There is even a special room for it in Japanese homes. Another tea-drinking country is England. In England, the late afternoon is \"teatime\". Almost everyone has a cup of tea then. The English usually make tea in a teapot and drink it with milk and sugar. They also eat cakes, cookies and little sandwiches at teatime. In the United States people drink tea mostly for breakfast or after meals. Americans usually use tea bags to make their tea. Tea bags are faster and easier than making tea in teapots.

        "question": "Getting in touch with nature can help keep people fit, reducing the burden of sickness on the health service, conservation   experts say.       Natural England is starting a campaign to get people to spend more time outside among the country's wildlife and natural environment. The aim of the campaign is to get people to have more contact with nature by promoting green spaces and encouraging health professionals to incorporate (......) the thought into the advice and care plans that they give to patients.       Being close to nature can cut stress and increase physical activity. Dr. William Bird from Natural England said: \"Increasing evidence suggests that both physical and mental health are improved through contact with nature. Yet people are having less contact with nature than at any time in the past. This has to change. Children with attention disorders have been shown to improve when they have contact with nature. People recovering from operations have been shown to need fewer painkillers   if they look out at green fields.\" He also said people were more likely to keep up with their regular exercise in natural settings, rather than in a gym or leisure centre.       Natural England is working with the BBC and more than 300 partners to promote its campaign, which will be the first of four campaigns to get people more involved in nature.       Liz Cleaver, from the BBC, said: \"These campaigns now provide the public with the opportunity to get outside and to get actively involved in nature close to where they live. That's great for wildlife --but it's also fantastic for everyone's health and well-being.\"      The campaign has also received support from the government. Dr. Fiona Adshead, England's deputy chief medical officer, said: \"I welcome Natural England's commitment to encourage and enable people to make use of the country's outdoor space for physical activity.\" What is the best title for the text?",

Follow Your Heart by Australian writer Andrew Matthews tells us that making our dreams real is life's biggest _  You may think you're not very good at some school subjects, or that it is impossible for you to become a writer. These kinds of thoughts stop you from getting your dream, the book says. In fact, everyone can make his dream come true. The first thing you must do is to remember what your dream is. Don't let it leave your heart. Keep telling yourself what you want. Do this step by step and your dream will come true faster because a big dream is, in fact, many small dreams. You must also never give up your dream. There will be difficulties on the road to your dreams. But the biggest difficulty comes from yourself. You need to decide what is the most important.

The boy thought for a moment and said, \"Please keep the shirt and I will come back with more money. \" It was clear that he had already used all the money he had and he was $ 8.00 short. The lady in front of me said, \"Well, I could pay half of that. \"I told the boy that I could pay the other half. We dug into our handbags. However, both of us only had ten-dollar bills  and we needed the cashier to get the change for us. Other shoppers began digging into their pockets to find some change. It was amazing and touching as all these strangers seemed to react  with the same mind. All wanted to be of help. Within minutes the cashier said, \"I have too much money.\" The cashier didn't need our ten-dollar bills. Then the lady in front of me, who had been the first to offer help, said, \"Wait! I didn't even get a chance to give anything!\" I smiled at her and said, \"You did your share, because it was your idea and you started all this. \" The little boy smiled and thanked us. We wished him the best and he left. I was left with a good feeling. I had seen the love and goodness of others all around me. The woman in front of me smiled and said, \"It sure feels good to give, doesn't it?\" I smiled back and said, \"Yes !\" Why did the writer and the woman both feel glad?",

        "question": "University -- the best days of my life! I made lots of friends in my student dorm, went to great parties, joined the debating society...and, well, I did some work too -- but I must admit my lecturers were very patient with my tardiness . It's easy to look back at our university days through rose-tinted spectacles but the truth is that when we first arrived on campus, most of us were out of our comfort zone. In fact, a survey of students at Imperial College London has revealed that 3 out of 4 students experience high levels of stress, or a mental health condition, during their time at college. The survey, completed by over a thousand students, also found that 70% of those that experience stress do so at least once a week, and 9% of students feel stressed constantly. Kirsty, a student at Exeter University, didn't enjoy her first days in college. She says: \"When I first got to university I don't think I'd realized that I'd forgotten how to make friends. I'd been with the same school friends for seven years, and so I was trying to balance social success with academic success while learning how to look after myself at quite a young age.\" Dr Ruth Caleb of the counseling service at Brunel University in London has some tips that should make life easier for students before they set off for university. She says: \"Certain things that I think it would be very helpful for students to have put in place are an ability to do the practical things of life - to do the washing, to do the cleaning and so on -- being able to cook. Budgeting is extremely important in university life.\" And Caleb adds: \"You should learn how to spend time on your own comfortably.\" I graduated and learnt how to take care of myself the hard way. I hope that new students these days remember to acquire some life skills before they make the big jump. Which of the following tips are helpful or important EXCEPT   _   according to Dr. Ruth Caleb?",

        "question": "What is more important to a high school student than being popular? Anyone who has ever gone to high school or at least seen a John Hughes' movie knows the answer to that question. When Theresa Sommers first discovered MySpace three years ago, the teen from Minneapolis, St. Paul thought she had found the real high school popularity contest. She could spend hours a day creating an online picture, finding cool pictures and music to make her page look more beautiful, and looking for interesting-looking people to be her online friends. And along the way, she could compete with her friends to see who had the most friends or most-visited page.    The more she used the site, however, the less interested she became in only being popular; she started using her time for more heartfelt conversations with friends and went more deeply into her personal interests. As a beginner in taking pictures, she put her best pictures on the site and looked for advice from people who are good at taking pictures.     At the same time,she began to get in touch with the students of the colleges she wanted to go to. She opened up a new account on Facebook. And she even began to put some of her own creative writing on the website and would ask for advice on homework from her friends. She asked them,\" How long did you spend on your homework?\" or \"How would you write it?\" Often she would put her homework online. Which of the following is Theresa most interested in?",

        "question": "Some children cannot wait to grow up. Because once you become an adult, you are free to make your own decisions. More importantly, you can do all those things that you cannot do now because you are too young. So, the question is, 'At what age do you really become an adult?' Well, people become adults at different ages in different places. In Australia, the 18th birthday is a very important event for young Australians because it means they can do almost anything they want. They can vote, learn to drive a car, get married, join the army and even buy their own houses. However, even if they can do all these things, most Australians have to wait until their 21st birthday to really celebrate becoming an adult. This is the traditional adult age not only in Australia, but also in the USA and the UK. It is their first year of true independence  .Traditionally, people were given a key to their houses by their parents when they turned 21, meaning they could come and go as they like. Even though 21 is the traditional adult age in many English-speaking countries, the law nowadays is different in each country. In the UK, you can join the army at 16 and even get married at 16 if your parents allow. Young people in the UK can learn to drive a car at 17 as in Australia, although they have to wait until they are 18 to vote. In China, there is a different age for each of the stages of becoming an adult. You can vote and learn to drive a car when you are 18, but if you want to get married, women have to wait until they are 20 and men until they are 22. Chinese people celebrate important birthdays every 10 years--so when young people turn 20, they can expect a big party! No matter what age you are, becoming an adult is really about learning how to be independent and responsible . Once you are finally able to take care of yourself and make your own decisions, then you can say that you are truly all grown-ups. Why do people in Australia get the key to the houses when they really become adults?",

My grandparents never let me do any chores because they want me to do my schoolwork. I used to take everything for granted*. I never said \"thank you\" to people. As time went by, I found that my classmates didn't like me and my best friends left me. one day, I asked Leo, who used to be one of my best friends. He said that I was selfish, rude* and bad-tempered*. \"No one wants to make friends with a person who always receives but never gives anything!\" he said. I was shocked* at his words. \"Oh, no! Please don't leave me. I need friends! I will be lonely and unhappy without friends!\" I locked myself up in the room and cried. \"I want my friends back. But how?\" Then I noticed that all the popular kids in the class friendly to others. They always smile and say \"thank you\" to others. They do whatever they can to help when others are in trouble. Other kids like them and always play with them. \"I need to change! I will get my friends back,\" I said to myself. From then on, I started to change myself. I learned to say \"thank you\" to others.

        "question": "Rome had the Forum  . London has Speaker's Corner. Now always-on-the-go New Yorkers have Liz and Bill.    Liz and Bill, two college graduates in their early 20s, have spent a whole year trying to have thousands of people talk to them in subway stations and on busy street corners. And just talk.    Using a 2-foot-tall sign that says, \" Talk to Me,\" they attract conversationalists, who one evening included a mental patient, and men in business suits.    They don't collect money. They don't push religion  . So what's the point?    \" To see what happens,\" said Liz. \" We simply enjoy life with open talk.\"    Shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, they decided to walk from New York City to Washington, a 270-mile trip. They found they loved talking to people along the way and wanted to continue talking with strangers after their return.    \" It started as a crazy idea.\" Liz said. \" We were so curious about all the strangers walking by with their life stories. People will talk to us about anything: their job, their clothes, their childhood experiences, anything.\"    Denise wanted to talk about an exam she was about to take. She had stopped by for the second time in two days, to let the two listeners know how it went.    Marcia had led her husband to a serious disease. \"That was very heavy on my mind.\" Marcia said. \" To be able to talk about it to total strangers was very good,\" she explained.    To celebrate a year of talking, the two held a get-together in a city park for all the people they had met over the past year. A few hundred people appeared, as well as some television cameramen and reporters.    They may plan more parties or try to attract more people to join their informal talks. Some publishers have expressed interest in a book, something the two say they'll consider before making a decision. What will Liz and Bill do in the future?",

        "question": "The TV shows a baby's pram   rolling off a train platform as the mother makes a mad rush to save her son, but she is too late and it falls onto the rails in front of an incoming train. This heart-stopping scene happened yesterday at Ashburton station in Melbourne, Australia. But the story has a happy ending: the six-month-old baby survived with just a cut on his forehead, although the pram was dragged about 35 metres by the braking train. The nurse Jon Wright said the boy just \"needed a feed and a sleep\" and didn't need to stay in hospital. \"Luckily, he was strapped   into his pram at the time, which probably saved his life. I think the child is extremely lucky, \" Wright told theHerald Sunnewspaper after the baby was taken to hospital with minor injuries. Fortunately the train was already slowing down to stop at the station so it stopped quickly when the driver put on the brakes as soon as he saw the pram fall in front of him. Rail firm Connex is to look into how the pram rolled off the platform. The accident came one day after Connex started a child safety awareness activity warning parents to keep babies strapped into their prams at all times while on platforms. The accident happened at the same time as the \"balloon boy \"story in the US, in which a six-year-old Colorado boy was reported to be trapped in a flyaway balloon. However, he was later found hiding in the family's garage. Many people believe that it had all been a publicity _ by the parents. No such doubts surround the baby on the train platform.

As we walked toward the entrance to the restaurant, a man with a dirty face jumped up from a chair, opened the door for us and greeted us in a friendly way.

Seeing this rudeness truly upset me, I wanted to set a good example to my children, but sometimes being a good example was difficult.

Just then, the \"doorman\" was opening the door for me, I said a loud \"thank you\" to him as I exited. When I returned, we talked a bit. He said he was not allowed inside unless he bought food. I went back and told my family his situation. Then I asked our waitress to add one soup and sandwich. The kids looked puzzled, but when I said the order was for the \"doorman\", they smiled. When it was time to continue our trip, I noticed the \"doorman\" enjoying his meal. Upon seeing me, he stood up and thanked me heartily. He then lifted his hand for a handshake and I gratefully accepted. I suddenly noticed the tears in his eyes-tears of gratitude  . What happened next drew great astonishment: I gave the \"doorman\" a hug. Back in truck, I fell into deep thought. While we can't choose many things in life, we can choose when to show gratitude.

        "question": "That day It's 4 am,and Danilo C.Dequina is already awake. Holding a flashlight and a bucket, he is walking in the pre-dawn darkness along the shore of Old Poblacion Beach in the town of Maitum,Sarangani,in the far south of the Philippines.  A few minutes later,he spots a patch of sand that appears to have been disturbed by a turtle. Dequina studies the area carefully,figuring out where the eggs have been buried, and then starts digging slowly. After clearing away several centimeters of sand, he uncovers a large group of eggs,roughly the size of ping-pong balls. He picks them up and puts them in the bucket. Dequina carries the eggs to his hatchery  , some 50 meters away from the seashore. The hatchery is really just a sandy patch of land under the coconut trees enclosed by a black fine-mesh fence. It is here that he buries the turtle eggs he has collected. Today,Dequina scoops out a hole,puts the eggs in it,and covers them with sand. After 45 to 70 days, the eggs will hatch. Dequina will then carty the hatchlings to the shore,and release them into the sea. He admits to feeling sorrow as he sets the hatchlings free most are hunted down by natural predators,and just one percent survive to adulthood.  According to the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), eight species of sea turtles face extinction,including four that come to the shores of Sarangani to lay their eggs --the Hawksbill,Olive Ridley,Loggerhead and Green Turtles.  After learning about their  _ , Dequina attended a DENR training session on turtle conservation and decided to take action. He helped the local government to set up the Pawikan Nesting Sanctuary next to his house in 2003. The hatchery drew the attention of the locals. \"They started to change their attitudes towards sea turtles,\"52-year-old Dequina says. \"If they see turtle eggs,they will either bring them to me or inform me of the nesting places.\" Over the past seven years,more than 3,000 hatch- lings have been released to the ocean.

        "question": "A private sixth grade is set to start its lessons at 1.30 pm every day because the school's teacher thinks his students will study better after a morning lie-in  . Instead of rising early for a 9 am start, students at the PS15,000-a-year Hampton Court House, in East Molesey, Surrey, will get to enjoy a lie-in and work from 1.30 pm until 7pm. Head teacher Guy Holloway says the move for all sixth grade students, set to begin from September, has been made according to research by scientists. He predicts   that not only will his students aged 16 and upwards get great night's sleep, but their productivity   will also be improved. The co-educational school will have the latest start time in the UK, and will be the only one to begin lessons in the afternoon. Experts say young people are programmed to get up later, and that rather than laziness it is simply a shift   in their body clocks. 'There are 168 hours in a week and how productive they are depends on how they choose to use those hours,' said Mr Holloway. 'At Hampton Court House we don't think we have the answer for everybody; it's about what works in our school. We want to get them into a condition where they can get great sleep and study well.' He said students would also benefit from reduced journey times as they travel to and from school after rush hour  . Year 10 student Gabriel Purcell-Davis will be one of the first of 30 A-level students to start at the later time. 'I want to wake up in my bed, not in my maths lesson,' said the 15-year-old. Lessons for all other students at the school will still begin at 9 am as usual. What can we learn about the new start time?",

        "question": "Cats and dogs aren't usually friendly but they can work together well when there's a common goal. Matt Hirst's pets were recently caught on camera conspiring to open the kitchen door while the master was away. According to his post on Reddit, Hirst -- who lives in the U.K. -- had been arriving home all week to notice one of the doors open, even though he knew he shut it before he left. After the fourth time the door was open he decided to set up a hidden camera. \"The first time, I assumed I just must have left the door open. The second time, I checked the whole house thinking that someone was breaking in (and began to suspect the cat). The third time I figured it must be the cat, and decided to catch him out, so set the camera up and left it going all day,\" he wrote. Just three hours after leaving the house, the cat jumps up onto a scratch tower and starts pawing at the door. It takes the cat just over a minute to finally break through and then both cat and dog escape to the other side. Where will you probably read this passage?",

        "question": "A handsome middle-age man walked quietly into the cafe and sat down. Before he ordered, he couldn't help but noticed a group of younger men at the table next to him. It was obvious they were making fun of something about him and it isn't until he remembered he was wearing a small pink - on the lapel of his suit that he became aware of what joke was all about. The man pretend not to notice it, but the whisper and laughter began to get to him. He looked one of the rude young men straight into the eye, placed his hand beneath the ribbon and asked. \"This?\" With that the young men all began to laugh out loud. The man he spoke to said, \"Hey, sorry, man, but we were just commenting on how pretty your little pink ribbon looks against your blue jacket!\" The middle-aged man calmly invited the joker to come to his table, and politely seated him. As uncomfortable as he was, the young guy had to, not really sure why. In a soft voice, the middle-aged man said,\" I wear this ribbon to bring awareness about breast cancer. I wear it in my mother's honor.\" \"Oh, sorry. She died of breast cancer?\" \"No, she didn't.\" \"She's alive and well. But her breasts nourished me as a baby, and were a soft testing place for my head when I was scared or lonely as a little boy. I' m very grateful for my mother's breasts, and her health.\" \"Umm.\" The young replied, \"Yeah.\" \"And I wear this ribbon to honor my life,\" the man continued. \"And she's okay, too0?\" the young guy asked. \"Oh, yes. She's fine. Her breasts have been a great source of loving pleasure for both of us, and with them she nurtured and nourished our daughter 23 years ago. I'm grateful for my wife's breasts, and her health.\" \"Uh, huh, and I guess you wear it to honor your daughter, also?\" \"No. it's too late to honor my daughter by wearing it now...\" Shaken and ashamed, the young guy said, \"Oh, I'm so sorry, mister.\" \"So, in my daughter's memory, too, I proudly wear this little ribbon, which allows me the opportunity to enlighten others. And here...\" with this he reached in his pocket and handed the young man a little pink ribbon.

        "question": "Do you know that people without friends are more likely to die an early death? It's true.However,not all the friends are helpful to up your chances of living a long,happy life. The following types of friends are just what you need to keep the doctor away. A Loyal Best Friend Sometimes a loyal best friend is the only thing you need to stay calm. Everyone needs a non-judgmental friend who will support them no matter what.This is the kind of friend who knows all of your deepest and darkest secrets, but still loves you all the same. An Honest Confidant There are certain situations in life where we need to hear the harsh truth. It is really hard for you to face it, but that's what the honest confidant is for. Friends are supposed to be honest with each other. If you find someone who is bravely honest with you (in a constructive way), then hold on to this person! People like that are hard to come by these days. A Polar Opposite If you only develop friendships with others who follow the same beliefs, customs, and values as you do, chances are you're kept away from the rest of the world. Try to break out of your comfortable zone and befriend people who hold opposing views. You'll learn to accept people who don't see the world exactly the way you see it.  A Work Pal Do you know that with a full--time job, you spend at least 50%of your waking hours at work? Depressing, isn't it? The more isolated you are at work, the more depressed you get. That's why it makes sense to get a work pal to chat with to help you get through the week. You spend 50%of your waking hours at work, and so does your work pal. You'll find it much easier to complain about work with someone than to eat lunch alone every day. With them in your life, you're bound to live a long and happy life!

        "question": "Yu Pengnian is an 88-year-old real estate Chinese businessman. He amassed  a fortune of $1.3 billion dollars during his career but instead of keeping the money and living like an emperor, he decided to give it all away. All of his fortune will be spent on helping poor Chinese students get a better education. And Yu isn't the only super-rich person in China who has this spirit of giving. Chen Guangbiao, a Jiangsu recycling tycoon, has given millions of dollars to charity  and promises to give all of his money to charity when he dies.    Yu and Chen are among the many businessmen who have become prosperous during China's economic rise. An American business magazine, Forbes, estimates that there are 117 billionaires in China and hundreds of thousands of millionaires. What sets Yu and Chen apart from the rest, though, is their tremendous generosity(,) when it comes to donating money to charity.    Last week Bill Gates and Warren Buffett came to Beijing. Gates and Buffett, two of the world's richest men, are also the world's biggest philanthropists. They invited fifty of China's richest people to have dinner with them and talk about the spirit of giving. At first, only a few people accepted their invitation. It seemed some of the invited guests were afraid that Buffett and Gates were going to pressure them into giving their wealth to charity.    A lot of people are angry at the billionaires who are not willing to give away their fortunes. They  _ hem for being miserly and not caring about the poor and the less fortunate. But I think this criticism is wrong. A gift, any gift, should come from the heart. Instead of criticism, these reluctant billionaires should be encouraged to follow the examples of Yu Pengnian and Chen Guangbiao. Encouragement is always a better strategy than criticism. As we say in English, \"You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.\" Yu Pengnian will spend all of his fortune in   _",

        "question": "These days, young children can enjoy directly what it is like to be a marine biologist   at a marine association. What they discover can lead them to appreciate and protect the ocean and also the animals living in it. At the present time, learning isn't only limited to the classroom. It's quite common for kids to learn from outdoor experiences. Teachers commonly take their pupils on field trips to museums as well as other interesting areas. If you wish to help pupils to take care of the ocean, one of the best areas to take them to is a marine association, the place where the ocean biome   is shown. Taking your pupils to a marine association is a prefect way to help them learn. Education professionals agree that there are topics that children can learn more successfully whenever they experience them directly. Several organizations that focused on protecting the ocean now operate on the coast of different areas in America and all around the world. It's quite common for marine associations nowadays to open their doors several times a week to kids, parents, and ocean lovers to learn more about the ocean biome. A marine association has different programs for children of different ages. You'll find programs that are developed specially for pupils. Pupils are involved in interactive   learning. This learning experience allows young children to recognize the value of the role each species performs in their environment. They not only get to research creatures from the ocean, but they also get to see, touch, and smell most of these animals and plants. This type of _ offers students an idea about the life of a marine scientist. It could help them choose a career afterwards. These programs are generally held on Saturdays and Sundays in order that kids and parents can have more hours in which to have fun. Teachers who want to arrange these activities for their students can call a local marine association near them. Which of the following is TURE?",

        "question": "Not being the best but touching the limits of your ability. This belief came from my third grade teacher, the most trusted and loved person in my life. Mr. Myrus was always perfectly dressed and spoke with the conviction   that talking to small kids didn't mean that he had to sacrifice proper pronunciation or grammar. And he was demanding. Oh, he wasn't unreasonable or cruel; he simply felt that no matter what your best was, you should achieve it. As luck would have it, I met him again as my eighth grade math teacher. I was not, nor ever will be, gifted in math. And thirteen-year-old girls do not have the energy to devote to something like square roots  . I remember our struggles, \"I don't know the answer. I can't do it.!\" \"Perhaps you don't know the answer,\" he would say quietly. \"Do you think we might figure it out together? How do you know what you can do until you try?\" Mr. Myrus lived around the corner, and I would often stop by to talk while he worked in his wood shop. In this room of sawdust, wood chips, and the smoke from the woodburning stove, I felt respected and valued as a person. I knew there was someone who liked me for who I was, someone who, while he always wanted me to do my best, let me know that if I had really tried, that was enough. Mr. Myrus was my teacher and my friend. He taught me to be kind. He taught me my own value. He taught me about honor, about truth, and about doing my best--and that all feelings and beliefs have dignity and deserve respect. And of all the things I know, this I believe: We can't all be \"the\" best, but we can, each of us, be our best, and I know that's true because Mr. Myrus told me.

        "question": "People have always wanted to speak with animals. There are many books about this, especially children books. Now there are also movies, such as Dr. Doolittle. When you watch animals, it seems clear that they can communicate with each other. Many people wonder why people can't also communicate with them.    Scientists know how some animals communicate. Bees, for example, use their bodies. They do a kind of dance to give information about food. Birds, on the other hand, share information with sounds. They use certain sounds to protect their homes and to stay together when they fly. Some male birds use lovely songs to attract a female . Other animals communicate with both body movements and sounds. For example, dogs wag their tails when they are happy, and they bark when they are excited.    People used to think it was possible to teach human language to animals. Parrots and other birds, for example, can learn to say words. But the birds just repeat the words. They don't understand them. Some American scientists tried to teach English to chimpanzees , close  s of human beings. However, this was impossible. Chimpanzees can't move their mouths the right way. They could never learn to speak like people.    Then scientists tried to teach human language to chimpanzees in other ways. Some tried with American Sign Language (ASL). Others tried with a simple computer. But chimpanzees could only learn to use a few words. They could never learn to use grammar. Their brains are very different from the brains of human beings.    Now some scientists are studying the same points between human and animal language. In fact, some animals use sounds like people do. Dogs, for example, use an unpleasant, low sound to tell other dogs to stay away. People, too, use that kind of voice to say the same things. A dog's noisy bark communicate that something is happening. People use the same high tone when they shout, \"Watch out!\"    Scientists want to understand the language of other animals, such as whales and bears. To do this, they go out to the animals' natural homes. They watch the animals for days or even years. They take pictures and make tape recordings and share the information with other scientists. In this way, they hope to learn more about the way animals communicate, and maybe someday we'll be able to communicate better with them. This passage is mainly about   _  .",

Before becoming president, Obama was a lawyer, a college professor, and a successful writer---his two memories have become best-sellers. What's more, he has some secret weapons. Teleprompter: Obama doesn't go anywhere without his Teleprompter. The textbook-sized panes of glass holding the president's prepared remarks follow him wherever he goes to speak. Writing team: Obama has a team of people who write his speeches. The writers chat with Obama for hours about what he wants to say. They listen to recordings of past presidential speeches and seek advice from advisers. Obama usually edits and rewrites the drafts several times. Tricks for lighthearted speeches: Make fun of the guests: Obama starts his speech by gently teasing his guests. His opening lines draw the audience's attention while giving them an opportunity to relax and laugh at themselves and each other. Make fun of yourself: A good rule for speechmakers: If you're going to make a joke about someone else, be sure to make one about yourself, too. Obama mocks  his own poor choices for filling the position of Commerce Secretary, saying, \"No president in history has ever named three Commerce Secretaries this quickly.\" In fact, his first two nominees for the position withdrew  their names for different reasons. In a process that had otherwise gone smoothly, the Obama Administration found it hard to deal with the problem of filling the Commerce seat.

        "question": "It is common for older people to forget things. Now an American study has found that memory starts to fail when we are young adults. People younger than thirty years of age usually do not know that they are starting to forget information. But scientists from the University of Michigan say the loss of memory has usually already started. Researchers say people do not observe this slow reduction in mental ability until the loss affects their everyday activities. Denise Park led the new study. She directs the Centre for Aging and Cognition at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Her team studied more than 350 men and women between the ages of twenty and ninety years. The study identified people in their middle twenties with memory problems. She says young adults do not know they are forgetting things because their brains have more information than they need. But she says that people in their twenties and thirties are losing memory at the same rate as people in their sixties and seventies. Ms. Park says people between the ages of sixty and seventy may note the decrease in their mental abilities. They begin to observe that they are having more trouble remembering and learning new information. The study found that older adults are more likely to remember false information as being true. For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages. She is studying what parts of the brain older adults use for different activities compared to younger adults. Ms. Park says mental performance is a direct result of brain activity and brain structure. She says keeping the brain active is important. She hopes future studies will identify ways to improve the operation of our aging minds. The passage is meant to   _  .",

        "question": "There are many theories about how drama   came into being in ancient Greece. The one most widely accepted today is based on the assumption that drama developed gradually from ceremonies. The argument for this view goes as follows. In the beginning, human beings viewed the natural forces of the world as unpredictable, and they sought through various means to control these unknown powers. Those measures which appeared to bring the desired results were then kept and repeated until they hardened into fixed ceremonies. Eventually stories arose which explained the mysteries of the ceremonies. As time passed, some of them were abandoned, but the stories, later called myths  , provided materials for art and drama Those who believe that drama came out of ceremonies also argue that those ceremonies contained the seed of theater because music, dance, and masks were almost always used. In addition, there were performers, and, since considerable importance was attached to avoiding mistakes in the rules of ceremonies, religious leaders usually assumed that task. Wearing masks, they often impersonated   other people, animals, or supernatural beings, and performed the desired effect by gestures -- success in hunt or battle, the coming rain, the revival   of the Sun -- as an actor might. Eventually such dramatic representations were separated from religious activities. Another theory finds out the theater came from the human Interest in storytelling. According to this view, tales (about the hunt, war, or other events) are gradually formed, at first through the use of impersonation, action, and dialogue by a speaker and then through the assumption of each of the roles by a different person A closely related theory about drama _ those dances that are primarily rhythmical and gymnastic or that are imitations   of animal movements and sounds.

The government of central Hunan Province.one of the areas hardest hit by the worst weather in half a century,said that it would offer a subsidy of 5,000 yuan(694 U. S. dollars)to each household whose residence was destroyed.Around 67,000 houses in prefix = st1 /Hunancollapsed in the snowy weather,which persisted from mid-January through late in the month.

        "question": "Technology has totally transformed our ability to communicate with each other. Linking to each other both literally and figuratively, many of us connect through cell phones, email, instant messaging, blogs, and networking web sites, yet we may be less connected to each other than we think. According to a study, Americans are becoming increasingly socially isolated  . The study suggests, for example, that one quarter of Americans say that they have no one to discuss important personal issues with, and that the number of close friends that Americans have has dropped from three to two. Meanwhile, the Boston Globe reports that this spreading isolation is experienced more sharply among those with less education, people of color, and older Americans. Unsurprisingly, those who are young, white, and well educated tend to have stronger social networks. From my own experience I have to say that I've never felt more connected, thanks to a web of friends, family, and colleagues. One of my closest friends is someone I met through an online discussion group who lives hundreds of miles away from me. We have met face-to-face only twice, yet our regular electronic correspondence and cell phone calls maintain our close friendship. And, speaking of blogging, my blog has introduced me to people I would never have met otherwise and has led to enduring and important friendships. On the other hand, I recently saw a scene unfold that proved to me how deeply disconnected we as Americans have become. I had just wrapped up a presentation on mediation at a family therapy  center. As I was leaving, I noticed a mother and her teenage son who had just completed their session with their family therapist. After making their next appointment, they both took out their cell phones, placed calls, and began loud conversations with whoever was on the other end. I walked out behind them to the parking lot to my car. They both jumped into their cars, and, as I saw them drive off, they were still talking on their cell phones. But, alas, not to each other. What is true about the mother and son in the passage?",

        "question": "There are several reasons why some people enjoy a better standard of living than other people. Then again, some people work very hard for their entire life and only are able to pay their monthly living expenses. As a matter of fact, they usually end up working until the last day they are alive. On the other hand, many people who are well off, so to speak, and through no fault of their own, experience a rapid decline of their standard of living due to an unexpected disaster, poor health and /or a severe economic depression within the country in which they live. Additionally, well-educated people usually earn more money during their active working years and thus are able to save a great deal of money in which to support themselves after they retire from the work force. People also become wealthy as a result of their own determination or they inherit wealth from elder family members, or they simply continue to work in the business that past generations of their family worked within. It is also true that a person can simply be a lucky dog who wins a lottery or some such contests that give a great deal of wealth to the winner. Let us not forget about the self-made individuals who have a dream of achieving fame and fortune and, after many years truly hard work, are well-rewarded for their continued efforts. An example of whom is the person who wrote the Harry Potter novels. She was just an average person who became a billionaire. So too, Ray Croc, the founder of a chain of fast food restaurants, became rich and famous at a time in life when most people retire from the workforce. Bill Gates is another person, who, by his own determination, skill and hard work, became rich and famous, as well as Ben Franklin and Thomas Edison. As you can see, there are many ways in which to become wealthy and enjoy an above average standard of living. However, those who are motivated by greed and become criminals as a result of such greed end up causing harm to others, as they continue to suck the wealth out of other people within the society. Those criminals simply take all that they get and give back little or nothing in return. What is your plan for achieving financial security, happiness, fame, and fortune? Who might be admired by the author based on the text?",

        "question": "We spend a quarter of our lives asleep. Sleep is necessary for the body to rest, yet our brains continue to process information. Studies have shown that students are more successful when they sleep after studying-instead of pulling all-nighters-because the brain reviews information learned. Similarly, dreaming is an opportunity to work out emotional problems and form thoughts and memories. About 25 percent of the time spent sleeping is spent in rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. This type of sleep is known for when dreams occur, but it also helps energize the brain and body. Researchers have found two important factors regarding humans and sleep: basicsleep need and sleep debt. Basic sleep need is the amount of sleep we need to have regularly to perform at our best. Sleep debt is the loss of sleep. A few studies say that most adults function best with a basic sleep need of seven to eight hours a night. The problem is that sleep debt also factors in, just because that you meet your basic sleep needs a few nights of the week doesn't mean it cancels out the effects of one night's sleep debt. Of course, everyone is different and some people require more or less sleep than the standard basic sleep need. But the real problem lies in what lack of sleep does over the long period to people who either does not meet his or her body's needs or for one reason or another doesn't get enough regular sleep. It is more possible for these people to have motor vehicle accidents, weight gain and risk for heart disease or diabetes   and may be at increased risk for psychological conditions such as depression or drug abuse.

        "question": "Background music may seem harmless, but it can have a powerful effect on those who hear it. Recorded background music first found its way into factories, shops and restaurants in the USA. Very soon it spread to other parts of the world. Now it is becoming difficult to go shopping or eat a meal without listening to background music. To begin with, background music was intended simply to create a soothing   atmosphere. Recently, however, it's becoming a big business. An American marketing expert has shown that music can boost  sales or increase factory production by as much as a third. But it has to be the light music. Lively music has no effect at all on sales. Slow music can increase receipts  by 34%. This is probably because shoppers slow down and have more opportunity to spot items they would like to buy. Yet, slow music isn't always the answer. The expert found that in restaurants slow music meant customers took longer to eat their meals, which reduced overall sales. So restaurant owners might be well advised to play faster music to keep the customers moving-unless, of course, the resulting indigestion  leads to complaints. Restaurant owners are advised to play   _   to increase overall sales.",

        "question": "While reading a book in English, every few lines of text, you run across a word or two that you don't know. You look up every new word in the dictionary. Bad move. All that does slow you down. Even electric or CD -ROM dictionaries can get in the way of your reading progress. A dictionary is like a road map. It can help you if you get lost and point you in the right direction. But if you stop to look at the \"map\" each time you take a step, you'll get nowhere fast. On your English learning \"journey\", a dictionary can be a helpful \"travel companion \"--if it is not overused. To help you start thinking in English, use an English-to-English dictionary. Otherwise, you will always depend on your native language and end up translating in your head. A good dictionary can help you do more than just find the meaning of a word. It can help you verify  spelling, check word forms and grammar usage, find example sentence and learn pronunciation. Some dictionaries even provide exercises to teach you how to use their resources. Take time to get to know your dictionary. Learn the pronunciation symbols. Understand what the abbreviations   mean. Try to master the important grammar rules. Look for charts, diagrams and lists might be useful in the future. You will discover how helpful it can be to make friends with your dictionary. And as they say, \"A friend in need is a friend indeed.\" Why do we need a good English-to-English dictionary?",

        "question": "Once there was an 11-year-old boy who went fishing with his father in the middle of a New Hampshire lake. On the day before bass   season opened, they were fishing early in the evening, catching other fish with worms. Then the boy tied on a small silver lure   and put it into the lake. Suddenly he felt that something very big pulling on the lure. His father watched with admiration as the boy skillfully brought the fish beside the bank. Finally he lifted the tired fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a bass. The boy and his father looked at the big fish. The father lit a match and looked at his watch. It was 10 p.m.--two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy. \"You'll have to put it back, son,\" he said. \"Dad!\" cried the boy. \"There will be other fish,\" said his father. \"Not as big as this one,\" cried the boy. He looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were in sight in the moonlight. He looked again at his father. Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he had caught the fish, the boy could tell from his father's voice that the decision couldn't be changed. He threw the huge bass into the black water. The big fish disappeared. The boy thought that he would never again see such a big fish. That was 34 years ago. Today the boy is a successful architect in New York City. He often takes his own son and daughters to fish at the same place. And he was right. He has never again caught such a large fish as the one he got that night long ago. But he does see that same fish ... again and again ... every time he has an ethical   decision to make. For, as his father had taught him, ethics are simple matters of right and wrong. It is only the practice of ethics that is difficult. What happened when the big fish turned out to be a bass?",

        "question": "Chinese writer Mo Yan's Nobel Prize for Literature might _ an explosion of global interest in Chinese literature and lead to more titles translated into English, European experts say. \"Hopefully, the award means more people will read Chinese literature and more works will get translated,\" says Michel Hockx, professor of the Languages and Cultures of China and Inner Asia from University of London. \"Many very good Chinese writers have been accepted globally for a long time already. Mo Yan is probably the most translated Chinese writer alive, with at least five of his novels made available in English over the past 20 years.\" Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of bookseller Foyles, says Mo's win coincides with growing interest in Chinese literature and recognizes the talents of a distinctive and visionary writer. \"We are very excited by the fact that English translations of more of his books should now become available,\" Ruppin says. He made the comment after Mo became the first Chinese citizen to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in its century-long history. As East-West cultural exchange has been booming, Chinese literature has been attracting growing attention in recent years. Hockx explains, \"It's mainly because there are many more opportunities for Chinese writers to visit other countries, to publish their works outside China and to interact with readers abroad. At the same time, more and more people globally are learning Chinese and taking an interest in the Chinese language and culture.\" University of Oxford lecturer in modern Chinese literature Margaret Hillenbrand says, \"The obvious reason for the growing global presence of Chinese literature is the growing global presence of China itself. People have come to realize that there is a serious knowledge deficit between China and its international counterparts -- in particular, _ -- and reading Chinese literature is an effective, simple means of solving that gap.\" Which of the following is true according to the passage?",

        "question": "One sunny day last September, Tim heard some shouting. Looking out to the sea carefully, he saw a couple of kids in a rowboat were being pulled out to sea. Two 12-year-old boys, Christian and Jack, rowed out a boat to search for a football. Once they'd rowed beyond the calm waters, a beach umbrella tied to the boat caught the wind and pulled the boat into open water. The pair panicked and tried to row back to shore. But they were no match for _ and the boat was out of control.

Every 500 yards or so, he raised his head to judge his progress. \"At one point, I considered turning back,\" he says. \"I wondered if I was putting my life at risk.\" After 30 minutes of struggling, he was close enough to yell to the boys, \"Take down the umbrella!\" Christian made much effort to take down the umbrella. Then Tim was able to catch up and climb aboard the boat. He took over rowing, but the waves were almost too strong for him. \"Let's aim for the pier ,\" Jack said. Tim turned the boat toward it. Soon afterward, waves crashed over the boat, and it began to sink. \"Can you guys swim?\" he cried. \"A little bit,\" the boys said. Once the were in the water, Tim decided it would he safer and faster for him to pull the boys toward the pier. Christian and Jack were wearing life jackets and floated on their backs.

        "question": "\"Selfie\"   joins ranks of dictionary words. In 2002, an Australian man went to his friend's 21st birthday party. He got drunk, _ on some steps and cut his lip. He took a picture of his injuries and shared it with his friends on an online forum. \"And sorry about the focus,\" he wrote, \"it was a selfie.\" That was the first recorded use of the word \"selfie\", according to linguistic experts at Oxford Dictionaries. On Nov 19, Oxford Dictionaries declared \"selfie\" Word of the Year for 2013, in honor of the term having taken over the world thanks to millions of smart phone self-portraits and the resulting shares on social media. So what does the choice of the word say about our culture? Mary Elizabeth Williams, writing in Salon magazine, says the word reminds us that contemporary culture is defined by our narcissism .Megan Jackson from a local newspaper points out a selfie may only focus on appearance. Selfies invite judgment based on appearance alone. What kind of cultural influence does this have on women? Erin Gloria Ryan on Jezebel says selfies teach young woman to obsess over their appearance and judge themselves on the basis of beauty rather than accomplishments. \"They're a reflection of the warped way we teach girls to see themselves as decorative,\" said Ryan. In Slate magazine, Rachel Simmons has the opposite view. She argues that selfies are an example of young women promoting themselves and taking control of their own self-presentation. Think of each one, she says, as \"a tiny pulse of girl pride --a shout-out to the self\". Who holds a positive opinion towards selfie in the life of women?",

        "question": "By today's standards, my mobile phone is pretty rubbish. It's a Nokia 1616. If that doesn't mean much to you ( it's not the kind of phone you see advertised on television) ,all you need to know is that it's a small, not very heavy device with which you can send and receive telephone calls and text messages. It also has a very handy torch on the top for when you can't find your keys, or when you drop something on the floor in the cinema. Apart from that, my phone doesn't do much. Well, it has an alarm, and it probably has a calculator and things like that, but it's nothing compared to a smartphone. Why would I want one of those?    I have often been told that the big advantage of having a smartphone is that \" you can do everything with them!\" But when was the last time you saw someone doing \"everything\" with a smartphone? Okay, so they may have an endless list of functions, but generally they are used for checking social networking sites, playing games, and receiving and replying to emails. I'm happy just doing all of those things at home on my laptop.    As far as I can tell, the best thing about having a smartphone is that you can be connected to the internet all the time. Don't get me wrong, I love the internet, but I just don't see the point of constantly being online. I can't remember the last time I received a Facebook update which was so urgent that I had to read it as soon as it appeared, and I can't imagine ever having a job which was so important that I would need to read work-related emails immediately. I would think that if someone needed me urgently, they would just ring me rather than send an email. And my trusty Nokia can manage that.    One of the most peculiar effects of the smartphone is, in my opinion, the newly-found addiction to maps and navigation   systems. Is there anything more boring than knowing exactly where you are all of the time? How do you get to know an area if you don't get lost there a few times? And if you are dependent on online maps, what happens to those great places you find just by chance? You can't exactly find out from google maps the journey from \"here\" to \"that hidden cafe with the tasty-looking cakes\", or to \"that pond next to the church which looks really pretty in the evening sun. \" It is, of course, true that we all occasionally need to be pointed in the right direction, but I find that there are often real life humans you can ask.   There are many benefits of having a very basic mobile phone, like the face that it cost me about twenty pounds, and that I don't have to worry too much about it being stolen. But the main benefit has to be the fact that it provides me with the world's greatest excuse for my bad habits. Whether it's turning up late to events, or getting lost on a trip, or missing buses or trains, or forgetting about an appointment at work. I'm pretty sure I'm covered with the following explanation \"I'm really sorry, but I don't have a smartphone.\" The writer uses his Nokia 1616 mainly to   _  .",

        "question": "There was a 17% fall in the number of first year undergraduates at UK universities in the first year of higher tuition fees, official figures show. In 2012-13 UK universities were allowed to _ their yearly fees to PS9,000. England saw a 12% fall in new full-time undergraduate students overall. The government acknowledged the fall but stressed that demand for full time higher education has already \"returned to record levels\". A spokesperson for Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said the figures were influenced by a higher number of students taking up places the previous year, rather than having a gap year. \"A reduction in entrants in 2012 was well documented and the numbers were affected by the significant number of students who opted not to defer their place from the year before,\" she said. 'Direct consequence' The decline had not continued into the current year, she added. \"Application rates for some of the most disadvantaged young people have risen to an all time high in England and more students than ever before are being successful in securing a place at their first choice institution.\" The figures, collated by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa), are official confirmation of other indications that there was a fall in the number of people going to university last year.

        "question": "The Internet, mobile phones and iPads are parts of our lives now. Technology is greatly affecting all ways of our lives, from the ways we work to the ways we play. And it even causes a number of social problems such as cloning   humans. We have had lots of technology and it has changed our lives a lot. We are sure that humans will continue to use more and more technology. Here are some examples of modern technology that will change our ideas and will affect our lives greatly. Global Positioning System (GPS)   It's a system that uses radio signals from satellites to show exact   information.   It tells you where the user is on the earth in all weather conditions.  It's made up of three parts: satellites, control equipments   on land and receivers. Space Technology Russian and American scientists have worked together for the International Space Station, (ISS) for a long time. They hope the ISS will provide a long-lasting lab. Such a lab will bring humans limitless   advantages. It's even hoped that one day space technology will take humans to their new houses in space. Underwater Robot Hercules is a kind of underwater robot with some high technology equipments. It will be used to search for ancient ships which were destroyed into the deep sea during their journey long ago. The world is changing so quickly that it's hard for us to catch up with all the new inventions because they seem to come out every month. It's important for us to learn about new technology and the role that it plays in our lives. So we should be willing to accept modem technology, or we will fall behind the times.

        "question": "When something goes wrong, it  can be very satisfying to say, \"Well, it's soandso's fault.\"or \"I know I'm late, but it's not my fault; the car broke down.\"It is probably not your fault, but once you form the habit of blaming somebody or something else for a bad situation, you are a loser. You have no power and could do nothing that helps change the situation. However, you can have great power over what happens to you if you stop focusing on whom to blame and start focusing on how to _ the situation.This is the winner's key to success. Winners are great at overcoming problems. For example, if you were late because your car broke down, maybe you need to have your car examined more regularly. Or,you might start to carry along with you the useful phone numbers, so you could call for help when in need. For another example, if your colleague causes you problems on the job for lack of responsibility or ability, find ways of dealing with his irresponsibility or inability rather than simply blame the person. Ask to work with a different person, or don't rely on this person. You should accept that the person is not reliable and find creative ways to work successfully regardless of how your colleague fails to do his job well. This is what being a winner is all about--creatively using your skills and talents so that you are successful no matter what happens. Winners don't have fewer problems in their lives; they have just as many difficult situations to face as anybody else. They are just better at seeing those problems as challenges and opportunities to develop their own talents. So,stop focusing on \"whose fault it is.\"Once you are confident about your power over bad situations, problems are just stepping stone for success.

An ABC is a Chinese, but was born in the United States. Sometimes, people also call them \"banana persons\". A banana is yellow outside and white inside. So when a person is a banana, he or she is white (American) inside and yellow (Chinese) outside. They are born in America and they live in America for a long time. Even their nationalities  are Americans. So they think like Americans and do things like Americans. But they still have Chinese blood. Their parents, grandparents or great-grandparents were from China. They all have black eyes and black hair. So they look like us, Chinese people. For example, we all know the famous scientist C.N.

        "question": "As millions of playthings are recalled, doctors are reminded that the risks of lead exposure continue for young patients. Lead is such a well-known health - perhaps even contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire- that it came as a shock to discover that toys played by children could contain lead. Doctors are now dealing with the aftershocks. Just how dangerous is this exposure? That's the question physicians are being asked by parents who find a lead-polluted Elmo, of Dora. Millions of others toys, lunch boxes and pieces of jewelry manufactured in China have been recalled because they contain lead either in the paint that coats them or as a component of the plastic used to make the item more flexible. The lead content in some of the toys recalled this summer was 180 times the amount allowed by law. Some pieces of jewelry were almost 100% lead. Experts advise that the items do cause a risk and that doctors should urge parents to check the comprehensive lists of recalled products on the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Web site and return any appearing on those lists to the manufacturers. If exposure is suspected, a blood test is in order . Since there is no safe level of this universal   element, the risk face by children for lead poisoning and its accompanying threat of learning disabilities and behavior problems is considerable. Doctors who have toys in their waiting rooms also are advised to see if any of them have been recalled and to check for chipped, flaking paint-even on those that haven't yet been recalled--since new announcements of toy risk continue.

        "question": "Starting next month, people in prefix = st1 /Washingtonwill be able to rent a bicycle day and night with a membership card. A new company called SmartBike will make 120 bicycles available at 10 spots in the city. \"There's a lot of stress on our transit systems,\" said Jim Sebastian, who manages bicycle and pedestrian programs forWashington's Transportation Department. Offering another choice, Mr Sebastian said, \"It will help us reduce traffic jam and pollution, as well as parking problems.\" In the deal, the company will have the advertising rights in the city's bus shelters and it has reached a similar deal with San Erancisco. Chicago andPortland,Ore., are also considering the program. For a $40 annual membership fee, SmartBike users can check out three-speed bicycles for three hours at a time. The program will not provide helmets   but does encourage their use. Similar programs have proved successful in Europe. The Ve1ib program in Paris and Bicing in Barcelona, Spain, both started around a year ago and already offer thousands of bicycles. Mr Sebastian, who started trying to bring bike-sharing to Washington even before its success in Paris and Barcelona, said he believed that the program could grow within a year and hoped that it would eventually offer 1 000 bicycles. \"But studies showed that many bikes would get stolen in a day, or within a few weeks,\" said Paul DeMaio, a Washington-area bike-sharing consultant. Improved technology allows programs to better protect bicycles. In Washington, SmartBike users who keep bicycles longer than the three-hour maximum will receive demerits and could eventually lose renting privileges. Bicycles gone for more than 48 hours will be considered lost, with the last user charged a $200 replacement fee. The low cost could be one of the program's major selling points.

        "question": "Television will turn 86 years old on September 7, 2013, and it has never looked better. In its youth, television was a piece of furniture with a tiny, round screen showing unclear pictures of  lowbudget programs. In spite of its shortcomings, it became well-received. Between 1950 and 1963, the number of American families with a television jumped from 9% to 92% of the population. As the audience got larger, the technology got better. Television sets became more reliable through the 1960s. Both of the reception and the picture improved. The major networks started broadcasting programs in color. Even greater improvements were coming according to Sanford Brown, who wrote an article forthe Postin 1967. Surprisingly, just about every prediction he made in the article became a reality. For example: All sets in the notdistant future will be color instruments. He also predicted that TV sets would become smaller, simpler, more reliable and less expensive and may forever put the TV repairman out of work. Smaller sets do not, of course, mean smaller screens. TV engineers expect screens to get much bigger. However, today's 3D TV is even farther away, if it's coming at all.  There is some doubt whether the public would be eager to pay for it, in view of people's cold reception given to 3D movies. But the technology with the greatest potential, according to Brown, was cable television  , which was still in its early stages then. As he predicted, the future of cable television was highly interactive. It wasn't cable television that gave Americans their electronic connection to the world, however. It was the Internet.  He even foresaw the future office: using picture phones, bigscreen televisions for conferences, and computers providing information, at the touch of a button. Brown ever said, \"The future of television is no longer a question of what we can invent. It's a question of what we want.\" Which of the followings did Sanford Brown fail to predict?",

        "question": "Worried about how many calories you will get in that piece of pizza, chocolate cake or bag of chips? A new iphone application Mealsnap may help. Users just need to take a picture of the meal with the phone, and it will give a calorie read-out almost immediately. Mealsnap was developed by DailyBurn, a health social network that focuses on helping its users lead healthier lifestyles. It has created several other health and diet-related iphone applications. The applications gives users a quick reply. To do that, it matches the taken picture to a databank containing the calorie information of nearly 500,000 kinds of food. Users then get the range of calories for the meal that is photographed. We started with something simple -- an apple. A couple of minutes later the application replied that it was an apple and between 64 and 96 calories. More impressive was the reply we received after sending a photo of mixed salad bowl. Mealsnap replied that the bowl contained \"yellow rice with corn, boiled eggs and beans\" and that the food was between 532 and 798 calories. Mr. Smith, director of DailyBurn, said that usual calorie counting needed a long time, but that the application made it easier to know the calories in food. That's why it is so popular among those who are trying hard to lose weight. In addition, Mealsnap can serve as a food diary. No need to write down what they've eaten, the photos will be stored. Then users can keep a visual log  . Mr. Smith said: \"It's like a food journal, but easier. All you do is to take the picture. The simple act of recording something can cause a psychological change that can help people on their health journey. Knowing the calorie range makes me think more about what I'm eating. 60.

A 13-year-old Russian, Daniil Korotkikh, was walking with his parents on a beach when he saw something lying in the sand. \"I saw that bottle and it looked interesting,\" Korotkikh told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \"it looked like a German beer bottle and there was a message inside. \" It said, \"My name is Frank, and I'm five years old. My dad and I are traveling on a ship to Denmark. If you find this letter, please write back to me, and I will write back to you.\" The letter, dated 1987, included an address in the town of Coesfeld. The boy in the letter, Frank Uesbeck, is now 29. His parents still live at the letter's address. The Russian boy and the German man met each other earlier this month through an internet video link. The Russian boy said he did not believe that the bottle actually spent 24 years in the sea. He believed it had been hidden under the sand where he found it for a long time. Uesbeck was especially happy that he was able to have a positive effect on a life of a young person far away from Germany. \"It's really a wonderful story,\" he said. \"And who knows? Perhaps one day we will actually be able to arrange a meeting in person. \" When the German boy threw the bottle into the sea,   _  .",

        "question": "Years ago there was a group of kids who would hang around at some local ponds  in the woods near their houses in Warwick, Rhode Island. In summer they caught frogs and fish. When winter arrived they couldn't wait to go skating. Time passed, and the ponds became the only open space for the kids to enjoy themselves in that neighborhood. One day a thirteen-year-old boy from this group of kids read in the local newspaper that a developer wanted to fill in the ponds and build over a hundred small houses called apartments. So the boy went door to door and gathered more than two hundred signatures to stop the development. A group of citizens met and decided to support him. At the meeting of the town planning organization,the boy was quite nervous at first and spoke very softly. But when he saw the faces of his friends and neighbors in the crowd and thought about what was happening to their favorite ponds,his voice grew louder. He told the town officials that they should speak for the citizens. He also insisted that they should leave enough space for children. A few days later,the developer stopped his plan. Nine years later, when that teen was a senior in college, he was informed that the developer was back with his proposal to build apartments. Now twenty-two years old, he was studying wetlands ecology. He again appeared before the town planning organization. This time as an expert, he used environmental protection laws to explain _ on development in and around wetlands and the knowledge of wetlands ecology to help to improve the development. Finally some apartments were built, but less than half the number the developer wanted. The ponds where those kids used to hang around were protected by a piece of natural land, and are still there today. The kids liked to   _   at the local ponds in winter.",

        "question": "From the time we were babies we have been taught manners. We are taught how to hold a knife and fork and not to talk with our mouths full. We are taught how to shake hands and when to stand and when to sit and the way to introduce people. Sometimes good manners in one place are very bad manners somewhere else. Almost everywhere eating together means that people are very friendly to each other. But in parts of Polynesia it is bad manners to be seen eating beside each other. So they politely turn their backs to each other when they are taking food. Some East Africans spit four times as a kind of blessing .They do it to show that they want a sick person to get well,or to bless a new-born baby. In most other places,spitting means something completely different. It usually shows an unhealthy habit. In many countries,it may mean that you hate someone. When we go to visit someone we say \" Hello!\" Or \" How are you ? \" or things like that. But if you are visiting an East African village , everyone will be very careful not to pay attention to you, The polite thing there will be for you to go quietly,without speaking to anyone, and sit beside your friend. You should wait until he has finished what he is doing and then he will begin talking to you. In a village in Arab , a visitor will walk behind all the tents until he gets to the one he wants to visit. If he passes in front , he will be invited into each tent and asked to eat. It is rude to refuse. From this passage we know  _  .",

What's worse, while there are around 6,000 or 7,000 languages spoken around the world today, researchers estimate that fifty percent of those languages will not survive the turn of the century. Google, however, is determined to provide a safe place for some of these dying languages. Recently, the company started the Endangered Languages Project. It is an online archive  that will use technology and media to protect endangered languages around the world. Google hopes the archive will allow people to do something for endangered languages by offering tools that will help create high-quality recordings of the last speakers of a language.  The site makes it possible for users to share research and video documents that will support endangered languages, as well as connect people who are working to protect specific languages. Languages on the site are put into different types, such as, \"at risk\", \"endangered\" and \"seriously endangered\". Navajo, a language spoken mainly in New Mexico today, is listed as \"at risk\", with about 120,000 speakers worldwide. If the Endangered Languages Project works, it may not only help protect Navajo, but also help protect hundreds of other languages. And while these languages may never become the language of international business, making sure that they don't disappear is important -- to protect out cultural heritage and to provide us with valuable information that can help us to better understand ourselves.

        "question": "Do Americans have morals  ? That's a good question. Many people insist that ideas about right and wrong are merely personal opinions. Some voices, though, are calling Americans back to traditional moral values. William J. Bennett, former U.S. Secretary of Education, edited the Book of Virtues in 1993 to do just that. Bennett suggests that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett ' s book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values. But what are they?     One of the most basic moral values for Americans is honesty. The well-known legend about George Washington and the cherry tree tells this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favorite cherry tree while trying out his new axe. When his father asked him about it, George said honestly, \"I can not tell a lie. I did it with my axe.\" Instead of punishment, George received his father's praise for telling the truth.  Sometimes American honesty-being open and direct-can offend people.  But Americans still believe that \"honesty is the best policy.\"      Another virtue Americans respect is perseverance. Remember Aesop's fable( )about the rabbit and the turtle that had a race? The rabbit thought he could win easily, so he took a nap. But the turtle finally won because he didn't give up.      Sympathy may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \"The Good Samaritan\" from the Bible describes a man who showed sympathy. On his way to a certain city, a Samaritan man found a poor traveler lying on the road. The traveler had been beaten and robbed. The kind Samaritan, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need.      In no way can these brief descriptions cover all the moral values honored by Americans. Responsibility, loyalty, courage, gratitude and many others could be discussed. In fact, Bennett's bestseller-over 800 pages-highlights just 10 virtues. Even Bennett admits that he has only covered the surface. But no matter how long or short the list is, moral values are invaluable, they are the foundation of American culture-and any culture. At least how many kinds of moral virtues does the writer list in this passage?",

        "question": "Over 500 dogs being delivered to a butcher house were saved by a Chinese animal protection organization. The incident then resulted in a debate among Chinese netizens about the necessity of pouring so much money and efforts into saving dogs. On Friday, a truck loaded with over 500 dogs was stopped by volunteers from animal protection organization on Beijing section of Jingha expressway. Beijing Times reported these dogs were being delivered to slaughter houses in the city of Changchun, northeast one in Jilin Province and would be eventually served on dinner tables. After negotiations     with the truck driver and a philanthropic     founda tion, Shangshan Foundation purchased these dogs with much money. Dogs were then delivered to the headquarter of China Small Animal Protection Association (CSAPA) , being taken care of and waiting for adoption. After the dog saving mission was reported, Chinese net users debate over whether saving dogs worth so much efforts and money while there are still many poor and needy people in China lacking assistance. Some net users argue the dog saving mission is placing too much attention to animals while lots of needy people are still left unattended. A microblogger \"Xiaowulaitajie\" said on China's twitter-like website, weibo. com, \"Dogs are saved, adopted and they attracted media attention. We'd better spend such money and take such efforts in helping the needy people. \" Another microblogger, Liluping, said \"We poured such huge sum of money into saving dogs. I would rather the money be spent on disaster relief. \" Some applaud volunteers' actions and show eagerness of offering their helping hands to those saved dogs. Still many disapprove those \"saving dogs\" critics. They argue that such act nevertheless _ social progress. A microblogger named \"broken bridge\" said, saving dogs does not go against taking care of people. Such enthusiasm in public affairs will help raise social awareness in helping the needy. I think people and animals are created equal. Attention should be paid to people as well as animals. What does the passage mainly talk about?",

        "question": "Many people like the feeling of the gentle wind in spring . Many like to see the falling leaves dancing in the wind in autumn. But sometimes, when the wind becomes a storm, it can be very destructive. A series of such storms struck the US last month and caused very serious damage and human pain. Every year, major storms cause many problems around the world. There is nothing people can do to stop these powerful forces of nature. But new techniques are helping scientists to predict how, when, and where big storms will happen. The more exact scientists' warnings are, the better people can prepare for the storms. Predictions are improving. \"We've gotten better over the years, especially the last few years,\" says Phil Klotzback, a scientist at an American university. How is a storm formed? Even if scientists know where a storm will happen, winds can suddenly change, carrying the storm to a new direction. \"For a hurricane to happen, conditions have to be just right,\" Klotzback says. First, the ocean water needs to be warm enough so that it evaporates and rises into the air. As it rises, the vapor cools and turns back into liquid. This process gives off heat. This produces energy like an engine that causes winds to increase. It drives the formation of a hurricane. If wind speeds reach 40 miles per hour, the system is called a \"tropical storm\", and it gets a name. At 75 miles per hour, it becomes a hurricane. Hurricanes that hit the US start when a thunderstorm forms off the coast of Africa. Storms also develop over tropical waters in other parts of the world. On average, 60 or 70 storms form off Africa every year. About 10 of them get names. There are usually about six hurricanes. Two tend to be very big, with winds of 115 miles per hour or higher. The hurricane season lasts from June to November. Ninety percent of all hurricanes hit in August, September, and October. Which of the following statements is NOT true?",

In the end, I became so angry that I ran to my father with tears in my eyes.    He listened to me quietly, then he asked. \"Are the things she says true or not? Janet, didn't you ever wonder what you're really like? Well, you now have that girl's opinion. Go and make a list of everything she said and mark the points that are true. Pay no attention to the other things she said.\" I did as he told me. To my great surprise, I discovered that about half the things were true. Some of them I couldn't change (like being very thin), but a good number I could--and suddenly I wanted to change. For the first time I go to fairly clear picture of myself.

        "question": "Just seven years ago, the Jarvik-7 artificial heart was being cheered as the model of human creativeness. The sight of Barney Clark----alive and conscious after trading his diseased heart for a metal-and-plastic pump----convinced the press, the public and many doctors that the future had arrived. It hadn't. After monitoring production of the Jarvik-7, and reviewing its effects on the 150 or so patients (most of whom got the device as a temporary measure) the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that the machine was doing more to endanger lives than to save them. Last week the agency cancelled its earlier approval, effectively banning   the device. The recall may hurt Symbion Inc., maker of the Jarvik-7, but it won't end the request for an artificial heart. One problem with the banned mode is that the tubes connecting it to an external power source created a passage for infection. Inventors are now working on new devices that would be fully placed, along with a tiny power pack, in the patient's chest. The first sample products aren't expected for another 10 or 20 years. But some people are already worrying that they'll work---and that America's overextended health-care programs will lose a precious $2.5 billion to $5 billion a year providing  _ for a  ly few dying patients.

        "question": "I used to be afraid of butterflies!  It is true!  Once, my mom took me to Seattle.  There, we went to a special place.  We went to the zoo!  I saw lots of animals at the zoo.  I saw bears.  I saw tigers.  I saw apes.  I saw monkeys.  I saw snakes.  I loved seeing all these animals.  They made me happy.  We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn't even scare me.  In fact, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar water to feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but I was scared.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said butterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the room.  Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door! The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I was sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there!  I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.  Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not be afraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for my brother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on me and I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies! What did mom get the child to learn about butterflies?",

They laughed and laughed. They laughed so much, in fact, that I was afraid the headmaster would be in and see all this. I asked the class to stop, but the more I talked, the more they laughed. I decided to pay no attention to them and continued to write on the blackboard. When I did this, they laughed even more. Finally, the teacher who was in the next room came in to see what all the laughter was about. When he came in, he started laughing, too! \"Good heavens,\" I said. \"Will someone please tell me what is so funny?\" \"Oh, God,\" said the teacher. \"You have a brown sock stuck to the back of your skirt!\" So that's how I found my husband's missing sock. \"Oh, well,\" I said to the class,\" Let's just say you have had an unforgettable lesson on static electricity .\" What happened when the writer turned around to write on the blackboard?",

        "question": "The concept of culture has been defined many times, and although no definition has achieved universal acceptance, most of the definitions include three central ideas: that culture is passed on from generation to generation, that a culture represents a ready-made principle for living and for making day-to-day decisions, and, finally, that the components of a culture are accepted by those in the culture as good, and true, and not to be questioned. The eminent anthropologist George Murdock has listed seventy-three items that characterize every known culture, past and present. The list begins with Age-grading and Athletic sports, runs to Weaning and Weather Control, and includes on the way such items as Calendar, Fire making, Property Rights, and Tool making. I would submit that even the most extreme advocate of a culture of poverty viewpoint would readily acknowledge that, with respect to almost all of these items, every American, beyond the first generation immigrant, regardless of race or class, is a member of a common culture. We all share pretty much the same sports. Maybe poor kids don't know how to play polo, and rich kids don't spend time with stickball, but we all know baseball, football, and basketball. Despite some misguided efforts to raise minor dialects to the status of separate  tongues, we all, in fact, share the same language. There may be differences in diction and usage, but it would be ridiculous to say that all Americans don't speak English. We have the calendar, the law, and large numbers of other cultural items in common. It may well be true that on a few of the seventy-three items there are minor variations between classes, but these kinds of things are really slight variations on a common theme. There are other items that show variability, not in relation to class, but in relation to religion and ethnic background -- funeral customs and cooking, for example. But if there is one place in America where the melting pot is a reality, it is on the kitchen stove; in the course of one month, half the readers of this sentence have probably eaten pizza, hot pastrami, and chow mein. Specific differences that might be identified as signs of separate cultural identity are relatively insignificant within the general unity of American life; they are cultural commas and semicolons in the paragraphs and pages of American life. It can be inferred that   _   will most probably be included in the seventy-three items.",

The author was Agatha Christie, a gentle married lady and one of the most successful writers of detective stories in the world. ks5u In June 1977 , a baby girl became seriously ill in Qatar   , near Sandi Arabia  . Doctors were unable to find out the cause of her illness, so she was flown to London and sent to Hammersmith Hospital. A team of doctors hurried to examine the baby only to discover that they, too, were puzzled by the very unusual signs of illness. While they were having a discussion about the baby's illness, a nurse asked to speak to them.  \"Excuse me,\" said Nurse Marsha Maitland, \"but I think the baby is suffering from thallium poisoning  .\" \"What makes you think that?\" Dr. Brown asked. \"Thallium poisoning is very rare.\" \"A few days ago, I was reading a novel called 'A Pale Horse' by Agatha Christie,\" Nurse Maitland explained. \"In the book, somebody uses thallium poison, and all the signs are exactly the same as the baby' s . \" \"You are very careful and you may be right,\" another doctor said. \"we'll carry out some tests and find out whether it' s thallium  or not.\" Tests showed that the baby had indeed been poisoned by thallium. Once they knew the cause of the illness, the doctors were able to give the baby the correct treatment. She soon recovered and was sent back to Qatar. Later on it was proved that the poison might have come from an insecticide  used in Qatar. Nurse Maitland spoke to the doctors",

        "question": "When I was an education official in Palo Alto, California, Polly Tyner, the president of our school board, wrote a letter that was printed in the Palo Alto Times. Polly's son, Jim, had great difficulty in school. He was classified as the educationally disabled and required a great deal of patience on the part of his parents and teachers. But Jim was a happy kid with a great smile that lit up the room. His parents acknowledged his academic difficulties, but always tried to help him see his strengths so that he could walk with pride. Shortly after Jim finished high school, he was killed in a motorcycle accident. After his death, his mother submitted this letter to the newspaper: Today we buried our 20-year-old son. He was killed instantly in a motorcycle accident on Friday night. How I wish I had known when I talked to him last that it would be the last time. If I had only known I would have said, \"Jim, I love you and I'm very proud of you.\" I would have taken the time to count the many blessings he brought to the lives of the many who loved him. I would have taken the time to appreciate his beautiful smile, the sound of his laughter, his genuine love of people. When you put all the good qualities on the scale and try to balance all the _ phenomena such as the radio which was always too loud, the haircut that wasn't to our liking, the dirty socks under the bed, etc., your angry feelings won't amount to much. I won't get another chance to tell my son all that I would have wanted him to hear, but, other parents, you do have a chance. Tell your young people what you would want them to hear if you knew it would be your last conversation. The last time I talked to Jim was the day he died. He called me to say, \"Hi, Mom! I just called to say I love you. Got to go to work. Bye.\" He gave me something to treasure forever. If there is any purpose at all for Jim's death, maybe it is to make others appreciate more of life and to have people, especially family members, take the time to let each other know just how much we care. You may never have another chance. Which of the following can be the best title of the passage?",

Traveler was a 75-yearold woman who had white hair and drove a vintage, cream-colored Ford Thunderbird. When Traveler drove into Owner's gas station, Owner thought Traveler must be the robber wanted by the police. After checking the oil at Traveler's request, Owner falsely informed Traveler that she had a broken fan belt, that her car could not be driven without a new belt, that it would take him about an hour to replace it, and that she should stay in his office for consultation about the repair. Traveler was greatly annoyed that her journey was delayed, but she stayed in Owner's office while she waited for her car.

        "question": "My children are perfect. All four of them. Perfect and beautiful and clever. I bet yours are, too. Except, of course, they are not. In reality, my children and yours are likely to be reasonably average in terms of looks, behavior, intelligence and charm. That's why it is called average. Your belief in your child being special is more probably a biological thing than a fact. A loved one, particularly a loved child, is edited as we observe them. Other people's children are spoiled; ours are spirited. Theirs are naughty; ours are confident. This is all natural and even touching when not taken too far. However, it is one thing feeding this idea to ourselves but feeding it to our children may be a little less desirable. We have the idea that -- unlike my parents' generation -- we should build our children's self-respect as high as we can. Therefore, their random scribble   is up there with Picasso, their C-minus is an unfortunate oversight on the part of the teacher, and the fact that no one wants to be friends with them is because they are particularly clever or sensitive. Children see through this kind of thing very quickly and ignore their parents' praises as a matter of course. As they grow up, they sense that the wider world judges them differently. This leads to a - hopefully gentle - cynicism   about anything their parents tell them about their achievements. Perhaps that is OK -- but I'm not sure if it is good for them to have the parental praise so overlooked. If parents were a little _ sometimes, this could have two positive effects -- first, when praise came, it would be more likely to be believed and, second, it would fit in rather more accurately with the picture of reality that the child is forming in their heads. A lot of pressure is put on children who are told they are beautiful, special and perfect. Because then, where is there to go? Only downwards. They become too much aware of their status in your eyes, and a danger must be that they fear failing you. To be over-praised by your parents is the counter side of being criticized all the time. Both can have negative consequences. It is important to give your children the freedom to be flawed   -- to know that it's OK to be imperfect, and that, in fact, we often love people for their flaws -- perfect people (whom we can only imagine, as they do not exist) are easy to respect, but hard to love. Now I am nearly 60, my main insight is that I am much less special than I once believed. This knowledge has actually been helpful in leading a more well-balanced life. I certainly wouldn't like to go back to attitudes that my parents, particularly my father, held, that to praise the child was to \"spoil them\" or make them bigheaded. However, the history of families is like the history of everything else -- the story of overreactions. We praise our children to the skies, partly because we think it makes them feel good, but also because it makes us feel good. And perhaps it is more the latter than the former. Too much love can be as big a burden as a shortage of it. My advice is to limit your praise. Then every piece of praise will count, rather than being just ignored.

        "question": "British and American scientists are raising genetically modified  pigs in the hope of providing organs for transplant  to humans, the project leader wrote in a newspaper Sunday.  Scientists in London and California have begun conducting the genetic experiments to find a solution to record-long waiting lists for organ transplants, Robert Winston said in an opinion piece written for Britain's Sunday Times.  In Britain alone, around 8,000 patients are waiting for a transplant.  \"People needing a new heart or liver are waiting for someone else to die -usually a violent death in a traffic accident,\" Winston wrote in the newspaper. He said his team was \"trying to modify pigs so their organs might save the lives of humans.\"  The scientists are introducing human genes into the animals to reduce the chances of the organs being rejected by patients, as has been common in previous attempts to use animal tissues, said Winston, who heads the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology at London's Hammersmith Hospital.  Working with Dr. Carol Redhead of the California Institute of Technology, Winston's team has injected human genes directly into male piglets , adding them to the animal's sperm .  He said that pigs involved in experiments had successfully produced transgenic sperm, but acknowledged that British and European laws had prevented the team from using the pigs to mate.  The Sunday Times newspaper reported that the experiments would be moved to the United States following difficulties with funding and regulations in Britain. It said the pigs would be bred in Missouri.  \"Our U.S. friends will benefit from our technology and the income we might have produced for Britain will be lost,\" Winston wrote.  Some scientists have previously blamed the idea of using animal organs for human transplant, saying the technique risks spreading animal viruses to humans.

They drive a $1 million, fuel-cell-powered car. It may be the world's most expensive car and one of the most environmentally friendly cars. The FCX is the first fuel-cell-powered car to be used by a family anywhere in the world. The FCX uses hydrogen and oxygen for fuel. Car makers have been working to develop vehicles that are better for the environment. They are developing cars that use fuel other than gasoline. And then what is fuel cell technology? Fuel cell technology works by changing the chemicals hydrogen and oxygen into water. This process produces electricity, and water vapor which comes out of the exhaust pipe. Most cars release dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Many scientists say these gases are major contributors to global warming. \"The FCX is driven just like any other vehicle on the road, but without the gases which pollute the environment,\" scientists say. Fuel cell technology has been around since the 1800s, but scientists have yet been to perfect it. They say it may take years before the technology is ready for widespread use.

        "question": "We were moving to a new state after my husband had been out of work for many months and we had no money. In fact, we had to borrow money to reach our destination town. Anyway, it was my husband, two boys aged four and two, and myself, seven months pregnant  , in an old Volvo station wagon. We had been driving for two days in the middle of winter (that car's heater didn't work), and we had taken a route that was very _ . There was nothing around for miles-no cars, buildings or signs of civilization. Suddenly, our car started losing power and the gauges  went all out of order. We saw a light in the distance and managed to roll to a stop in front of this property that looked like a small simple house. Our cell phones had not gotten reception for many miles, and it was freezing outside, so I didn't know if we were going to make it out of this situation alive. My husband got out of the car to see if there was something he could do to get us rolling again, but it was not looking good. A short while later, a man came out of the house and spoke with my husband a bit before inviting us all into his home. He and his wife took us in, fed us, and made us feel at home as we struggled to find some way to get to our destination, which was still a few hours' drive away. We were able to call a friend and get a ride, leaving our broken car behind, but not before the couple gave us food and water for our journey.

Without help the person whose heart stops beating properly and who begins to feel  has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness. However, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very powerfully. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and last long, as when producing  from deep inside the chest. A breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without stopping until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again. Deep breaths get oxygen into the  and coughing movements squeeze  the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm . In this way, heart attack victims can get to a phone and, between breaths, call for help. Now, do you understand the whole matter? Tell as many other people as possible about this.

        "question": "Michael froze as he heard the voice on the radio saying that a man had been murdered by a bullet that had come from the sky. Thinking that the shot they had fired possibly was the shot that killed Mr. Ward, he immediately drove off. For the next two months, Michael and Joe hid the secret that the bullet had actually shot Mr. Ward. During this time, Jenna Ward started to realize life without her father. While Jenna mourned the death of her father, a strange boy started to appear at the front steps of the church. After many nights of watching this boy, she finally recognized that it was Michael who was sitting on the steps every night. After months of finding out where the shot came, the police arrived at Michael's house. His dad mentioned the gun that Michael had received from his grandpa at his birthday party. Michael told the police that Joe had borrowed the gun. Upon this, Joe said that the gun had been stolen out of his car along with his CD player. After the police were gone, Michael met Joe and told Joe the gun was under the wood pile in his backyard. One day , Michael came home to find the police searching his backyard with metal detectors .When the Sergeant went into the woods behind the house , he came out with a bullet that Joe and he had shot off on his birthday .The bullet matched the one that they had recovered from Mr Ward , but without the gun , the police could not place Michael as the killer.

        "question": "An 11-year-old boy who has been compared to Spanish Impressionist  , the great Pablo Picasso, is holding his first exhibition at Llangollen's Gardening Show this weekend. Hamad al-Humaidhan, who was born in Kuwait but now lives in Bath, Britain, had no previous knowledge of art history when he first picked up a brush. But he began to paint his favourite football player, Cristiano Ronaldo, using Picasso's trademarks   --bright colours and impressionistic forms. His father said, \"I've got lots of books about Picasso and I showed them to Hamad but he didn't know anything about Picasso --it's just naturally the way he sees it and he just loves to paint.\" His first painting of Ronaldo, done when he was just nine, was sold at auction   in Bath for PS650, which drew the attention of local art businessman Steve Turner. \"A colleague sent me some pictures of Hamad's work and I just couldn't believe the size of it and how the colours blended   together,\" he said. \"He had talent and I thought Picasso had been reborn.\"\"I've shown his work to private art collectors. They liked them very much and everyone was eager to buy, so the first six paintings have been  _ . I bought two of them myself. The next set of his works will go on show for the first time at Llangollen, which will be the first opportunity for the public to see his amazing talent.\" Hamad enjoys maths at school but ranks painting higher. \"I think I prefer painting! It makes me relaxed and when I feel tired I just pick up a paint brush,\" he said. \"I just close my eyes and see how it's going to look and then I just paint it --I paint every day. I just love the colours and I want people to enjoy my paintings.\" Now Hamad is nervously waiting for the opening of his exhibition. What can we learn from the text?",

        "question": "As the price of a college degree continues to rise, there's growing evidence that the monetary  payoff isn't quite as big as often advertised. The best estimate now is that a college degree is worth about $300,000 in today's dollars--nowhere near the million figure that is often quoted. \"That million number has driven me crazy!\" says Sandy Baum, a Skidmore economist who studied the value of a college degree for the College Board last year. Baum's research showed that college graduates earn, on average, about $20,000 a year more than those who finished their educations at high school. Add that up over a 40-year working life and the total differential is about $800,000, she figures. But since much of that bonus is earned many years from now, taking away the impact of inflation means that$800,000 in future dollars is worth only about $450,000 in today's dollars. Then, if you remove the cost of a college degree--about ,$30,000 in tuition and books for students who get no aid and attend public in-state universities--and the money a student could have earned at a job instead of attending school, the real net value in today's dollars is somewhere in the $300,000 range, a number confirmed by other studies. But, especially these days, that still makes a college degree one of the most _ investments a person can make, Baum notes. Better yet, college graduates can go on to earn advanced degrees, which return even bigger payoffs. The average holder of a bachelor's degree earns about$51,000 a year, Baum calculates. But those who've gone on to earn MBAs, law degrees, or other professional degrees earn about $100,000 a year. In addition, Baum found that there are plenty of other rewards for a degree. The quality of the jobs college graduates get is far better, for example. College graduates are more likely to get jobs with health insurance. And it is easier for them to find and hold jobs. The unemployment rate for college graduates was just 2.2 percent last year, half the unemployment level of those with only high school diplomas. There are lots of other nonmonetary benefits as well. College graduates are healthier, contribute more to their communities, and raise kids who are better prepared academically, studies show. Other researchers have found that the payoff of a degree is especially lucrative for students from low-income families, since the education and degrees give them a chance to break out of low-paying careers. Which of the following statements can be learned from the text ?",

These movies encourage watchers to get up and dance along to kid-friendly music. Saturday Get the whole family out of the house together and over to a park. Bring lots of sports equipment, pack a healthy picnic and have a family competitive sports day. Kids and adults get into groups and play against each other in tennis, basketball or soccer. After everyone has played hard for a couple of hours, stop for a picnic and then if your family isn't too tired, go back and play some more.

        "question": "The greatest recent changes have ,been in the lives of women ,During the twentieth century there was an unusual shortening of the time of a woman's life spent in caring for children. A woman marrying at the end of the 19th century would probably have been in her middle twenties ,and would be likely to have seven or eight children, of whom four or five lived till they were five years old ,By the time the youngest was fifteen ,the mother would have been id her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years ,during which custom ,chance and health made it unusual for her to get paid work, Today women marry younger and have fewer children Usually a woman 's youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty-five and is likely to take paid work until retirement at sixty Even while she has the care of children ,her work is lightened by household appliances  and convenience foods. This important change in women's way of life has only recently begun to have its full effect on women' s economic position Even a few years ago most girls left school at the first opportunity and most of them took a full-time job However ,when they married ,they usually left work at once and never returned to it ,Today the school-leaving age is sixteen ,many girls stay at school after that age ,and though women tend to marry younger ,more married women stay at work at leas until shortly before their first child is born Very many more after wads ,return to full or part-time work Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage ,with both husband and wife accepting a greater share of the duties and satisfaction of family life, and with both husband and wife sharing more e-qually in providing the money and running the home ,according to the abilities and inter-est of each them.

        "question": "Like all big cities, Paris has a traffic problem: lots of cars, lots of traffic jams  and lots of pollution from exhaust fumes . So the city began a scheme  to improve the situation. Under the Velib scheme('Velib' comes from velo liberte, or 'bicycle freedom') , people can take a bicycle, use it for as long as they want, and then leave it at the same or another bicycle station. The first half-hour on the bike is free, but if you don't return it after 30 minutes, you have to pay. But it's only [?]1 a day or [?]29 a year! The bicycles are heavy (25 kg), and they are all grey and have baskets. There are about 20,000 of them in the city, and around 1,450 bicycle stations. So there are a lot more Velib stations than the 298 subway stations! Paris is not the first city to have a scheme like this. But not everybody thinks it's a great idea. One Parisian said, \"These bicycles are only for short journeys. If people want to travel across the city, they won't use a bicycle -- they'll still use their cars.\" A city spokesman said, \"The bicycle scheme won't solve all our traffic problems, of course. But it might help reduce air pollution. Traffic, together with factory fumes, is a big problem. There aren't any simple answers to traffic problems and pollution in cities. But unless we do something now, there will be more traffic jams and temperatures will continue to rise, so the problems in our environment will get worse. The bikes might help people to lead a healthier life, too.\" Why do some people disagree with the Velib scheme?",

        "question": "New research finds a link between poverty and poor decision making. The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship.      Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey.  Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India.       The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs.      The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost $ 150.  In the second,  $ 1,500.      \"And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. \"       Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to $ 1,500.      \"Now the poor performed significantly worse. \" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night.      The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor. The Indian sugar cane farmers earn most of their money once a year, when the harvest comes in. But the money often does not last through the year.     \"So they find themselves basically rich after the harvest when the income comes in and poor just before the harvest.      The researchers gave them tests similar to the ones taken by the people in New Jersey. They tested the Indian farmers before the harvest and after.      And the results were much the same as with the mall shoppers.      \"They performed much more slowly and with many more mistakes when they were poorer than when they were richer. \"      Mr. Shafir says the results support 50 years of research that shows all humans have limited mental power to deal with things in life.      \"And so the insight here is that, having not enough of something in a way makes it harder to make good decisions for everything else. \" What do the two experiments have in common?

        "question": "Fifty has never looked better. It's been 50 years since the first James Bond film, Dr. No, premiered   in cinemas. As first embodied by Scottish actor Sean Connery, Agent 007 was a fearless, cool-as-ice spy who excelled at sleuthing  , fighting and saving the world. Since then, more than 20 films featuring the iconic spy have been released-making it one of the longest-running franchises   in the history of cinema. On Nov 9, the 23rd Bond movie, Skyfall, celebrated the legend's 50th birthday. Over the years, audiences have changed. It doesn't matter. Six different actors have acted 007 and it doesn't matter. Even shocking technological and cultural changes can't bend Bond. Why? Is it the action, the sexy women, the cars, the gadgets and the exotic locations? Yes, but the most important reason is still the man himself. Bond can challenge his boss and shoot a bad guy in mere minutes. He is an expert in literature, languages, art and fine wines. He has a sharp tongue besides his wits.  In the first film Dr. No, as Connery lit a cigarette, we heard James Bond's voice and saw his cafe for the first time. The simple scene and short phrase have defined the character for half a century. \"Next to the Beatles and Stones, James Bond was the greatest British import of the 1960s,\" David Kamp, a US contributing editor for Vanity Fair, wrote in a recent article about the birth of Bond and its influence on the US. The Bond phenomenon has clearly affected movie culture, pop culture and spy culture. But perhaps the most amazing thing is that 007 has survived in the age of feminism . \"Talking of objectifying women, Bond is essential Huge Henfner (founder of Playboy magazine) with a gun,\" movie critic Xan Brooks told The Guardian. \"But women liked Bond, too. He couldn't have run for 50 years with male fans alone.\" We love Bond for many reasons--after all 50 years, Bond is still breathtaking. thrilling ride into the very heart of an icon like no other.

Students carry their own things, which includes sleeping bags, warm clothing, food and water, and other useful tools. And what do the students do all day? Well, as soon as the sun comes up, they eat breakfast and start climbing up the mountain trail to the next campground, which is five to ten miles away. As the students take notes, the guide points out different plants and animals alongside the trail. The climb is usually over by early afternoon, so the group spends the rest of the day resting or swimming in a mountain lake. Before dinner each night, they all come together and discuss the day's activities. At the end of the course, the students write reports using the information they have collected.

        "question": "As you grow older, you'll be faced with some challenging decisions--like whether to cut class or try cigarettes. Making decisions on your own is hard enough, but when other people get involved and try to pressure you one way or another it can be even harder. People who are your age, like your classmates, are called peers. When they try to influence how you act, to get you to do something, it's called peer pressure. Peers can have a positive influence on each other. Maybe another student in your science class taught you an easy way to remember the planets in the solar system. Maybe you got others excited about your new favorite book, and now everyone's reading it. These are examples of how peers positively influence each other. Sometimes peers influence each other in negative ways. For example, a few kids in school might try to get you to cut class with them; your soccer friend might try to convince you to be mean to another player and never pass him the ball. It is tough to be the only one who says \"no\" to peer pressure, but you can do it. Paying attention to your own feelings and beliefs about what is right and wrong can help you know the right thing to do. You've probably had a parent or teacher advising you to \"choose your friends wisely.\" Peer pressure is a big reason why they say this. If you choose friends who don't cut class, smoke cigarettes, or lie to their parents, then you probably won't do these things either, even if other kids do. If you continue to face peer pressure and you're finding it difficult to handle, talk to someone you trust. Don't feel guilty if you've made a mistake or two. What is the topic of the passage?",

Many, many people use it, not only in England and the USA, but also in other parts of the world. About 200,000,000 people speak it as their own language. It is difficult to say how many people are learning it as a foreign language. Many millions of people are trying to do so. Is it easy or difficult to learn English? Different people may have different answers. Have you ever noticed ads  of this kind in the newspapers or magazines? \"Learn English in six weeks, or give your money back...\" \"Easy and funny...\" \"Our records and tapes help you master English in a month\". Of course, it never happened quite like that. The only language that seems easy to learn is the mother tongue. We should remember that we all learned our own language well when we were children. If we could learn English in the same way, it would not seem so difficult. Think of what a small child does. He listens to what people say. He tries what he hears. So it is hard to say that learning English is easy. We must do a lot of practice. And practice needs great efforts and takes much time.

Martin noticed Pablo was smiling and looked very happy. He could also see several large fish in the boat.

        "question": "American farmers are raising five percent more goats for meat these days. Goat meat is high in protein and lower in unhealthy fat than many other meats.Even so,the industry is small compared to chicken,beef and pork. But immigration has brought more of a taste for goat to America from all over the world. Experts from the University of Illinois offer some questions for people to consider if they are thinking about raising goats. First of all,do you understand that there always has to be someone to care for the goats? *How much land do you have available? And how good is it? Poor ground may support two to four goats on half a hectare.Better grassland can support six to eight. If goats and cattle share the land,two goats can be added for each cow. The goats will eat weeds and other plants that cattle do not like. *Do you have buildings for the number of female goats you plan to keep during winter? An open,cold,dry barn is better than a closed,warm barn where the air is wet. *Do you have the equipment to clean barns  and to harvest hay  to feed your goats? Or will you get someone else to do it,or buy the hay? The experts say a profitable business in goat meat may take three to five years to establish.And, of course, there are no guarantees . On which section of a newspaper will this passage appear?",

        "question": "Noah Webster, born on October 16, 1758 , is known for The American Dictionary of the English Language. He has been called the \" Father of American Scholarship and Education. \" His \" Blue-Backed Speller\" books were used to teach spelling and reading to five generations of American children. But how much .do you know about him beyond that? At the age of 16, Noah Webster began attending ,Yale College. Unfortunately, he spent his four years at Yale during the American Revolutionary War, and, because of food shortages, many of his college classes were held in Glastonbury, Connecticut. Later, he served in the army. Having graduated from Yale in 1778, Webster wanted to continue his education in order to earn his law degree. He had to teach school in order to pay for his education. He set up many small schools that didn't survive, but he was a good teacher because instead of forcing his students to learn, like most teachers did, he rewarded them. He earned his law degree in 1781, but did not practice law until 1789. Once he started he found the law was not to his liking. Webster did not have much money. In 1793 , Alexander Hamilton lent him $ 1500 to move to New York City to edit a newspaper. In December, he founded New York ' s first daily newspaper, American Minerva, and edited it for four years. For decades, he published . textbooks, political essays, a report on some diseases, and newspaper articles for his party, He wrote so much that a modern list of his published works required 655 pages .Noah Webster died on May 28, 1843 and was buried in the Grove Street Cemetery. What did Noah want to be after graduation from Yale?",

        "question": "If your parents were to surprise you with a present on your birthday, which one would you prefer, a trip to the amusement park or a new pair of shoes? According to Science Daily, about onethird of the people are likely to prefer shoes to a fun trip. These people are called \"materialists\", namely, those who value material goods more than experiences. But which of the two choices makes people happier? Back in 2009, Ryan Howell, a professor at San Francisco State University, found that in the long run, experiences make people happier than possessions. This is because the joy of receiving a new object fades over time as you get used to seeing it every day. Experiences, on the other hand, can continue to bring you joy in the future through happy memories. But materialists should at least be happy when they first buy something, shouldn't they? To figure it out, Howell did another study. He classified a group of adults according to their personality types, ranging from less materialistic to more materialistic. Each person was asked different questions to see how they felt about spending money on material goods versus spending money on experiences. As expected, the more materialistic participants got less happiness from purchases than the less materialistic, because such purchases didn't fit with their personalities and values. But to Howell's surprise, he found that materialists weren't any happier even if they spent money on material items. This is because materialists worry that others may criticize or look down on their choices. \"There are certain value systems that are rejected by society,\" said Howell. \"When we find out someone is materialistic, we think less of them, and that drives their happiness down.\" Another reason is that materialistic people always focus on what they don't have instead of what they have now. This makes them feel less satisfied and grateful. If you happen to be a materialistic person, there's something you can try. \"If materialists make more accurate purchases, rather than trying to impress others, they will be happier,\" Howell said. You should also remember what an ancient Greek philosopher once said, \"Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.\" What did Ryan Howell want to find out by doing another study?",

The eye-recognition  program is already being tested in shops and banks in the USA, Britain and France. Soon, this technology  will change all other ways of finding out who people are. However, scientists are working on other systems. Machines will soon be able to know you from the shape of your face or hands or even your smell! We already have machines that can tell who you are from your voice or the mark made by your fingers. Eye-recognition is better than other kinds because your eyes don't change as you get older, or get dirty like hands or fingers. And even twins have different eyes, so the program can be up to 94% correct, depending on  how good the technology is. Some programs may only be right 51% of the time.

        "question": "A few years ago, I worked at a church . Since my son was home schooling, he went with me to the church every day. Most mornings, we'd stop at a local store, and get a chocolate drink for him and a cup of coffee for me. The clerk  at the store made our lives more enjoyable each day, and so we returned again and again. She had found her own way of enjoying life and her job. I'm not even sure if she realized that her warmth and brightness put a smile upon the face of each customer . When a customer brought cakes to the counter, any other clerk could have asked: \"Would you like some milk with those cakes?\" Instead, she asked: \"Would you like a lottery ticket  with those cakes?\" She might have asked me if I wanted sugar with my coffee. But instead, she asked: \"Would you like some batteries  with that coffee?\" Yes, life is what you make of it. This clerk's method of dealing with what some think is a boring job, and with the customers she met daily, made the hours in her day more enjoyable. In doing that, she also refreshed the lives of others and made them laugh. Sometimes, if my day at the church had been very tiring, we'd stop at that store before going home. We'd giggle   as we left the store, the clerk's words echoing   behind us. \"Would you like some shampoo   with that orange juice?\" What was the clerk like?",

        "question": "Look closely at ,your hands-are they clean? It doesn't matter how many times you was  your hands. They're still crowded with microbes, which are also called \"germs\" or \"bacteria\". Microbes are everywhere. But don't worry-most microbes don't harm you. and many actually help you stay alive. Now,  scientists say the microbes that live on our hands could be used in a surprising way: fighting crime. When police visit the scene of a crime, they often look for fingerprints to try to identifythe criminal.  But according to a recent study, investigators could even use microbes to help break a criminal case. Every person has his or her own set of microbes that live on their hands, according to scientists at,the University of:Colorado. That means the mix of different kinds of microbes on everybody's hand is unique-much like one's fingerprint. The scientists wanted to know whether this microbe mix could be used as a new kind of fingerprint-especially in a crime scene where fingerprints might be hard to find.  And policemen use forensics such as studying fingerprints to identify the criminal. \"Microbe fingerprints are harder to hide,\" said Noah Fierer, one of the scientists. \"You can't sterilize(......) a surface just by wiping it off. \" His team compared the bacteria on the hands of 273 people with the bacteria found on each person's computer keyboard. For the study, the keyboards had been used only by the people who were being tested. The study showed that the mix of microbes from each per- son's hands matched the mix of microbes on that person's keyboard. The scientists were easily able to tell the 273 people apart-just by looking at their keyboards. But there are a lot more than 273 criminals. Other scientists wonder whetherthe microbe fingerprint can really be that useful. Fierer agrees that scientists have a lot more work to do before the microbe fingerprint will be a useful tool.

        "question": "Can you remember a morning when you've woken up to the ring of your alarm clock and wished you could stay in bed? You haven't slept well, your hair is a mess. Worse, you can't stop yawning. Yawning is universal to humans and many animals. Cats, dogs and fish yawn just like humans do! Yawning is an involuntary(,) action during which you open your mouth and breathe deeply. The average duration of a yawn is about 6 seconds. The purpose and cause of yawning are still a mystery. Scientists are not sure what causes a yawn. People yawn when they are tired or bored, but they also yawn when they aren't. There are many ideas explaining why we yawn. One idea is that yawning is a way for the body to become more alert by taking in more oxygen. A yawn increases the heart rate, forces carbon dioxide out of the lungs and blood stream, and brings oxygen to the brain. But one study showed that volunteers given a lot of oxygen did not yawn any less than before, while those given a lot of carbon dioxide did not yawn more. Another idea is that early humans used yawning as a form of communication. If one decided it was time to sleep, they would tell the others by yawning and they would do it in return to show they agreed. A third explanation comes from psychology professor Gordon Gallup of University at Albany in New York. He said that as people yawn, they cool off their brains. \"Brains are like computers.\" he said. \"They only operate efficiently and effectively when they're cool. Many things connected to yawning, like being tired, make the brain hot, and yawning can reduce the heat.\" Scientists have sent people into space, and created terrible nuclear weapons, but there are lots of seemingly simple things, such as why we yawn, or hiccup , that they can't figure out. Next time you are in class in the morning, let out a big yawn and watch to see how many of your classmates yawn in response! What's the purpose of the description of how bad you may feel when you're woken up in the morning?",

        "question": "In the 1500s, South American fishermen said that the sea became warmer every few years. They gave this special event a Spanish name 'El Nino', meaning 'the baby'. It is called 'the baby' because it arrives around Christmas. El Nino is a huge area of warm water in the middle of cold water in the Pacific Ocean. It happens every two to seven years. It moves around the ocean and becomes bigger and smaller at different times. This warm water affects the weather. It is always raining over El Nino. El Nino contains a lot of energy. Scientists think this energy is formed when wind comes from the northern half of the world. The winds blow across warm sea water in the south. When the strong wind hits the warm water, violent weather happens. Scientists think that El Nino existed for many thousands of years. El Nino affects every person in the world because it affects the entire world's weather. It can bring the rain that farmers need. It can bring storms that destroy homes. It can mean that fishermen cannot catch fish, and it can bring floods. There is nothing we can do about El Nino. It is an event of nature. We can help the world's weather by trying to stop the greenhouse effect and air pollution. The most important job for scientists is to learn how to predict when El Nino is going to bring dangerous weather. Then, people can try to prepare for storms, floods and droughts. New technology like satellite pictures and temperature measuring equipment can help. Still, it is very hard to say when or where El Nino will cause damage. El Nino affects   _  .",

        "question": "\"A Long Walk Home\"-----life as Eli Reed saw it American photographer and photojournalist Eli Reed has been documenting \"life as I saw it\" for more than 40 years. His career retrospective , \"Eli Reed: A Long Walk Home\", is an extraordinary search of beauty while recording hardship. With a heart of love, Reed uses a style that uncovers humanity at every turn. According to Reed, \"A Long Walk Home\" is about what it means to be a human being. It all began with a photo he took of his mother and his memory of her smile. Raised in New Jersey, reed was originally a painter. Primarily self-taught in photography, he became a freelance photographer in 1970. after producing some impressive photos that drew much attention, he joined the famous company Magnum Photos---the first black photographer invited to do so. His photos are remarkable in their lack of judgment of the people or the situations he comes across. In Beirut, Lebanon, a man removes a tree branch from a car in a recently bombed parking lot. An old man wrapped in a sheet plays a drum in front of a sign reading \"God Is the Way\" while National Guardsmen lift their guns during a war in Miami. A young boy upside down with his legs in the air in a Kenyan refugee camp, his determined look faces the camera. In Harlem, New York, a group of laughing children take over an abandoned car, using it as a jungle gym. Where another photographer might have focused on the _ of these situations. Reed's camera smiles. His images show how humans cope, rise above, and carry on. This is what gives \" A Long Walk Home\" its power. Considering the places Reed has been to, there are very few photos of guns or obvious violence. Instead, Reed  focuses on the varied human responses to hardship. We smile along with Reed in a gesture of compassion and solidarity. We recognize our fellow human beings. Why did Eli Reed produce his work \"A Long Walk Home\"?",

        "question": "Celebrities  have become a powerful influence on some people because of their social position and their economic situation. First, some people admire and imitate stars because they allow themselves to be influenced by the media. Television, radio, and magazines invade  the lives of audience with a variety of shows, information, and publications about stars and their lives. For instance, Britney Spears has become the target of paparazzi . In May, Britney appeared at the front page of the most popular magazines revealing that she married her best friend in Vegas, Nevada. Media also invade stars' lives because reporters know they can get high profits from readers who buy and follow their favorite artists' news. Second, some mad audiences imitate their celebrities for their lack of confidence. Some people who are shy and lack personality may find that imitating others will cause a good impression. For example, my cousin Jenny, who lacks a social life because of her introverted  personality, believes that acting and dressing like Jennifer Lopez will make her popular in high school. Finally, several fans of stars imitate them because of peer pressure. Since my niece's girl friends formed an Antonio Banderas' fan club, she had also joined the group. Although she wasn't a huge fan of his, now she collects most of Banderas' possessions. In fact, when I asked Arianna, my niece, why she was part of Banderas' fan club, she replied with a doubtful tone that she did not wish to be rejected by the other teens. In conclusion, it is true that celebrities play spectacular roles in their performances in Hollywood, which entertains many people all over the world; however, modern celebrities influence the audience to the point where their fans admire and try to imitate their lives.

        "question": "People Born in Autumn Live Longer People born in the autumn live longer than those born in the spring and are less likely to fall chronically ill when they are older, according to an Austrian scientist. Using census data for more than one million people in Austria, Denmark and Australia, scientists at the Max Planck Institute in the northern German town of Rostock found the month of birth was related to life expectancy over the age of 50. Seasonal differences in what mothers ate during pregnancy, and infections occurring at different times of the year could both have an impact on the health of a new-born baby and could influence its life expectancy in older age. \"A mother giving birth in spring spends the last phase of her pregnancy in winter, when she will eat less vitamins than in summer,\" said Gabriele Doblhammer, one of a team of scientists who carried out the research. \"When she stops breast-feeding and starts giving her baby normal food, it's in the hot weeks of summer when babies are prone  to infections of the digestive system.\" In Austria, adults born in autumn (October-December) lived about seven months longer than those born in spring (April-June), and in Denmark adults with birthdays in autumn outlived those born in spring by about four months. In the southern hemisphere, the picture was similar. Adults born in the Australian autumn--the European spring--lived about four months longer than those born in the Australian spring. The study focused on people born at the beginning of the 20th century, using death certificates and census data. Although nutrition at all times of the year has improved since then, the seasonal pattern persists, Doblhammer said. But on the other hand, according to a study of more 40,000 people, those born in spring and summer report themselves luckier than those born in autumn or winter. Professor Richard Wise-man who led the research explained that the temperature at the time of birth might influence the development of the brain and seasonal factors make a difference as well.

She died not long after from poisoning. She was the love of her dad's life, and he was so upset that he sold the family farm to buy the Italian made statue, which today marks her grave. At first, it was her father who brought the flowers and laid them in her hands. When he died in 1896, the flowers kept coming. Her flowers are different per season. Why do the flowers keep miraculously appearing? People have tried to find out by having camped by the statue, but not even the groundskeepers have been able to catch the criminal.

        "question": "Below is a housing guide for students going to London. University accommodation  offices Many university accommodation offices have their own list of registered landlords  . Others also provide information on accommodation agencies and other housing organizations. The advantage of using your university accommodation office is that you can get some support if you have a problem. The disadvantage is that they are unlikely to have enough registered landlords to houses all their students. Property papers: Loot and Renting Loot is an important source   of information about private housing for co-renters. The offers are from private landlords, agencies and individuals looking for other co-renters. They also have a website: www.loot.com. The advantage of using Loot is that there are some excellent bargains. The disadvantage is that there is no quality control over the offers. Renting is another useful paper. The offers in this paper are mainly from accommodation agencies. Their website is at www.renting.co.uk. Accommodation agencies The majority of rented accommodation in London is probably advertised through accommodation agencies. The advantage of using accommodation agencies is that: you will have access to a large number of accommodations. A good agent will listen to your requirements and can save you time in looking for the right accommodation. The disadvantage is that they will make a range of charges to potential renters. Noticeboards Around the universities you will find a number of noticeboards where offers of accommodation will be posted. These will either be from landlords or from students. Some universities will also have online noticeboards where students can advertise to other students. Advertisements from students can be an excellent way to find accommodation. However, advertisements from landlords can be problematic. Word of mouth Some of the best housing in London is never advertised but is passed on from one group of students to another by word of mouth. It might be that you can find out about good offers from final year students. However, don't suppose that just because you have found out about housing from a friend it is necessarily going to be better than that found through any other source. Family Faced with the very high rents charged in London, some students and their parents will consider buying as an alternative. In some cases this might be a good choice. What is the advantage of using Loot?",

        "question": "Daniel Olin was 11 years old when his parents moved to Canada. He liked his new school and made friends there, but then things at home started to change. His mum and dad began to argue and the arguments got worse and worse until one day, Daniel's mum left. With his father working long hours, Daniel felt very lonely and very unhappy. He wanted to escape, to run away. And that's what he did. Very early one terribly cold morning when the snow was deep on the ground, he packed a bag with some clothes, some chocolate and a map of Canada and set off to a forest. He ran and ran until he could hardly breathe. His feet were heavy with the snow but he still walked on through deep snow, not even watching where he was going. Then, disaster struck. A rock hidden by the deep snow caught his feet and Daniel fell to the ground. He had broken the bone. He was very cold and was starting to feel tired, but he knew that if he fell asleep in the snow, he would certainly die from the cold. A tree shook ahead. From within the branches , a pair of yellow eyes watched Daniel. The puma had been following him. A puma is a large wild cat with claws that could tear  Daniel into pieces. But instead of moving in for the kill, the puma walked up to Daniel and lay across his chest, arms and legs. Daniel was too frightened to move, but soon the warmth of the animal reached Daniel and he began to feel better. From time to time, the puma pressed his muzzle   against Daniel and rocked his head gently. Clearly, the puma knew that Daniel must not fall asleep. This animal should have been a real danger to Daniel and yet the boy began to feel safe. They remained like that for several hours until Daniel and the puma heard voices. The rescue   team had found them. Where was the puma when Daniel first saw it?",

A ferry is a boat that takes people and cars across the river. Both ends of a ferry look the same. The ferry never has to turn around. It docks at one side of the river. People and cars get on. At the other side, the ferry docks again. The people and cars get off. Other cars and people get on. And then the ferry goes back across the river. In many places, bridges are now taking the place of ferries. In 1964, the longest bridge in the world was built in New York over Now York Bay . It is called the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.

It might sound like science fiction,but professors at the university of Tokyo have taken the first steps toward making that scenario a reality.The team recently introduced a humanoid kitchen robot that can pour tea and other drinks into cups and serve them to guests.When teatime is over,the robot can also wash the dishes and put them away. In California,another interesting kitchen robot has been developed.Called the Readybot,it can pick up objects and either store them in cabinets or put them in the trash.It also carries a separate floor-cleaning robot that can operate by itself.Unlike the Japanese robot,Readybot is not humanoid.Instead,it looks more like a large box with arms and wheels. Readybot was created by engineers and designers who established a club called the Readybot Challenge.They believe that in the future millions of robots will be needed in homes to perform ordinary household tasks.Readybot is just the first step in their plan to create a robot that can tackle jobs not only in kitchens but in other rooms of homes and in offices as well. Clearly there are technological hurdles to overcome before robots can cook a complete dinner,and there are also many safety concerns.Not everyone(especially parents)would be comfortable with the idea of robots in their house,manipulating hot pans and sharp knives.The European Commission recently funded a project to study these concerns.

        "question": "The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league with 32 teams in. How does one choose which team to support? Some people choose the team of their hometown, or where they now live, or the team that their parents or their friends follow.[:ZXXK] A boy student from Oklahoma wrote a letter to each of the owners or presidents of the 32 NFL teams. He would see what answers he got, and then choose his team. Bill was home from school sick. It was the week before Christmas. He was \"kind of bored\" and needed something to do. So he asked his parents if he could write to every professional football team. Bill wrote the 32 letters by hand. \"We weren't quite sure what we could get back. He didn't really have one team that he wanted to hear from,\" his mother said: \"He just wanted to see what kind of reply he' d get.\" A letter to the Carolina Panthers' owner Jerry Richardson was one of those posted. Bill wrote in his letter, \"My family and I love football. They are fans of different teams.But I don't have a team to cheer for yet. I am ready to pick an NFL team to cheer on for lifetime!\" A few weeks later, Bill's mother was pulling into her driveway when a delivery man arrived with a box from the Panthers. When Bill came home, he excitedly opened the box. Inside he found a signed Carolina Panthers helmet as well as a handwritten note from Jerry. The team owner had written to Bill, \"We should be honored if our Carolina Panthers became your team. We would make you proud of your joining us.\" Bill was overjoyed with what he got. He decided that from then on he would support the Panthers. He keeps the letter from Jerry in his bedroom. His mother says, \"It's not the helmet they sent us. It's what they told us.\" That is what mattered to Bill and why he chose to become a Panthers' fan. Bill wanted to choose a football team to support because  _  .",

        "question": "There are new findings that not enough sleep may cause people to gain weight.Researchers say a lack of sleep can produce hormonal changes that increase feelings of hunger. In one study,researchers in the United States examined information on more than 1000 people.The people had taken part in a long-term study of sleep disorders. Some people slept less than five hours a night.They had 15 percent higher blood levels of a hormone called ghrelin than people who slept eight hours.And they had 15 percent less of the hormone leptin.Experts say ghrelin helps make people feel hungry;leptin makes you feel full. The scientists say these hormonal changes may be a cause of obesity in Western societies.They note the combination that limitation is common and is widely available. The results were not affected by how much people exercised.People who are awake longer have more time to burn energy.But the researchers say loss of sleep may increase hunger especially  for high-calorie foods,so people gain weight.It seems that,for survival,the body may be designed to store more fat during times with less sleep. Researchers from Stanford University in California and the University of Wisconsin did the study.They found that the best amount of sleep for weight control is 7.7 hours a night. The Public Library of Science published the findings in its journal Medicine.Internet users can read the full study,free of charge,at plos.org.

        "question": "In my opinion, there is only one legitimate   handgun sport and that is aim practice. It is practiced at objects which are properly monitored and usually quite safe. Only certain handguns are true \"sporting weapons\", seen as such by the sport's lovers. On the other hand, shooting at tin cans and other small objects in one's backyard is not and should not be considered a serious sport. When uncontrolled, it can be a very dangerous practice. Some opponents   of handgun control have stated that we are out to stop all hunting and that controlling the handgun would severely affect hunting. That is simply untrue. Handgun control would in no way limit the freedom of the true hunter. Few if any hunters consider the handgun an effective hunting weapon. There are a few hunters who do hunt with handguns, but most states place restrictions   on the type of guns that can be used in hunting, the reason is that killing of game should be done in as humane   a way as possible. Some small handguns are more likely to wound the animal rather than kill it at once. Only long guns, rifles and shotguns are effective arms of hunting. People must understand that handguns and hunters are separate matters. Because most of the hunters use a rifle or shotgun, there is no reason why their search for game and sport should be affected by handgun control. Mixing the anti-hunting matter with the handgun matter confuses the killing of animals with killing of people. In the writer's opinion, people should use handguns only when    _    .",

        "question": "Reducing the amount of sleep students get at night has a direct impact on their performance at school during the day. According to classroom teachers, elementary and middle school students who stay up late exhibit more learning and attention problems. This has been shown by Brown Medical School and prefix = st1 /BradleyHospitalresearch. In the study, teachers were not told the amount of sleep students received when completing weekly performance reports, yet they rated the students who had received eight hours or less as having the most trouble recalling all the material, learning new lessons and completing high - quality work. Teachers also reported that these students had more difficulty paying attention. The experiment is the first to ask teachers to report on the effects of sleep deficiency in children. Just staying up late can cause increased academic difficulty and attention problems for otherwise healthy, well - functioning kids, said Garharn Forlone, the study's lead author. So the results provide professionals and parents with a clear message: when a child is having learning and attention problems, the issue of sleep has to be taken into consideration. \"If we don't ask about sleep, and try to improve sleep patterns in kids' struggling academically, then we aren't doing our job\", Forlone said. For parents, he said, the message is simple, \"getting kids to bed on time is as important as getting them to school on time.\" What were teachers told to do in the experiment?",

Holding a nickel  , I'd run to the back of the vehicle, where children were already gathering. Jolly Joe would jump out of his truck, the sun shining on his hair. He was an older man, short and round, with a pleasant face and a welcoming smile. I don't know how, but he knew us all by name, as well as which treats we preferred. My favorite was the Buried Treasure. By eating all the ice cream, you'd discover the treasure inside: a lion, a dog or even a funny clown -- printed onto a plastic stick. When it was finally my turn, he'd put his arm deep inside one of the boxes, and pause   for a moment, a puzzled look crossing his face. Then, suddenly, he'd pull it out: the Buried Treasure! I couldn't wait to enjoy the cool, sweet ice cream. As quickly as he arrived, it was time for Jolly Joe to go, leaving behind laughing, excited children with sticky hands and faces. Soon the sound of his clanging bell would slowly disappear in the distance. I always hated to see Jolly Joe go, because I knew the rest of the day would be as hot and boring as before.

The Texan spent a lot of time telling him how everything was bigger and better in Texas. After the blind man reached his destination, a large resort   hotel, he was very excited about being in Texas. The long trip had worn him out a little so he decided to stop at the bar for a small soda and a light snack before going up to his room to sleep. When the waitress set down his drink, it was in a huge cup. \"Wow, I had heard everything in Texas is bigger,\" he told her. \"That's right,\" she replied. The blind man ate his snack and finished his drink. After drinking such a large amount, it was natural that his next stop was to be the restroom. He asked the waitress for directions. She told him to turn left at the corner, and then take the second door on the right. He reached the first door and continued. A few steps later he stumbled   slightly and missed the second door and ended up going through the third door instead. Not realizing he had entered the swimming area he walked forward and immediately fell into the swimming pool. Remembering that everything was bigger in Texas, he had his head above water and started shouting \"Don't flush ! Don't flush!\" If the passage is taken from a website, which part of the website does it belong to?",

        "question": "The Earth has warmed by about half a degree(0.50degC)over the last 100 years. It could be getting warmer on its own, but many scientists think that people are making the Earth warmer by making a greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is important.  Without it, the Earth would not be warm enough for us to live on. But just a little warmer than it is now could cause problems for humans, plants and animals. Many of the things we do every day can change the Earth's temperature by sending greenhouse gases into the air. We send greenhouse gases into the air when we watch TV, turn on lights, dry hair, play video games, wash or dry our clothes or drive cars. The rubbish from factories and homes also produces greenhouse gases. Even a small change in temperature can affect our weather. This can cause changes in the sea levels, the air, flooding, and our fresh water. The change in the temperature can also cause changes in the living places for animals and plants, endangering many animals. Global warming is a big problem, and every little bit we do can help. We can save electricity. We can save energy in other ways such as by taking buses or walking rather than driving cars. We can recycle to reduce the rubbish and save natural resources such as trees, oil and metals. We can buy products that don't do bad to the environment and we can turn to solar energy. Remember the little bit that you do will bring a better world. The writer gives us advice on how to save energy in   _   .",

        "question": "Paris Passengers carried per day: 4.4m Cost of ticket: 80p flat fare Length: 131 miles    Lines: 14   Stations: 297 In Paris there are pleasures for those who use the Metro  -- many of them artistic. The graceful Art Nouveau dragon-fly entrances are just the most noticeable on a Metro system which celebrated its 100thanniversary by spending 30 million francs (PS2.9million) on making its stations works of art. On my way home I pass Bonne Nouvelle station in the heart of Paris's cinema district. There, during the cinema festival this summer, special lighting effects dot the platforms and films are projected onto the large advertising boards. More than anything the metro is efficient. \"When I worked on line 4\", says a retired driver, \"we had exactly 30 minutes and 15 seconds to complete the journey. If it took any longer, they cut our pay.\" But there are problems. Many Metro stations have too many stairs, and changing lines at big interchanges  can be tiresome. Moscow Passengers carried per day: 9m Cost of ticket: 12p Length: 164 miles    Lines: 11   Stations: 162 The first underground passage for the Moscow Metropolitan started in 1932. Three years later the trains started running. They haven't stopped since-- every 90 seconds or two minutes during rush hour, every five minutes the rest of the time, from 6 a.m. till 1 a. m. There may be a crowd of people but there is seldom a wait. The trains take you through spacious and spotless stations. For tourists it's a major sightseeing attraction: from Russian Art Deco to neo-classical, the Metro stations are not to be missed. Tokyo Passengers carried per day: 7m Cost of ticket: 90p ~ PS1.68 Length: 177 miles    Lines: 12   Stations: 209 Trains do not just arrive on time in Tokyo. They stop right on the platform mark so that passengers can line up knowing exactly where the doors will open. Train driving is a respectful job for life, for which the applicants must pass a strict screening of health checks, interviews and written exams before they can put on the enviable uniform, cap and white gloves. However, overcrowding means it is far from perfect. At rush hours, some stations employ part-time platform staff to push in passengers. Carriages can be filled to 184% of capacity . The main reason for such conditions is that the Tokyo subway station system has only 15 miles of track for every 1 million people, compared to 36 on the London Underground. New lines are under construction, but at a cost of PS500,000 per meter of rail. Progress has been slow. Mexico City Passengers carried per day: 4.2m Cost of ticket: 11p flat fare Length: 99 miles    Lines: 11   Stations: 175 Fast, relatively safe, and very cheap, Mexico City's underground is an ideal place of order and efficiency compared to the disorders above. The Mexican capital's underground system is the biggest in the continent and one of the most subsidized   networks in the world. The first trains leave the station at 5 a.m. and the last after midnight as the crowd move from the outskirts of the 20 million-strong megacity  . Mexico City's Metro also attracts a sizeable group of passengers who are unwilling to spend hours in traffic jams. There is a master plan to build new lines and extend existing one, but financial constraints   complicated by the fact that the system runs through different jurisdicitons   mean progress is slow.

        "question": "Worlds of Fun Location: Worlds of Fun is located off Highway 435 in Kansas City, Missouri. History: Worlds of Fun was opened on May 26, 1973, at a cost of 25 million dollars. Loosely themed around the Jules Verne book, Around the World in Eighty Days, the park was founded by Hunt Midwest Company. In 1982, Hunt Midwest bought a nearby waterpark, Oceans of Fun. In 2013, Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun were combined to a one ticket admission, providing all guests with access to 235 acres of amusement and water rides. Hours:  Worlds of Fun is open from April through Halloween. Tickets: Buy and print online. Always try to buy your tickets in advance, to save time when you get to the park. Reservations: Worlds of Fun sells \"Fast Lane\" cards that save riders' time by allowing them to bypass the majority of wait for most of rides and attractions including Mamba, Prowler, and Patriot. Ride as many times as you want all day long. Strategy : Most visitors tend to begin the day with Prowler, the hottest attraction in the park. Use that tendency to your advantage and head to the Patriot first. After that, try the Dragons. Then work your way back to the Prowler. After riding the Prowler, there is only one coaster left, Mamba. Hit it next. If the park is not very crowded, you can ride Boomerang on the way to Mamba. After riding Mamba, head back for a ride on the Wolf. By then you will have tried most of the popular rides and attractions in the shortest possible time. News: In 2014, Worlds of Fun is adding Steel Hawk, a ride that will take guests up 301 feet in the air and spin them at a 45-degree angle for a 60-second flight. Wait to have a try!

        "question": "Teaching Boys: Developing classroom practices that work Amanda Keddie and Martin Mills Bridges the gap between theory and practice to offer a practical and sustainable framework for teaching boys in classrooms of all levels. Sales points     Teaching boys remains one of the most concerned issues in education today. Many books have been published analysing why boys perform less well than girls, and why some boys struggle at school. But they don't show teachers what will work: this book does. The authors offer a research-based framework for classroom strategies that work with boys--and don't disadvantage girls. Description Boys' education continues to be a focus of public anxiety among teachers. Concern about boys' general educational under-achievement and the impact this under-achievement has on the boys themselves, as well as on the broader society, continues to fuel disagreement and debate on the best approach to take in response. Teaching Boys provides a framework for developing practical and sustainable ways to improve boys' education. The book indicates how what teachers do in the classroom can enable boys' academic and social outcomes. With detailed case studies, Keddie & Mills outline a range of practical classroom strategies that will assist teachers to meet the challenge of teaching boys, without neglecting the girls in the process. About the Authors Amanda Keddie is a researcher at the University of Queensland. Her research interests and teaching areas focus on classroom teaching, curriculum and educational sociology. Martin Mills is Associate Professor in the School of Education at the University of Queensland. He has written several books, and is co-author of Teachers and Schooling Making a Difference (Allen & Unwin, 2010). The book Teaching Boys is intended for   _  .",

        "question": "A habit is an action that we have acted so often that it becomes something we do almost without thinking. Some of them are not good habits. People spend countless hours and dollars each year trying to give up these bad habits but often fail. Why? Change is hard work and there is no shortcut to get it. However, there is still some advice for you to follow. First, look at why you do it. In other words, what's the result  of doing this thing? If your bad habit is shouting at people when you are unhappy or under pressure , what do you get from it? It may make you feel a little better for the moment. Or maybe you have a bad habit of leaving your homework undone. The result could be that you get more time to spend on the Internet! Next, take a look on the other hand. What are you losing because of your habit? Shouting at other people is a bad habit because it makes people around you feel bad and unhappy. Leaving your homework undone is a bad habit because you may be punished by your teacher. Having more Internet time means that you are losing the chance to learn the things you need to learn. When you think that way, you'll find that it's not wise to keep your bad habit! Now it is time to make a decision . What will you choose? I'm sure you will choose to do something that is more important. The best title for this passage is   _  .",

        "question": "The constant demands, together with the exhausting effects of interrupted sleep, can make it hard to find the time and energy to exercise or prepare healthy meals.  Here are some tips for common problems new moms face: Problem: No time to cook proper meals. When you're caring for a baby, cooking proper meals seems like a luxury. Instead you rely on convenience meals and processed foods.         Solution: Try to get more support. Friends, family members, and neighbors are often delighted to help, so don't feel you have to do everything yourself. Use the extra time to prepare some healthy meals. Follow the basic rules of cutting down on fat and increasing fruit and vegetable intake. Problem: Sugary or high-fat snacks. Tiredness can leave you feeling sleepy, run-down, and in need of an immediate help from sweets and high-fat snacks.         Solution: Turn snacking to your advantage. Eat high-fiber, low-fat, low-sugar snacks; these will fill you up without adding too many calories. For an energy boost, eat a banana, which is high in potassium -- a mineral essential for muscle and nerve function -- or try a handful of raisins , which are high in iron but low in fat.         Problem: No time or energy to exercise. A baby is a constant demand on your time, so you're too tired or busy to exercise.        Solution: Increasing activity levels will help you obtain a net calorie loss, while toning exercises will tighten your muscles. Though you may feel too tired to do any exercise, it is worth persevering (,) because in the long run your energy levels will increase. Involve your baby in your postnatal   exercises; start by walking with the child in a carriage or sling(;). Swimming is another aerobic  exercise that you can both enjoy by joining a mother and baby class. Many pools have childcare facilities, so you can swim a few laps on your own. Problem: Lack of sleep. The new baby interrupts your sleep,  _ your energy and leaving you tense and exhausted.        Solution: Practice some relaxation techniques whenever you have a few free moments. Meditation, visualization, or yoga can help your body recover and give you more energy. Which of the following is true?",

        "question": "Your friends might be in Australia or maybe just down the road, but they are all just a few clicks away. Life has changed for millions of young people across the world who now make friends online. Whether you use chat-rooms, QQ, MSN or ICQ, you are a member of this group. \"I don't often talk with my parents or grandparents, but I talk a lot with my old friends on QQ,\" said Fox's Shadow, the online name used by a girl student in China. \"Most of my classmates use QQ after school.\" QQ is the biggest messaging service in China. A record from Tencent, the company which developed QQ, shows that 4 million people used it one Saturday night in October. And probably Fox's Shadow was one of them. \"I  _ on Friday nights, and Saturdays or Sundays when I feel everything around me boring. I usually spend about ten hours chatting online every week,\" she said. \"But I never talk with strangers, especially boys or men.\" Even though she likes chatting, she is careful about making friends with strangers online. \"You don't know who you're talking to. You should always be careful about whom you believe in online.\" Many people would like to meet offline when they feel they have known someone very well. Fox's Shadow once met one of her online friends face to face. It was a girl who was a football fan like herself and they went to a football match together. A 16-year-old Beijing boy, named Bart Simon online, dislikes QQ users. \"I used to chat on QQ, but I found that most people were talking about foolish things,\" he said. Now he chats online in English, using MSN. \"I only chat online because I've got friends in Japan, the US and Singapore,\" he said. \"I want to learn more about foreign cultures.\" But he spends little time chatting on QQ as he sees it as a waste of time and money.  \"If you are really addicted to it, sometimes you can't give your mind to your lessons,\" he said. \"And friends in your real life are always more important than those so-called friends you meet online.\" Which of the following sentences is TRUE according to the passage?",

It was a dark, cold morning, and everywhere was filled with snow. As I reached the bus stop, I found a white-haired couple  had already been waiting. \"You see, you didn't sleep at all night and got here so early,\" the man murmured( ) to his wife. The bus finally came. The driver was a very young man. He waited just long enough for me to get on before he started the bus again. \"Please wait,\" I said to the driver. \"There are two older people that need to get on, too. It is so cold, and they have waited for a long time. How could you leave them behind?\" Without stopping the bus, the young driver said\"That's OK, they are my parents.

My mobile phone rang, incoming was my father's message, \"Sweetie, your mom is not feeling well, she was awake most of the night so that she wouldn't miss your wakeup call.\" The wakeup call, the older couple, the young driver...reminded me of a Jewish proverb: \"When a father gives something to his son, the son smiles; when a son gives something to his father, the father cries.\" The writer makes the idea clear by    _   .",

        "question": "Don't worry, be happy and, according to new research, you will also be healthy. It is estimated that over the course of one year, Americans suffer 1 billion colds. But new research shows that all it may take to avoid this common affliction is a positive and upbeat attitude.          People who are energetic, happy and relaxed are less likely to catch a cold than those who are depressed, nervous or angry, finds a new study published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine. Healthy volunteers first underwent an emotional assessment in which they were asked to rate their tendency to experience positive and negative emotions--how often they felt pleased, relaxed, happy, or anxious, depressed and hostile. The subjects were next given a squirt up the nose of a rhinovirus, the nasty little germ that causes colds.          Researchers then watched the volunteers to see who came down with a cold and waited to see how the unlucky ill manifested their cold symptoms. \"We found that people who regularly experience positive emotions, when exposed to rhinovirus, are  ly protected from developing illness,\" said Dr. Sheldon Cohen, lead author of the study and a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University.\" Increases in positive emotional styles were linked with decreases in the rate of clinical colds, but a negative emotional style had no effect on whether or not people got sick,\" Cohen said.          So how can your emotions influence your health? In simple terms, when the brain is \"happy\" it sends messages to our organs that help keep the body healthy and sound.\" It's like a drug that is released by your state of mind and simply changing the state of mind can produce effects on the rest of the body through the nervous system and hormones,\" said Dr. Neil Shulman, associate professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine and author of Doc Hollywood. \"Your chance of developing the common cold, pneumonia, or even cancer may very well be decreased by keeping your brain in a healthy state.\"          In addition, happy and relaxed people tend to better health practices than their negative and stressed counterparts. They are more likely to get plenty of sleep and to engage in regular exercise, and have been shown to have lower levels of certain stress hormones. Which is the best possible title of the passage?",

        "question": "All across California, honeybees are flying away from their hives  and dying. Empty hives are causing a lot of worry about some important food crops. Bees give us a lot more than delicious honey. They are pollinators --they enable plants to produce the fruits and nuts we enjoy by carrying pollen from one plant or flower to the next. The wind pollinates oats, corn, and wheat, but many other plants (like apple and cherry trees and melon vines) depend on insects, bats, and birds. In the U.S., millions and millions of bees kept by human beekeepers fly around doing a lot of this important work for food crops. \"Bees are worth protecting because their work adds so much to our diet,\" says Dr. Jeff Pettis of the Bee Research Laboratory. California's almond   crop alone depends on about half the bees in the country. But now the almond crop and many others could be in trouble with so many bees dying. Researchers at government and university labs all over the country are trying to figure out why so many bees are dying. However, bees are hard to study. Most die away from the hive, so researchers don't have dead bodies to examine. And when researchers return to a hive after two weeks, about half the bees they studied on their first visit will be dead, replaced by new ones in the natural life cycle of bees. \"It isn't like studying a large animal like a cow that doesn't move around much and is easy to find out in the cow field,\" says Pettis. Researchers have some ideas about what could be affecting bee health. They could be sick from poisons widely used to kill insects, or they might not be getting enough good food to stay strong. Also, tiny insects called mites feed on bees. \"A virus or bacteria could also be doing the killing.\" explains Pettis. Bees are hard to study because   _  .",

        "question": "At thirteen, I was diagnosed  with  kind of attention disorder. It made school difficult for me. When everyone else in the class was focusing on tasks, I could not. In my first literature class, Mrs.Smith asked us to read a story and then write on it, all within 45 minutes. I raised my hand right away and said,\"Mrs.Smith, you see, the doctor said I have attention problems. I might not be able to do it.\" She glanced down at me through her glasses, \"you are no different from your classmates, young man.\" I tried, but I didn't finish the reading when the bell rang. I had to take it home. In the quietness of my bedroom, the story suddenly all became clear to me. It was about a blind person, Louis Braille. He lived in a time when the blind couldn't get much education. But Louis didn't give up. Instead, he invented a reading system of raised dots , which opened up a whole new world of knowledge to the blind. Wasn't I the \"blind\" in my class, being made to learn like the \"sighted\" students? My thoughts spilled out and my pen started to dance. I completed the task within 40 minutes. Indeed, I was no different from others; I just needed a quieter place. If Louis could find his way out of his problems, why should I ever give up? I didn't expect anything when I handed in my paper to Mrs.Smith, so it was quite a surprise when it came back to me the next day- with an\"A\" on it. At the bottom of the paper were these words:\" See what you can do when you keep trying?\" What do we know about Louis Braille from the passage?",

My mom said she had gone to her class. Then the four of us, along with many others, were running on the staircase. We lived on the seventh floor, so I thought we would not be able to make it and the building would fall before we managed to reach even the fourth floor. My dad's head was injured by something falling down. I did try to put my hand over his head. When we reached the sixth floor, the building split into two. We had no way to get down. The next thing I remember is silence. There were around 30 people on the staircase and none could react. Five minutes later, someone opened the door of the sixth-floor flat. We all went in. we were wondering how we would get down. From the balcony of the sixth-floor flat, I saw people standing on the ground floor. All eyes were stuck on us. I could see my elder sister crying. Our first hope of surviving came when a worker climbed a rope to where we were. That was ,the first time we thought maybe we could get down. Half an hour passed and we were still trapped. Finally RSS people arrived with ropes. They got people down one by one. My biggest worry was how my dad would get down.

        "question": "The British are very polite and have good manners--they are never tired of saying \"Thank you\",\"I am sorry\", or \"Excuse me.\" They have good table manners. They enjoy their breakfasts and most of all the traditional tea around 4 or 5 o'clock. The normal working week has five days. Factory workers usually start at 8 am and offices, shops and schools open at 9 am. Workers have 3 weeks' holidays and professional workers(people with higher education ) have usually longer holidays (a month or more). Except these holidays they have public holidays: e.g. New Year's Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Christmas Day and Boxing Day. An average Englishman like to live in his own house. Houses are made of red bricks, stone and wood. The house usually has from 4 to 6 rooms, two floors, small front and back gardens. On the ground floor there is a hall, a kitchen, a living room with a fireplace and on the first floor there are parents' and children's bedrooms and a bathroom. The prices of houses depend on the area--the most expensive are the houses in London and South England (about 200,000 pounds); smaller houses in other areas may cost about 50,000 pounds. Social Welfare--The National Health Service gives largely free treatment for everyone living in Britain. People can choose their family doctors. In case of emergency you can call the ambulance by dialing 999 from everywhere. Health centres are run by local authorities. About 7 percent of hospitals, dentists and family doctors work as private. There are about 130 daily and Sunday newspapers and a lot of weekly papers and magazines. The oldest newspaper is The Times. Other famous newspapers are Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, Financial Times, etc. Which of the following about the British is false according to the passage?",

She gives life to all the living things on the earth and provides us with air, food, water and other essential things we need for living. Once she was beautiful and rich, but now she becomes dirtier and dirtier, poorer and poorer. It is due to what we have done to her. Please have a good look at her: polluted rivers and lakes, growing deserts, the destruction of the forests and wild life, and the depletion (,) of the ozone layer  ... Can she bear to see her children putting the waste here and there? Can she bear to see her children cutting down the trees and destroying the grassland, to see the acid rain destroying everything? Can we bear to see our mother suffering   so much? Isn't it time for us to ask ourselves whether this is the way to treat our mother? Floods, droughts, acid rain..., these are the punishments   from nature. Everyone should know that there is only one earth.

        "question": "Some say college is wasted on the young. So many of us look back at our own college years and realize what we could have done differently to make the most of them. While we can't go back, we certainly can offer our sons and daughters our best advice to help them make the right choices in college. Hopefully, they will have fewer regrets than we do. Following are five guidelines parents can share with their college-bound kids to put the whole experience in perspective. EDUCATION IS YOUR FIRST PRIORITY As soon as you arrive on campus, there will be competing interests. Feel free to check them out but always remember that you are there first and foremost for your education. Go to class prepared and on time. Be engaged during class. Make sure your professor knows you and realizes that you care. BE RESPONSIBLE There are many layers of responsibility. Do what you say you will do and, if you can't, own up to it early and communicate clearly. But being responsible isn't just about meeting your commitments; it is also about taking care of you, your body, and your friends. For example, more than 1800 college students die annually from alcohol-related injuries. Look out for yourself and other people. Make moderate, sensible decisions so you aren't reeling from the consequences later. TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY Incredible opportunities will present themselves: studying abroad, interning at a unique place, trying new things. Don't let fear prevent you from taking advantage of them. There may never be so much time or as many resources devoted to your betterment again in your life. Say yes to opportunities that will help you grow. FIND AND BE A MENTOR Some of the best lessons available to us can come outside of the classroom in the form of a mentor. One of the most powerful growth opportunities is being a mentor. Early on, find someone on campus who you feel can help you grow and develop a relationship with him or her. Also find someone for you to mentor. You will reinforce and enrich your own learning experience by teaching someone else. GET THE JOB DONE It is natural to occasionally feel you want to quit, when it makes more sense to you to go find a full-time job. Resist that urge. As Jocelyn Negron-Rios, a mother of two, who is currently completing her degree, advises, \"No matter how difficult it seems, keep at it because however insurmountable it feels now multiply that by 10,000 and that is how it feels when you are in your thirties with a full-time job and a family and are trying to pursue a degree.\" Which of the following about college life is true?",
        "options": {
          "A": "Passing on what you've learned in college can help you enrich your learning experience.",
          "B": "Make sure that you are responsible for yourself rather than others.",
          "C": "Professors will not assess your performances in class but the grades you get in exams.",
          "D": "You can make full use of the opportunity whenever you want."

According to a survey, 25%of the Grade 8 students in Beijing have classes on the weekend. Over 38% of the middle school students have less than eight hours' sleep, because of the hard study. Nan Weitong is a Grade7 student in Hubei. The girl has to get up at 6:30 am on Saturday. Then she has a whole day of classes. On Sunday, she has classes for math and English. She says her classmates all work very hard. However, some students are much luckier. They don't have to go to school on weekends. Zhang Qian, a Grade 9 student from Jinan, is one of them. On the weekend, she usually gets up at 8:00am. Then she spends some time on her homework. After that, she goes shopping or watches TV.

        "question": "In the past, young people inprefix = st1 /Japanwere expected to take on responsibilities to support their parents and grandparents. Now they expect to be supported well into young adulthood. The \"New breed\", born since the 1960s, have never known anything but richness. Youth are seen as resistant to entering society as mature adults, to becoming social citizens. Once the great objective of reconstruction after the Second World War was accomplished, a new generation lost the motivating power that had untied the nation together.  Japan's birth rate has been falling rapidly, partly because of the recession , and the job and financial insecurity that it has caused. In 1999, the figure was 1. 38 children per woman, the lowest ever recorded. At the same time, youth crime, although still especially low by western standards, rose to its highest level since record-keeping began 32 years ago. Likewise, the percentage of students dropping out before graduating, at 2. 5% also very low by western standards, has been rising.  Entrepreneurial ( ) role models are few and far between. Bill Gates is often mentioned, but a foreign model can only have so much influence. The problem is that Japanese culture discourages people from revealing details of personal life, including such ordeal as starting a company. In the past, successful companies such as Honda or Hitachiprovided role models of a sort. But today they have been faded by the downturn, and few others have risen to take their place.  Young people also quite often feel isolated from their fathers, who worked too hard at their jobs to establish much of a relationship with their children. \"The one thing they're sure of is that they don't want to be like their fathers. And the girls don't want to be with boys who are like their fathers, so the boys are sure not to be,\" says Professor Morishma.

        "question": "Matt's hobby was collecting stamps. He had stamps from many countries, like America, Egypt and China. On his birthday, can you guess what people gave him? That's right----stamps. Matt's favorite stamps came from France. He had almost every stamp from 1954 to 2003 except one. That was a 1974 special edition  . It was very hard to find. He looked for it everywhere. He asked his friends and relatives to help him. But nobody could find the stamp. It made Matt very sad. \"Don't worry,\" his father said to him. \"You'll find it one day.\" \"I hope so,\" Matt said. \"Be patient  ,\"his father said. \"Don't give up.\" Besides collecting stamps, Matt liked writing. He had a pen friend in France. They wrote to each other every month. Matt's pen friend, Philip, gave him a big, green stamp. It looked old. When Matt received the letter, he was very surprised. On the envelope, he looked closely at the stamp. It was the 1974 special edition stamp. Matt was so happy! He told his sister, his mother and his father. \"You see,\" his father said, \"You did find your stamp. So, you see, it's good to have two things in life.\" \"What are they?\" Matt asked. \"Friends and patience  .\" he answered. _  sent Matt the letter with the special edition stamp on it.",

        "question": "Miya volunteered abroad in Costa Rica with World Endeavors assisting at an orphanage and teaching English at a school. As a freshman at Yale University, Miya had plans to go to medical school.Knowing that her next two summers would be occupied doing research, Miya decided to go abroad the summer after her freshman year.\"I wanted to improve my command of the Spanish language and learn about the culture and history of another country,\" she explained.In the summer of 2014, Miya volunteered for six weeks in the World Endeavors program in Atenas, Costa Rica, working in an orphanage and teaching English to children in grades one through six. \"A long time before I left, I had positive expectations for the trip,\" said Miya.But as the date grew closer she found herself getting more and more nervous.\"I thought, what if my host family doesn't like me? What if I get sick?\" Her fears, as fears often are, turned out to be unfounded.\"The people were so supportive and loving,\" said Miya.\"I felt like I was part of the family.\" Miya's host family had a large network of cousins who all lived within shouting distance. The family would cook together, and at night would go dancing, talk or eat ice cream.She noted that the World Endeavors staff on location--Diego and Mercedes, and Mercedes' husband and daughter -were particularly helpful, taking her right to her neighborhood from the airport, and checking up periodically to make sure everything was going well. While her nights were spent dancing, cooking, and talking with her host family, Miya's days were occupied with the children of her host city.\"I would teach in the morning, and work in the orphanage in the afternoon,\" said Miya, whose placements were within walking distance from her host family.While the children were a lot of work, Miya felt a strong connection to the kids in the orphanage. Miya noted that Costa Rica is one of the more developed countries in Central America. A nearby Internet cafe, for example, helped her to stay in touch with her family while she was away.And now, back in the United States, the Internet helps her keep in touch with her host family.Their correspondence continues in Spanish.And her host parents, Rosario and Jorge, recently sent Miya a Christmas card through the mail. Back at school, Miya continues to pursue her instinct to improve education through volunteering. She participates in a mentoring group and works on a community health education program for high school students.Her time in Costa Rica, she says, \"fits right into my interests in global health.\" Which of the following is correct about Miya?",

        "question": "Today it seems perfectly natural for us to shake hands when we greet someone or say goodbye. But like so many things that we do without thinking such actions at one time probably represented something. For example, in primitive  life the hand was used to fight enemies, kill animals, and make spears and tools. So when the hand was extended to someone, it showed that the person was not armed or ready for fight. We know that the hand was an important symbol in early religion, probably as a mark of power. The Greeks prayed to their gods with raised hands. Presenting the hands palm to palm was at one time the way an inferior  person paid respect to a superior  one. Among the Arabs, it was customary at one time to kiss the hand of a superior. Later on, polite Arabs began to resist the efforts of people to kiss their hands, and sometimes they would end up shaking hands as each tried to prevent the other from showing this mark of \"inferiority .\" The early Greeks held out the right hand when they wished to show friendship to a stranger. So we can see that the hand, and what was done with it, was full of meaning to people down through the ages. And while we shake hands without thinking, we are really carrying on a custom that has been  _ to us from ancient times. The phrase \" hand down\" in the last sentence means   _  .",

Having the best agency to help with your business, no matter how small, can be one of the biggest steps you can take in letting the world know and get familiar with your products and brands. Brand agencies work hand in hand with the company in advertising the brand and its products. The company has to tell the agency how they would like the public to see their products. The agency then talks with the company about the progress of the brand in the market. Working with brand agencies is a two-way street. When the company is happy and satisfied with how the agency has advertised the brand, the trust the company has in the agency grows. Similarly, when the agency does well in its work, the company's brand and products get good ideas from buyers and the market. Regarding the identity of the brand, agencies can help a lot in this aspect. For a brand to have a lasting influence on the buyers, an identity of the brand needs to be formed.

        "question": "The speaker, a teacher from a community college, addressed a sympathetic  audience. Heads nodded in agreement when he said, \"High school English teachers are not doing their jobs.\" He described the inadequacies of his students, all high school graduates who can use language only at a grade 9 level. I was unable to determine from his answers to my questions how this grade 9 level had been established. My topic is not standards nor its decline . What the speaker was really saying is that he is no longer young; he has been teaching for sixteen years, and is able to think and speak like a mature adult. My point is that the frequent complaint of one generation about the one immediately following it is inevitable. It is also human nature to look for the reasons for our dissatisfaction. Before English became a school subject in the late nineteenth century, it was difficult to find the target of the blame for language deficiencies  . But since then, English teachers have been under constant attack. The complainers think they have hit upon an original idea. As their own command of the language improves, they notice that young people do not have this same ability. Unaware that their own ability has developed through the years, they assume the new generation of young people must be hopeless in this respect. To the eyes and ears of sensitive adults the language of the young always seems inadequate. Since this concern about the decline and fall of the English language is not perceived  as a generational phenomenon but rather as something new and peculiar  to today's         young people, it naturally follows that today's English teachers cannot be doing their jobs. Otherwise, young people would not commit offenses against the language. In the passage the author argues that   _  .",

Since then, Barbie doll, as everyone called her, has become the most successful toy doll in history.  Her parent, the Mattel Company, said that 90% of all American girls between 3 and 10 have at least one Barbie at home. However, Barbie is facing some trouble at present . There are many similar dolls on the market in competition with her. Another doll named Bratz, for example, came to life thirteen years ago. She looks more like today's pop stars with heavy makeup  and miniskirts. And her company offers more kinds of clothes too. It seems that Barbie has lost her magic among older girls. 'For younger girls, playing with a Barbie is much fun. But when you get older, you want something smarter and more modern,' says Vera Shepherd, a shop assistant in a New York toy store. It is good news that on the international market, Barbie is still No. 1. Although Mattel is selling fewer barbie in the United States these years, sales in other countries are still going up.  In January 2009, Mattel opened its first Barbie store in Shanghai, where girls can shop, eat, drink or even become _ for their own Barbies. Mattel is planning big celebrations for Barbie's 53rd birthday. She has called Fashion designers from all over the world to make new dresses for Barbie.

        "question": "Here's a hotel worth writing home about:a company in Poland plans to build tourist accommodation under the sea.The structure can be dragged to a suitable location and placed on supports on the sea bed.     The 'Water Discus' will be made up of an underwater disc containing 22 bedrooms with sea views, connected by lift and stairs to a disc above the surface containing other hotel facilities.      Project manager Robert Bursiewicz says:\"Nowadays it's possible to build submarilles  which go deeper than 500m below the sea surface,so building an underwater hotel is not a problem.\"      In fact,they don't plan to have the hotel very deep.Water acts like a filter for sunlight, and below l5m most colours,apart from blue,are washed out.And we all want to see colourful marine life,don't we?     But this isn't the first hotel to offer underwater views from the bedrooms.The two-bedroom Jules' Undersea Lodge,off the coast of Florida,has been taking in guests 10m beneath the surface since 1986.     The company that operates the hotel also runs a diving course for beginners to help get guests down and into the hotel.It is accessible only through an opening at the bottom.     And you'll find all the usual facilities in the room,according to Teresa McKirma,Jules's chief financial officer.It has a television,air conditioning and wi--fi.But for the staft, simple things like cleaning and making beds can be challenging,since the lodge is in sea water.     ''It actually takes quite a lot of work to get anything down there,\"she says.\"We have to put everything in waterproof boxes and attach weights to them to counter their buoymacy .\"      The hotel has suitably sized waterproof boxes so that pizzas can be delivered by divers to guests wllo order them for their evening meal.And after a meal,if you can't sleep because of the excitement of the experience,you don't have to count sheep.You'll fall asleep quicker if you count fish.
