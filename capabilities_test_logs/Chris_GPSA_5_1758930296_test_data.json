        "question": "Astronomers are studying a system of five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered through the TTV method. The planets (designated as Planet_1 through Planet_5), which are in orbital resonance, have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Assuming these planets possess the same albedo, what is the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2?",

The diamond and graphite are in the state of thermodynamic equilibrium in the magma chamber when the temperature increases by 100.0 K. By how much the pressure should change in order to maintain the thermodynamic equilibrium between the diamond and the graphite? The molar volume of diamond is 3.417 cm³/mol and the molar entropy of diamond is 2.38 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹. The molar volume of graphite is 5.298 cm³/mol and the molar entropy of graphite is 5.74 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.\n",
