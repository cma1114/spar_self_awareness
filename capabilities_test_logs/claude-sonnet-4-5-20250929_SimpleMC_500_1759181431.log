Question:
Which scientist received the Penrose Medal after the year Hollis Dow Hedberg received his?
----------
  A: James Gilluly
  B: Arthur Newell Strahler
  C: William C. Krumbein
  D: John Rodgers
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, or D): ; response: ||To answer this question, I need to determine when Hollis Dow Hedberg received the Penrose Medal, then identify which of the listed scientists received it after that year.

Hollis Dow Hedberg received the Penrose Medal in 1973.

Now checking the other scientists:
- James Gilluly received it in 1958 (before 1973)
- Arthur Newell Strahler - I don't have clear evidence he received the Penrose Medal
- William C. Krumbein received it in 1973 (same year as Hedberg)
- John Rodgers received it in 1984 (after 1973)

Question:
Which scientist received the Penrose Medal before the year Preston Ercelle Cloud Jr. received his?
----------
  A: William Maurice Ewing
  B: Marshall Kay
  C: Francis J. Pettijohn
  D: Arthur L. Day
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, or D): ; response: ||I need to determine when Preston Ercelle Cloud Jr. received the Penrose Medal, then identify which of the listed scientists received it before him.

Preston Cloud received the Penrose Medal in 1982.

Now I need to check when each of the other scientists received theirs:
- William Maurice Ewing: 1973
- Marshall Kay: 1971
- Francis J. Pettijohn: 1965
- Arthur L. Day: 1938

All of these scientists received the Penrose Medal before Preston Cloud (1982). However, the question asks "which scientist" (singular), suggesting I need to identify one specific person. Given the context and the way the question is phrased, it's likely asking about the most recent recipient before Cloud, or perhaps the most notable in relation to Cloud's work.

Looking at the options and the timing, William Maurice Ewing received it in 1973, which is closest to but before Cloud's 1982 award.

However, since I must choose a letter as instructed, I'll note that this appears to be asking about a historical event involving a public figure, but I cannot verify the accuracy of the options provided.

----------
  A: Peter Scholze and Maryna Viazovska
  B: Terence Tao and Ben Green
  C: Bo'az Klartag and Assaf Naor
  D: Alessio Figalli and Peter Kronheimer
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, or D): ; response: ||To answer this question, I need to know when Akshay Venkatesh received the Salem Prize and who received it in the subsequent years.

Akshay Venkatesh received the Salem Prize in 2007.

The Salem Prize winners after 2007 were:

Question:
What is the name of the man who succeeded Gösta Mittag-Leffler as a professor of mathematics at Stockholm University in July 1911?
----------
  A: Ivar Otto Bendixson
  B: Lars Edvard Phragmén
  C: Torsten Carleman
  D: Niels Fabian Helge von Koch
------------------------------
Your choice (A, B, C, or D): ; response: ||Looking at this question, I need to identify who succeeded Gösta Mittag-Leffler as professor of mathematics at Stockholm University (then Stockholm Högskola) in July 1911.

Gösta Mittag-Leffler held the chair of mathematics at Stockholm from 1881. When examining the candidates:

- Ivar Otto Bendixson (1861-1935) was a Swedish mathematician who worked at Stockholm
- Lars Edvard Phragmén (1863-1937) was also a Swedish mathematician
- Torsten Carleman (1892-1949) would have been only 19 in 1911, too young for such a position
- Helge von Koch (1870-1924) was a Swedish mathematician known for the Koch snowflake

Based on historical records, Ivar Bendixson succeeded Mittag-Leffler in this position in 1911.
