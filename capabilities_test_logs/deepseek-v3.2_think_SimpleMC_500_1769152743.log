REASONING TRACE:
First, the question is: "Who composed the music for the song 'We Rollin' by Punjabi singer Shubh?" The options are:

A: Gupz Sehra

B: Byg Byrd

C: Anabolic Beatz.

D: Ikky Productions

I need to recall who composed the music for that specific song. I'm familiar with Shubh, a Punjabi singer known for songs like "We Rollin". I think I remember that the music for "We Rollin" was produced by someone specific. Let me think.

I know Shubh has worked with various producers. For "We Rollin", I believe the producer or composer is Byg Byrd. I've seen credits on YouTube or streaming platforms. I should verify in my memory.

Option A: Gupz Sehra – I know Gupz Sehra is a producer, but I don't think he worked on "We Rollin". He might have worked on other Shubh songs like "Elevated" or "No Love", but I'm not sure about "We Rollin".

Option B: Byg Byrd – This rings a bell. I think Byg Byrd is indeed the producer for "We Rollin". I recall seeing "Byg Byrd" in the title or description of the song.

Option C: Anabolic Beatz – This is another producer, but I don't associate him with "We Rollin". He might have produced other Punjabi hits.

Option D: Ikky Productions – Ikky is a well-known producer in the Punjabi industry, but again, I don't think he produced "We Rollin".

To confirm, I should think about the song's credits. If I remember correctly, when "We Rollin" was released, it was often credited with "Byg Byrd" as the producer. Also, in the music video or on Spotify, it might list Byg Byrd as the composer.

Since I can't look it up, I have to rely on my memory. I'm pretty sure the answer is B: Byg Byrd.

Let me double-check. I know Shubh's song "We Rollin" is quite popular, and I've seen discussions about the producer being Byg Byrd. Also, in some articles or reviews, they mention Byg Byrd's production.

So, I'll go with B.
